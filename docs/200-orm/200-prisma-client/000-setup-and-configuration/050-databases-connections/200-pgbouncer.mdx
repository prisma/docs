<TopBlock>

An external connection pooler like PgBouncer holds a connection pool to the database, and proxies incoming client connections by sitting between Prisma Client and the database. This reduces the number of processes a database has to handle at any given time.

Usually, this works transparently, but some connection poolers only support a limited set of functionality. One common feature that external connection poolers do not support are named prepared statements, which Prisma uses. For these cases, Prisma can be configured to behave differently.

## PgBouncer

### Set PgBouncer to transaction mode

For Prisma Client to work reliably, PgBouncer must run in [**Transaction mode**](https://www.pgbouncer.org/features.html).

Transaction mode offers a connection for every transaction – a requirement for the Prisma Client to work with PgBouncer.

### Add <inlinecode>pgbouncer=true</inlinecode> to the connection URL

To use Prisma Client with PgBouncer, add the `?pgbouncer=true` flag to the PostgreSQL connection URL:

```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?pgbouncer=true
```

> Note: `PORT` specified for PgBouncer pooling is sometimes different from the default `5432` port. Check your database provider docs for the correct port number.

<summary>How `pgbouncer` mode works in Prisma</summary>

- Prisma opens a transaction for every query – even when just reading data, allowing Prisma to use prepared statements.
- Prisma does not try to set the `search_path`, which is not supported by PgBouncer.
- Prisma cleans up already present prepared statements in the connection by running `DEALLOCATE ALL` before preparing and executing Prisma Client queries.
- Prisma also disables any prepared statement or type query caches.

### Prisma Migrate and PgBouncer workaround

Prisma Migrate uses **database transactions** to check out the current state of the database and the migrations table. However, the Schema Engine is designed to use a **single connection to the database**, and does not support connection pooling with PgBouncer. If you attempt to run Prisma Migrate commands in any environment that uses PgBouncer for connection pooling, you might see the following error:

```bash
Error: undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement "s0" already exists
```

To work around this issue, you must connect directly to the database rather than going through PgBouncer. To achieve this, you can use the [`directUrl`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#fields) field in your [`datasource`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) block.

For example, consider the following `datasource` block:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = "postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?pgbouncer=true"
  directUrl = "postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
}
```

The block above uses a PgBouncer connection string as the primary URL using `url`, allowing Prisma Client to take advantage of the PgBouncer connection pooler.

It also provides a connection string directly to the database, without PgBouncer, using the `directUrl` field. This connection string will be used when commands that require a single connection to the database, such as `prisma migrate dev` or `prisma db push`, are invoked.

### PgBouncer with different database providers

There are sometimes minor differences in how to connect directly to a Postgres database that depend on the provider hosting the database.

Below are links to information on how to set up these connections with providers who have setup steps not covered here in our documentation:

- [Connecting directly to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Digital Ocean](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6157)
- [Connecting directly to a PostgreSQL database hosted on ScaleGrid](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6701#issuecomment-824387959)

## Supabase Supavisor

Supabase's Supavisor behaves similarly to [PgBouncer](#pgbouncer). You can add `?pgbouncer=true` to your connection pooled connection string available via your [Supabase database settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database).

## Other external connection poolers

Although Prisma does not have explicit support for other connection poolers, if the limitations are similar to the ones of [PgBouncer](#pgbouncer) you can usually also use `pgbouncer=true` in your connection string to put Prisma in a mode that works with them as well.
