# From https://github.com/marketplace/actions/image-actions
# image-actions will run in the following scenarios:
# - on pull requests containing images (not including forks)
# - on pushing of images to main (for forks)
# - on demand (https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/)
# - at 11pm every Sunday just in case anything gets missed with any of the above
# For pull requests, the images are added to the PR
# For the rest a new PR is opened if any images are compressed.
