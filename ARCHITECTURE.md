# Multi-Zone Architecture Overview

This repository is a pnpm monorepo with three closely related Next.js apps:

- `apps/site`: the main Prisma website and the public multi-zone entrypoint
- `apps/blog`: the blog zone
- `apps/docs`: the docs zone

At a high level, users experience docs and blog content as `www.prisma.io/docs/*` and `www.prisma.io/blog/*`, but those paths are served by separate Next.js apps behind the scenes.

## Two Layers

There are two architectural layers to keep in mind:

1. The monorepo layer decides how code is organized, shared, built, and run.
2. The runtime layer decides which app answers a given request.

The monorepo layer is defined by `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, the root `package.json`, and `turbo.json`.

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` includes `apps/*` and `packages/*`, so all apps and shared packages live in one workspace.
- The root `package.json` delegates common workflows to Turbo with `pnpm build`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm check`, and `pnpm types:check`.
- `turbo.json` defines the task graph, shared cache inputs, and build outputs for `.next`, `dist`, and cache folders.

This matches the useful Turborepo framing for this repo: package boundaries are managed at the workspace level, while runtime composition happens inside the app configs rather than through root scripts.

## Shared Packages

All three apps rely on shared workspace packages:

- `packages/ui` (`@prisma-docs/ui`): shared navigation, footer, theming, and UI helpers
- `packages/eclipse` (`@prisma/eclipse`): shared design system components and styles

That means the apps are separate deployable zones, but they still present a mostly unified UI by consuming the same package-level building blocks.

## App Roles

| App | Local port | Runtime role | Key routing config |
|------|------|------|------|
| `apps/site` | `3000` | Main website host and multi-zone entrypoint | `assetPrefix: "/site-static"` and cross-zone `rewrites()` |
| `apps/docs` | `3001` | Standalone docs zone | `basePath: "/docs"` and `assetPrefix: "/docs-static"` |
| `apps/blog` | `3002` | Standalone blog zone | `basePath: "/blog"` and `assetPrefix: "/blog-static"` |

## `apps/site`

`apps/site` is the root host zone. Its own `README.md` describes it as the "Primary host app for the multi-zone Next.js setup."

Important characteristics:

- It runs on port `3000`.
- It does not use a `basePath`.
- It serves its own static assets from `/site-static`.
- It owns the cross-zone rewrites that make docs and blog look like subpaths of the main site.
- It also contains a large `redirects()` table for legacy Prisma routes and hostnames.

The most important part of the multi-zone setup lives in `apps/site/next.config.mjs`:

```758:790:apps/site/next.config.mjs
        // Proxy canonical docs path to docs infrastructure
        {
          source: "/docs",
          destination: `${DOCS_ORIGIN}/docs`,
          missing: [{ type: "host", value: DOCS_ORIGIN_HOST }],
        },
        {
          source: "/docs/:any*",
          destination: `${DOCS_ORIGIN}/docs/:any*`,
          missing: [{ type: "host", value: DOCS_ORIGIN_HOST }],
        },
        {
          source: "/docs-static/:path*",
          destination: `${DOCS_ORIGIN}/docs-static/:path*`,
          missing: [{ type: "host", value: DOCS_ORIGIN_HOST }],
        },

        // Proxy canonical blog path to blog infrastructure
        {
          source: "/blog",
          destination: `${BLOG_ORIGIN}/blog`,
          missing: [{ type: "host", value: BLOG_ORIGIN_HOST }],
        },
```

Two details matter here:

- `NEXT_DOCS_ORIGIN` and `NEXT_BLOG_ORIGIN` tell the site app where the docs and blog deployments live.
- The `missing` host checks prevent the site from rewriting a request if it is already running on the docs or blog host, which avoids rewrite loops.

In production, `apps/site` requires both origin variables. In development, it falls back to `https://docs.prisma.io` and `https://blog.prisma.io` if they are unset.

## `apps/docs`

`apps/docs` is a standalone Next.js app that still expects to live under `/docs`.

Important characteristics:

- It runs on port `3001`.
- It sets `basePath: "/docs"`.
- It sets `assetPrefix: "/docs-static"`.
- Its root path redirects to `/docs`.
- It wraps the Next config in `withSentryConfig(...)`.
- Its build runs `fetch-openapi` before `next build`.

Content and structure are Fumadocs-driven:

- `apps/docs/source.config.ts` defines the main docs collection in `content/docs`.
- It also defines a versioned `content/docs.v6` collection.
- Docs frontmatter includes metadata fields like `url`, `metaTitle`, and `metaDescription`, which feed the docs app's routing and SEO layer.

The docs deployment also has its own `apps/docs/vercel.json`, but that file is primarily a large redirect map for old docs URLs. It is not what makes the multi-zone architecture work. The multi-zone behavior comes from `apps/site` rewriting to the docs origin.

## `apps/blog`

`apps/blog` is also a standalone Next.js app, but mounted under `/blog`.

Important characteristics:

- It runs on port `3002`.
- It sets `basePath: "/blog"`.
- It sets `assetPrefix: "/blog-static"`.
- Its root path redirects to `/blog`.
- It has tag redirects that rewrite older tag URLs into query-param based routes.

Blog content is also Fumadocs-based:

- `apps/blog/source.config.ts` defines a collection at `content/blog`.
- Blog frontmatter includes authors, date, hero image paths, tags, excerpts, and metadata fields.

Like docs, blog is a separate app and separate deployment target. The difference is that end users usually reach it through the main site's `/blog/*` path model.

## Request Flow

This is the request path users usually experience in production:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  user[UserBrowser]
  site[appsSite]
  blog[appsBlog]
  docs[appsDocs]
  ui[packagesUi]
  eclipse[packagesEclipse]

  user -->|"www.prisma.io/*"| site
  site -->|"rewrite /blog/*"| blog
  site -->|"rewrite /docs/*"| docs
  site --> ui
  site --> eclipse
  blog --> ui
  blog --> eclipse
  docs --> ui
  docs --> eclipse
```

In other words:

1. A browser hits `www.prisma.io`.
2. `apps/site` handles the request first.
3. If the path starts with `/docs` or `/blog`, `apps/site` proxies that request to the corresponding origin.
4. The target app still serves content with its own `basePath`, asset prefix, metadata rules, and local navigation.

This follows a Next.js multi-zone pattern: each zone owns its own app boundary, while the top-level host composes them into one public URL space.

## Why `basePath` and `assetPrefix` Matter

The Next.js-side separation is deliberate:

- `apps/docs` owns the `/docs` path space and `/docs-static` assets.
- `apps/blog` owns the `/blog` path space and `/blog-static` assets.
- `apps/site` stays at the root path space and uses `/site-static`.

That separation prevents static asset collisions and keeps each app self-contained enough to run on its own origin or locally on its own port.

This is also the main Next.js best-practice insight that explains the repo: each zone has a clear app boundary, and shared behavior is coordinated through config rather than by blurring the app edges.

## Cross-Zone Linking Nuances

The linking model is intentionally mixed, and that is one of the easiest parts of the system to misunderstand.

### Main site navigation

In `apps/site/src/app/layout.tsx`, the top-level `Docs` and `Blog` nav items point to absolute `https://www.prisma.io/docs` and `https://www.prisma.io/blog` URLs, while many other site links are root-relative like `/pricing` or `/orm`.

That biases navigation toward the canonical public host, even though docs and blog are separate deployments behind the scenes.

### Blog navigation

In `apps/blog/src/app/(blog)/layout.tsx`, the nav mixes absolute and relative links:

- `Docs` is linked as `/docs`
- `Blog` is linked as `https://www.prisma.io/blog`
- Most product pages point to absolute `https://www.prisma.io/...` URLs

This works well when the user is on `www.prisma.io`, because `/docs` is handled by the site rewrite layer. It is less universal when the blog app is visited directly on its own origin, because `/docs` then depends on how that origin is configured at the edge.

### Docs navigation

In `apps/docs/src/lib/layout.shared.tsx`, docs mostly links internally within the docs zone, but the Prisma logo links back to `https://www.prisma.io`.

That makes docs feel like part of the main site, even though it is operationally a separate app.

### Shared footer behavior

The shared footer data in `packages/ui/src/data/footer.ts` uses relative `/docs` and `/blog` paths.

`packages/ui/src/lib/is-absolute-url.ts` exposes `getRedirectableLink()`, which can convert relative links to `https://www.prisma.io/...` when `absoluteLinks` is enabled. By default, the footer can stay relative, which is fine on the main host but can behave differently off the canonical `www` origin.

## URL Generation and Metadata Nuances

Each app has its own base-URL helper:

- `apps/site/src/lib/url.ts`
- `apps/docs/src/lib/urls.ts`
- `apps/blog/src/lib/url.ts`

Those helpers are used for things like `metadataBase`, canonical URLs, OpenGraph data, and local defaults.

The behavior differs slightly by app:

- `apps/site` normalizes `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRISMA_URL`, falls back to `https://www.prisma.io` in production, and otherwise uses `VERCEL_URL` or `http://localhost:3000`.
- `apps/docs` and `apps/blog` follow the same production fallback to `https://www.prisma.io`, then `VERCEL_URL`, then their own local ports (`3001` and `3002`).

That means each zone can reason about its own canonical base URL, but it also means environment consistency matters if you want metadata to align cleanly across deployments.

### When to use `withDocsBasePath()` and `withBlogBasePath()`

The `withDocsBasePath()` and `withBlogBasePath()` helpers are mainly for URL strings that will not be processed by Next.js routing for you.

Use them when you are building a path manually for:

- metadata fields such as `alternates.canonical`, `openGraph.url`, and `openGraph.images`
- sitemap, robots, RSS, JSON-LD, and other SEO-oriented URL generation
- API endpoint strings like `/api/search`
- raw HTML elements such as `<a href="/...">` or `<img src="/...">`
- any other plain string URL that must include `/docs` or `/blog` explicitly

Do not use them when you are already using framework-aware components that respect `basePath`, especially:

- `next/link`
- `next/image`

In those cases, manually prefixing the path usually duplicates work and can create incorrect URLs.

### Fumadocs and MDX behavior

Fumadocs-backed pages generally already live inside a base-path-aware environment, so helpers are usually not needed for normal framework-managed navigation.

In this repo, that means:

- blog MDX exposes `Link` and `Image` from Next.js in `apps/blog/src/mdx-components.tsx`
- docs MDX uses Fumadocs defaults from `fumadocs-ui/mdx` in `apps/docs/src/mdx-components.tsx`

The important exception is raw `img` handling. Both apps override MDX `img` rendering and explicitly prefix raw image sources before passing them to `ImageZoom`, because plain image source strings are not automatically rewritten the way `next/image` and `next/link` inputs are:

- `apps/docs/src/mdx-components.tsx` uses `withDocsBasePathForImageSrc(...)`
- `apps/blog/src/mdx-components.tsx` uses `withBlogBasePathForImageSrc(...)`

So the practical rule is:

- if you are using Next or Fumadocs navigation/image components, you usually do not need the helper
- if you are emitting a raw path string or raw HTML tag, you usually do need the helper

### OG image and metadata patterns

Open Graph and other metadata fields are a common place where the helper is still required, even in Next apps.

That is because metadata APIs are string-based configuration, not rendered `next/link` or `next/image` components.

The repo already uses the helpers this way:

- docs metadata prefixes canonical URLs and OG image paths with `withDocsBasePath(...)` in `apps/docs/src/app/(docs)/(default)/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`
- blog metadata prefixes canonical URLs with `withBlogBasePath(...)` and image paths with `withBlogBasePathForImageSrc(...)` in `apps/blog/src/app/(blog)/[slug]/page.tsx`
- blog home metadata also prefixes its OG image path in `apps/blog/src/app/(blog)/page.tsx`

One extra nuance for blog is that some metadata image paths are converted all the way to absolute URLs for JSON-LD and article metadata by combining:

- `withBlogBasePathForImageSrc(...)` to add `/blog`
- `toAbsoluteUrl(...)` to anchor the result to the app's base URL

That pattern is important whenever a consumer expects a fully qualified URL instead of a root-relative path.

## Search Nuance

The site-level search endpoint in `apps/site/src/app/api/search/route.ts` normalizes blog and docs results back to `https://www.prisma.io`, not to the zone origins.

That is important because it confirms the public contract of the system:

- docs search results are surfaced as `https://www.prisma.io/docs/...`
- blog search results are surfaced as `https://www.prisma.io/blog/...`

So even when content is physically served by different apps, search treats the main site host as the canonical public URL namespace.

## Local Development Nuance

Root `pnpm dev` starts all relevant apps together:

- site on `http://localhost:3000`
- docs on `http://localhost:3001`
- blog on `http://localhost:3002`

The key caveat is that `apps/site` defaults `NEXT_DOCS_ORIGIN` and `NEXT_BLOG_ORIGIN` to the production subdomains if they are not explicitly set.

So a developer visiting `http://localhost:3000/docs` or `http://localhost:3000/blog` may accidentally proxy to production content unless those origin variables are pointed at local services.

That is the most important operational caveat in the whole setup.

## Deployment Notes

Deployment behavior is split across a few layers:

- Root `vercel.json` defines the install command for the monorepo.
- `apps/site/vercel.json` adds site-level redirects.
- `apps/docs/vercel.json` adds docs-specific redirects for legacy content.

But the architectural composition of the zones is still defined primarily in `apps/site/next.config.mjs`, not in `vercel.json`.

That distinction is important:

- `vercel.json` mostly handles deployment- and edge-level redirects.
- `next.config.mjs` defines how the apps compose into one public multi-zone site.

## Mental Model For Maintainers

When working in this repository, the safest mental model is:

- treat `apps/site`, `apps/blog`, and `apps/docs` as separate Next.js applications
- treat `packages/ui` and `packages/eclipse` as the shared presentation layer
- treat `apps/site` as the public traffic router for docs and blog
- treat `/docs` and `/blog` as canonical public paths, even when their content is served by separate origins

If a change affects navigation, canonical URLs, asset paths, or local dev routing, verify it in both contexts:

- when the user is on `www.prisma.io` through `apps/site`
- when the zone is accessed directly on its own app origin
