Connection pooling keeps a set of database connections open and reuses them across requests, rather than opening a new connection for every query. This reduces latency and lets your database handle more concurrent requests. This is especially important in serverless and high-traffic environments where connection limits can be exhausted quickly.

Prisma Postgres supports connection pooling through [TCP connections](#connection-pooling-with-tcp). You can also use [Prisma Accelerate](#connection-pooling-with-accelerate) for connection pooling with additional features like caching.

## Connection pooling with TCP

:::note
TCP connection pooling is currently in [Early Access](/console/more/feature-maturity#early-access).
:::

To use a pooled connection, append `&pooled=true` to your Prisma Postgres TCP connection string:

```bash
# Direct connection (no pooling)
DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@db.prisma.io:5432/?sslmode=require"

# Pooled connection
DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@db.prisma.io:5432/?sslmode=require&pooled=true"
```

You can also enable connection pooling when generating your connection string in the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) by toggling on the **pooling** option.

This works with any PostgreSQL client, ORM, or database tool you already use.

### Connection limits

The number of available connections depends on your plan and whether you use a pooled or direct connection:

|                        | Free | Starter | Pro | Business |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------- | --- | -------- |
| **Direct connections** | 10   | 10      | 50  | 100      |
| **Pooled connections** | 10   | 100     | 500 | 1000     |

Idle connections are closed after 60 minutes. You can compare plans on the [Prisma pricing page](https://www.prisma.io/pricing).

With TCP connections, there are no limits on query duration, transaction duration, or response size.

### When to use pooled vs. direct connections

| | **Direct** | **Pooled** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **How it works** | Your app connects straight to the database | Your app connects through a managed connection pooler |
| **Best for** | Local development, background jobs, low-concurrency workloads | Serverless functions, APIs, high-traffic or bursty workloads |
| **Typical usage** | Long-lived connections | Short-lived or burst connections |

For most production applications, pooled connections are recommended. Use direct connections when you need a persistent connection or are working in a low-concurrency environment like local development.

## Connection pooling with Accelerate

You can also connect to your Prisma Postgres database through [Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate), which provides built-in connection pooling along with a global [caching layer](/postgres/database/caching).

Accelerate uses a proxy-based approach and requires Prisma ORM with the Accelerate client extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "../generated/prisma/client";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  accelerateUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
}).$extends(withAccelerate());
```

Your Accelerate connection string uses the `prisma+postgres://` protocol:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
```

### Configurable limits

When connected via Accelerate, connection pool size, query duration, transaction duration, and response size have default limits that you can adjust from the **Settings** tab in your Prisma Postgres project in the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io).

#### Connection pool size

|                           | Free | Starter | Pro | Business |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ------- | --- | -------- |
| **Connection limit** | 10   | 100     | 500 | 1000     |

#### Query timeout

|                    | Free               | Starter            | Pro                | Business           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Query timeout**  | Up to 10 seconds   | Up to 10 seconds   | Up to 20 seconds   | Up to 60 seconds   |

:::warning
If your queries regularly take longer than 10 seconds, consider optimizing them. Long-running queries can indicate missing indexes or inefficient data access patterns. See the [error reference](/postgres/error-reference#p6009-responsesizelimitexceeded) for more details.
:::

#### Interactive transaction timeout

|                              | Free               | Starter            | Pro                | Business           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Transaction timeout**      | Up to 15 seconds   | Up to 15 seconds   | Up to 30 seconds   | Up to 90 seconds   |

When you increase the transaction timeout in the Prisma Console, you must also set a matching `timeout` in your application code:

```ts
await prisma.$transaction(
  async (tx) => {
    // Your queries here
  },
  {
    timeout: 30000, // 30s — must match your Console setting
  },
);
```

#### Response size

|                | Free        | Starter     | Pro          | Business     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| **Response size** | Up to 5 MB  | Up to 5 MB  | Up to 10 MB  | Up to 20 MB  |

See the [error reference](/postgres/error-reference#p6009-responsesizelimitexceeded) and [pricing page](https://www.prisma.io/pricing) for more information.
