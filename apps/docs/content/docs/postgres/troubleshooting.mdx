This guide helps resolve common issues when working with Prisma Postgres.

## The `--db` option is not recognized when running `prisma init`

### Problem

Running the following command fails because the `--db` option is not recognized:

```npm
npx prisma init --db
```

### Cause

This can occur due to npx caching. If you've previously run `npx prisma init`, your machine may be using an outdated cached version that doesn't recognize the `--db` flag because it was only introduced in a later version of Prisma ORM.

### Solution

Explicitly run the `latest` Prisma CLI version:

```npm
npx prisma@latest init --db
```

This ensures that you're using the most up-to-date CLI, preventing issues with outdated command syntax.

## Workspace plan limit reached when running `prisma init --db`

### Problem

When running the command:

```npm
npx prisma@latest init --db
```

You may encounter the following error message in your logs:

```
Workspace plan limit reached for feature "Project".
```

### Cause

Your default [workspace](/docs/console/concepts#workspace) project limit has been reached.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, consider the following options:

- Configure a different Workspace as your default—one that has available capacity for additional projects.
- Delete unused projects or databases from your current default Workspace to free up space.
- Ensure that you are logged into the correct account in the Prisma CLI. For more details on authentication and account management, please refer to the [Prisma CLI documentation](/docs/cli/console).
- [Upgrade to a plan](/docs/postgres#billing) that supports more projects in your default Workspace.

Implementing one or more of these solutions should help you overcome the plan limit issue.
