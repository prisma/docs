metaDescription: How to include unsupported database features for projects that use Prisma Migrate.
---

Prisma Migrate uses the Prisma schema to determine what features to create in the database. However, some database features [cannot be represented in the Prisma schema](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/unsupported-database-features) , including but not limited to:

- Stored procedures
- Triggers
- Views

To add an unsupported feature to your database, you must [customize a migration](/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/customizing-migrations) to include that feature before you apply it.

:::tip
Partial indexes are now supported in Prisma Schema Language via the `where` argument on `@@index`, `@@unique`, and `@unique`. See [Configuring partial indexes](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/indexes#configuring-partial-indexes-with-where) for details. You no longer need to customize migrations for partial indexes.

The Prisma schema is also able to represent [unsupported field types](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/unsupported-database-features#unsupported-field-types) and [native database functions](/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/native-database-functions).

:::warning
This guide **does not apply for MongoDB**.<br />
Instead of `migrate dev`, [`db push`](/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/prototyping-your-schema) is used for [MongoDB](/orm/core-concepts/supported-databases/mongodb).

## Customize a migration to include an unsupported feature

To customize a migration to include an unsupported feature:

- Use the `--create-only` flag to generate a new migration without applying it:

```npm
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
```

- Open the generated `migration.sql` file and add the unsupported feature - for example, a trigger function:

```sql title="migration.sql"
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_on_insert()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM pg_notify('new_record', NEW.id::text);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

- Apply the migration:

```npm
npx prisma migrate dev
```

- Commit the modified migration to source control.
