metaDescription: How to include unsupported database features for projects that use Prisma Migrate.
---

Prisma Migrate uses the Prisma schema to determine what features to create in the database. However, some database features [cannot be represented in the Prisma schema](/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/unsupported-database-features) , including but not limited to:

- Stored procedures
- Triggers
- Views
- Partial indexes

To add an unsupported feature to your database, you must [customize a migration](/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/customizing-migrations) to include that feature before you apply it.

:::tip
The Prisma schema is able to represent [unsupported field types](/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/unsupported-database-features#unsupported-field-types) and [native database functions](/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/native-database-functions).

:::warning
This guide **does not apply for MongoDB**.<br />
Instead of `migrate dev`, [`db push`](/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/prototyping-your-schema) is used for [MongoDB](/docs/orm/core-concepts/supported-databases/mongodb).

## Customize a migration to include an unsupported feature

To customize a migration to include an unsupported feature:

- Use the `--create-only` flag to generate a new migration without applying it:

```npm
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
```

- Open the generated `migration.sql` file and add the unsupported feature - for example, a partial index:

```sql title="migration.sql"
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tests_success_constraint
  ON posts (subject, target)
  WHERE success;
```

- Apply the migration:

```npm
npx prisma migrate dev
```

- Commit the modified migration to source control.
