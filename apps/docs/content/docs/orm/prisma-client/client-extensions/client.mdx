You can use the `client` [Prisma Client extensions](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions) component to add top-level methods to Prisma Client.

## Extend Prisma Client

Use the `$extends` [client-level method](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods) to create an _extended client_. An extended client is a variant of the standard Prisma Client that is wrapped by one or more extensions. Use the `client` extension component to add top-level methods to Prisma Client.

To add a top-level method to Prisma Client, use the following structure:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  client?: { ... }
})
```

### Example

The following example uses the `client` component to add two methods to Prisma Client:

- `$log` outputs a message.
- `$totalQueries` returns the number of queries executed by the current client instance.


```ts
let total = 0;
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  client: {
    $log: (s: string) => console.log(s),
    async $totalQueries() {
      return total;
    },
  },
  query: {
    $allModels: {
      async $allOperations({ query, args }) {
        total += 1;
        return query(args);
      },
    },
  },
});

async function main() {
  prisma.$log("Hello world");
  const totalQueries = await prisma.$totalQueries();
  console.log(totalQueries);
}
```
