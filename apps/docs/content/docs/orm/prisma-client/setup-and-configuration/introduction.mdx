Prisma Client is an auto-generated and type-safe query builder that's _tailored_ to your data. The easiest way to get started with Prisma Client is by following the **[Quickstart](/docs/prisma-orm/quickstart/sqlite)**.

[Quickstart (5 min)](/docs/prisma-orm/quickstart/sqlite)

## Prerequisites

In order to set up Prisma Client, you need a Prisma Config and a [Prisma schema file](/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview):

```ts title="prisma.config.ts" tab="Prisma Config"
import 'dotenv/config';
import { defineConfig, env } from 'prisma/config';

export default defineConfig({
  schema: './prisma/schema.prisma',
  datasource: {
    url: env('DATABASE_URL'),
  },
});
```

```prisma title="schema.prisma" tab="Prisma Schema"
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client"
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma"
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
}
```

## Installation

[Install the Prisma CLI](/docs/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference) and the Prisma Client library in your project:

```npm
npm install prisma --save-dev
npm install @prisma/client
```

## Generate the Client API

Prisma Client is based on the models in Prisma Schema. To provide the correct types, you need generate the client code:

```npm
npx prisma generate
```

This will create a `generated` directory based on where you set the `output` to in the Prisma Schema. Any time your import Prisma Client, it will need to come from this generated client API.

## Importing Prisma Client

With the client generated, import the version for the given environment and create a new instance of it:

```ts tab="Node"
import { PrismaClient } from "./path/to/generated/prisma";

export const prisma = new PrismaClient({});
```

```ts tab="Edge"
import { PrismaClient } from "./path/to/generated/prisma/edge";

export const prisma = new PrismaClient({});
```

Your application should generally only create **one instance** of `PrismaClient`. How to achieve this depends on whether you are using Prisma ORM in a [long-running application](/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections#prismaclient-in-long-running-applications) or in a [serverless environment](/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections#prismaclient-in-serverless-environments) .

Creating multiple instances of `PrismaClient` will create multiple connection pools and can hit the connection limit for your database. Too many connections may start to **slow down your database** and eventually lead to errors such as:

```bash
Error in connector: Error querying the database: db error: FATAL: sorry, too many clients already
   at PrismaClientFetcher.request
```

## Driver Adapters

Depending on the database being used, an adapter is needed in order for Prisma Client to be able send the appropriate SQL queries:

```ts tab="Prisma Postgre"
import { PrismaClient } from "./path/to/generated/prisma";
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'

const adapter = new PrismaPg({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
})

export const prisma = new PrismaClient({adapter});
```


```ts tab="Prisma Postgres Serverless"
import { PrismaClient } from "./path/to/generated/prisma/edge";
import { PrismaPostgresAdapter } from "@prisma/adapter-ppg";

const adapter = new PrismaPg({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
})

export const prisma = new PrismaClient({adapter});
```

Find out what [driver adapter](/docs/orm/core-concepts/supported-databases/database-drivers) is needed for your database


## Use Prisma Client to send queries to your database

Once you have instantiated `PrismaClient`, you can start sending queries in your code:

```ts
// run inside `async` function
const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@prisma.io",
  },
});

const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
```

## Evolving your application

Whenever you make changes to your database that are reflected in the Prisma schema, you need to manually re-generate Prisma Client to update the generated code in your output directory:

```npm 
npx prisma generate
```
