A data source determines how Prisma ORM connects to your database, and is represented by the [`datasource`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) block in the Prisma schema. Connection details (such as the database URL) are configured in [Prisma Config](/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference). The following data source uses the `postgresql` provider:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
}
```

A Prisma schema can only have _one_ data source. However, you can:

- [Override the database connection when creating your `PrismaClient`](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference)
- [Specify a different **database** for Prisma Migrate's shadow database if you are working with cloud-hosted development databases](/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/shadow-database#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases-must-be-created-manually)


## Securing database connections

Some data source `provider`s allow you to configure your connection with SSL/TLS **by specifying certificate locations in your connection configuration**.

- [Configuring an SSL connection with PostgreSQL](/orm/core-concepts/supported-databases/postgresql#common-patterns)
- [Configuring an SSL connection with MySQL](/orm/core-concepts/supported-databases/mysql#common-patterns)
- [Configure a TLS connection with Microsoft SQL Server](/orm/core-concepts/supported-databases/sql-server#connection-details)

See the database-specific documentation above for examples of SSL/TLS connection configuration in Prisma Config.
