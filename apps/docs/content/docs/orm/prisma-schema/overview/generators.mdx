metaDescription: Generators in your Prisma schema specify what assets are generated when the `prisma generate` command is invoked. This page explains how to configure generators.
---

A Prisma schema can have one or more generators, represented by the [`generator`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#generator) block:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client"
  output   = "../generated/prisma"
}
```

A generator determines which assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command.

The default generator for Prisma Client is `prisma-client`, which outputs plain TypeScript code and _requires_ a custom `output` path (read more about it [here](https://www.prisma.io/blog/why-prisma-orm-generates-code-into-node-modules-and-why-it-ll-change)).

Alternatively, you can configure any npm package that complies with our generator specification.

## `prisma-client`

The new `prisma-client` generator offers greater control and flexibility when using Prisma ORM across different JavaScript environments (such as ESM, Bun, Deno, ...).

It generates Prisma Client into a custom directory in your application's codebase that's specified via the `output` field on the `generator` block. This gives you full visibility and control over the generated code. It also [splits](#importing-types) the generated Prisma Client library into multiple files.

This generator ensures you can bundle your application code exactly the way you want, without relying on hidden or automatic behaviors.

Here are the main differences compared to `prisma-client-js`:

- Requires an `output` path; no "magic" generation into `node_modules` any more
- Doesn't load `.env` at runtime; use `dotenv` or set environment variables manually instead
- Supports ESM and CommonJS via the `moduleFormat` field
- More flexible thanks to additional [fields](#field-reference)
- Outputs plain TypeScript that's bundled just like the rest of your application code

The `prisma-client` generator is the default generator.

### Getting started

Follow these steps to use the new `prisma-client` generator in your project.

#### 1. Configure the `prisma-client` generator in `schema.prisma`

Update your [`generator`](/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators) block:

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma"
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client"            // Required // [!code ++]
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma"  // Required // [!code ++]
}
```

The **`output` option is required** and tells Prisma ORM where to put the generated Prisma Client code. You can choose any location suitable for your project structure. For instance, if you have the following layout:

```txt
.
├── package.json
├── prisma
│   └── schema.prisma
├── src
│   └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

Then `../src/generated/prisma` places the generated code in `src/generated/prisma` relative to `schema.prisma`.

#### 2. Generate Prisma Client

Generate Prisma Client by running:

```npm
npx prisma generate
```

This generates the code for Prisma Client (including the query engine binary) into the specified `output` folder.

#### 3. Use Prisma Client in your application

#### Importing Prisma Client

After generating the Prisma Client, import it from the path you specified:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma/client";
import { PrismaPg } from "@prisma/adapter-pg"; // or the adapter for your database
const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter });
```

Prisma Client is now ready to use in your project.

#### Importing generated model types

If you're importing types generated for your models, you can do so as follows:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { UserModel, PostModel } from "./generated/prisma/models";
```

#### Importing generated enum types

If you're importing types generated for your enums, you can do so as follows:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { Role, User } from "./generated/prisma/enums";
```

#### Importing in browser environments

If you need to access generated types in your frontend code, you can import them as follows:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { Role } from "./generated/prisma/browser";
```

Note that `./generated/prisma/browser` does not expose a `PrismaClient`.

### Field reference

Use the following options in the `generator client { ... }` block. Only `output` is required. The other fields have defaults or are inferred from your environment and `tsconfig.json`.

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
generator client {
  // Required
  provider = "prisma-client"
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma"

  // Optional
  engineType             = "client"
  runtime                = "nodejs"
  moduleFormat           = "esm"
  generatedFileExtension = "ts"
  importFileExtension    = "ts"
}
```

Below are the options for the `prisma-client` generator:

| **Option**               | **Default**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `output` (**required**)  |                           | Directory where Prisma Client is generated, e.g. `../src/generated/prisma`.                                                                                            |
| `runtime`                | `nodejs`                  | Target runtime environment. <br />Supported values: <br />`nodejs`, `deno`, `bun`, `workerd` (alias `cloudflare`), `vercel-edge` (alias `edge-light`), `react-native`. |
| `moduleFormat`           | Inferred from environment | Module format (`esm` or `cjs`). Determines whether `import.meta.url` or `__dirname` is used.                                                                           |
| `generatedFileExtension` | `ts`                      | File extension for generated TypeScript files (`ts`, `mts`, `cts`).                                                                                                    |
| `importFileExtension`    | Inferred from environment | File extension used in **import statements**. Can be `ts`, `mts`, `cts`, `js`, `mjs`, `cjs`, or empty (for bare imports).                                              |

:::note

`nodejs`, `deno`, and `bun` all map to the same internal codepath but are preserved as separate user-facing values for clarity.

:::

### Importing types

The new `prisma-client` generator creates individual `.ts` files which allow for a more fine granular import of types. This can improve compile and typecheck performance and be useful for tree-shaking, too.
You can still use the top level barrel files that export all types through a single import.

The overall structure of the generated output looks like this:

```
generated/
└── prisma
    ├── browser.ts
    ├── client.ts
    ├── commonInputTypes.ts
    ├── enums.ts
    ├── internal
    │   ├── ...
    ├── models
    │   ├── Post.ts
    │   └── User.ts
    └── models.ts
```

#### `client.ts`

For use in your server code.

- Provides access to the `PrismaClient` instance and all model and utility types.
- Provides best compatibility with the `prisma-client-js` generated output.
- Contains transitive dependencies on server only-packages, so cannot be used in browser contexts.

Example:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { Prisma, type Post, PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma/client";
```

#### `browser.ts`

For using types in your frontend (i.e. code that runs in the browser).

- Contains no transitive dependencies on Node.js or other server-only packages.
- Contains no real `PrismaClient` constructor.
- Contains all model and enum types and values.
- Provides access to various utilities like `Prisma.JsonNull` and `Prisma.Decimal`.


Example:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { Prisma, type Post } from "./generated/prisma/browser";
```

#### `enums.ts`

Isolated access to user defined enum types and values.

- Contains no transitive dependencies and is very slim.
- Can be used on backend and frontend.
- Prefer this for optimal tree shaking and typecheck performance when accessing enums.

Example:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { MyEnum } from "./generated/prisma/enums";
```

#### `models.ts`

Isolated access to all model types.

- Can be used on backend and frontend.
- Contains all models including their derived utility types like `<ModelName>WhereInput` or `<ModelName>UpdateInput>`.

:::note

Plain model types are exposed here as `<ModelName>Model` (e.g. `PostModel`). This is in contrast to the exposed name in `client.ts` and `browser.ts` which is simply `<ModelName>` (e.g. `Post`).

This is necessary due to internal constraints to avoid potential naming conflicts with internal types.

:::

Example:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import type {
  UserModel,
  PostModel,
  PostWhereInput,
  UserUpdateInput,
} from "./generated/prisma/models";
```

#### `models/<ModelName>.ts`

Isolated access to the types for an individual model.

- Can be used on backend and frontend.
- Contains the models including its derived utility types like `<ModelName>WhereInput` or `<ModelName>UpdateInput>`.

:::note

The plain model type is exposed here as `<ModelName>Model` (e.g. `PostModel`).

:::

Example:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import type { UserModel, UserWhereInput, UserUpdateInput } from "./generated/prisma/models/User";
```

#### `commonInputTypes.ts`

Provides shared utility types that you should rarely directly need.

Example:

```ts
import type { IntFilter } from "./generated/prisma/commonInputTypes";
```

#### `internal/*`

:::warning

Do not directly import from these files! They are not part of the stable API of the generated code and can change at any time in breaking ways.

Usually anything you might need from there is exposed via `browser.ts` or `client.ts` under the `Prisma` namespace.

:::

### Breaking changes from `prisma-client-js`

- Requires an `output` path on the `generator` block
- No `Prisma.validator` function; you can use TypeScript native [`satisfies`](https://www.prisma.io/blog/satisfies-operator-ur8ys8ccq7zb) keyword instead

## `prisma-client-js` (Deprecated)

:::warning[Deprecated]

The `prisma-client-js` generator is deprecated. We recommend using [`prisma-client`](#prisma-client) for new projects and updating existing projects when possible.

:::

The `prisma-client-js` generator requires the `@prisma/client` npm package and generates Prisma Client into `node_modules`.

### Field reference

The generator for Prisma's JavaScript Client accepts multiple additional properties:

- `previewFeatures`: [Preview features](/orm/reference/preview-features/client-preview-features) to include
- `binaryTargets`: Engine binary targets for `prisma-client-js` (for example, `debian-openssl-1.1.x` if you are deploying to Ubuntu 18+, or `native` if you are working locally)

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma"
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["sample-preview-feature"]
  binaryTargets   = ["debian-openssl-1.1.x"] // defaults to `"native"`
}
```

## Community generators

:::note

Existing generators or new ones should not be affected if you are using a [multi-file Prisma schema](/orm/prisma-schema/overview/location#multi-file-prisma-schema), unless a generator reads the schema manually.
