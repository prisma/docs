A relation is a _connection_ between two models in the Prisma schema. For example, there is a one-to-many relation between `User` and `Post` because one user can have many blog posts:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id       Int  @id @default(autoincrement())
  author   User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int  // Foreign key connecting Post to User
  title    String
}
```

At a Prisma ORM level, the `User` / `Post` relation consists of:

- **Relation fields** (`author` and `posts`): Define connections at Prisma ORM level, do not exist in the database
- **Relation scalar field** (`authorId`): The foreign key that exists in the database

## Relations in the database

### Relational databases

In SQL, you use a _foreign key_ to create a relation between two tables:

- A foreign key column (`authorId`) in `Post` references the primary key (`id`) in `User`

```prisma
author     User        @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
```

:::note
Relations in the Prisma schema represent relationships that exist between tables in the database.

### MongoDB

MongoDB uses a normalized data model design where documents reference each other by ID:

```json
// User document
{ "_id": { "$oid": "60d5922d00581b8f0062e3a8" }, "name": "Ella" }

// Post documents referencing the user
{ "_id": "...", "title": "How to make sushi", "authorId": { "$oid": "60d5922d00581b8f0062e3a8" } }
```

If using `ObjectId`, add `@db.ObjectId` to both the model ID and relation scalar field:

```prisma
model Post {
  id       String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId String @db.ObjectId
}
```

## Relations in Prisma Client

### Create records with nested relations

```ts
const userAndPosts = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    posts: {
      create: [{ title: "Prisma Day 2020" }, { title: "How to write a Prisma schema" }],
    },
  },
});
```

### Retrieve records with related data

```ts
const getAuthor = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: "20" },
  include: { posts: true },
});
```

### Connect existing records

```ts
await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: 20 },
  data: {
    posts: { connect: { id: 4 } },
  },
});
```

## Types of relations

There are three different types (or [cardinalities](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_(data_modeling)>)) of relations in Prisma ORM:

- [One-to-one](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/one-to-one-relations) (also called 1-1 relations)
- [One-to-many](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/one-to-many-relations) (also called 1-n relations)
- [Many-to-many](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations) (also called m-n relations)

The following Prisma schema includes every type of relation:

- one-to-one: `User` ↔ `Profile`
- one-to-many: `User` ↔ `Post`
- many-to-many: `Post` ↔ `Category`

```prisma tab="Relational databases"
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     Int  @id @default(autoincrement())
  user   User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int  @unique // relation scalar field (used in the `@relation` attribute above)
}

model Post {
  id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  author     User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId   Int // relation scalar field  (used in the `@relation` attribute above)
  categories Category[]
}

model Category {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

```prisma tab="MongoDB"
model User {
  id      String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId String @unique @db.ObjectId // relation scalar field (used in the `@relation` attribute above)
}

model Post {
  id          String     @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  author      User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId    String     @db.ObjectId // relation scalar field  (used in the `@relation` attribute above)
  categories  Category[] @relation(fields: [categoryIds], references: [id])
  categoryIds String[]   @db.ObjectId
}

model Category {
  id      String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  posts   Post[]   @relation(fields: [postIds], references: [id])
  postIds String[] @db.ObjectId
}
```

:::info

This schema is the same as the [example data model](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models) but has all [scalar fields](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models#scalar-fields) removed (except for the required [relation scalar fields](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations#relation-fields)) so you can focus on the [relation fields](#relation-fields).

:::

:::info

This example uses [implicit many-to-many relations](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations). These relations do not require the `@relation` attribute unless you need to [disambiguate relations](#disambiguating-relations).

:::

Notice that the syntax is slightly different between relational databases and MongoDB - particularly for [many-to-many relations](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations).

For relational databases, the following entity relationship diagram represents the database that corresponds to the sample Prisma schema:

![The sample schema as an entity relationship diagram](/img/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/sample-schema.png)

For MongoDB, Prisma ORM uses a [normalized data model design](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/), which means that documents reference each other by ID in a similar way to relational databases. See [the MongoDB section](#mongodb) for more details.

### Implicit and explicit many-to-many relations

Many-to-many relations in relational databases can be modelled in two ways:

- [explicit many-to-many relations](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations#explicit-many-to-many-relations), where the relation table is represented as an explicit model in your Prisma schema
- [implicit many-to-many relations](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations), where Prisma ORM manages the relation table and it does not appear in the Prisma schema.

Implicit many-to-many relations require both models to have a single `@id`. Be aware of the following:

- You cannot use a [multi-field ID](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference)
- You cannot use a `@unique` in place of an `@id`

To use either of these features, you must set up an explicit many-to-many instead.

The implicit many-to-many relation still manifests in a relation table in the underlying database. However, Prisma ORM manages this relation table.

If you use an implicit many-to-many relation instead of an explicit one, it makes the [Prisma Client API](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/introduction) simpler (because, for example, you have one fewer level of nesting inside of [nested writes](/orm/prisma-client/queries/relation-queries#nested-writes)).

If you're not using Prisma Migrate but obtain your data model from [introspection](/orm/prisma-schema/introspection), you can still make use of implicit many-to-many relations by following Prisma ORM's [conventions for relation tables](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations#relation-table-conventions).

## Relation fields

Relation fields are fields on a Prisma model whose type is another model (not a scalar type). Every relation needs exactly two relation fields, one on each model.

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[] // relation field
}

model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id]) // annotated relation field
  authorId Int    // relation scalar field (foreign key)
}
```

**Key concepts:**

- `posts` and `author` are relation fields (exist at Prisma ORM level only)
- `authorId` is the relation scalar field (exists in the database as foreign key)

### Annotated relation fields

Relations annotated with `@relation` attribute (one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many for MongoDB) represent the side that stores the foreign key:

```prisma
author     User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
authorId   Int     // relation scalar field
```

**Naming convention:** Relation scalar fields typically use the pattern `fieldName` + `Id` (e.g., `author` → `authorId`).

## The `@relation` attribute

The `@relation` attribute is required when:

- Defining one-to-one or one-to-many relations
- Disambiguating multiple relations between the same models
- Defining [self-relations](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/self-relations)
- Defining many-to-many relations for MongoDB

:::note
[Implicit many-to-many relations](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations) in relational databases do not require `@relation`.
:::

## Disambiguating relations

When you have two relations between the same models, use the `name` argument in `@relation` to disambiguate:

```prisma
model User {
  id           Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  writtenPosts Post[]  @relation("WrittenPosts")
  pinnedPost   Post?   @relation("PinnedPost")
}

model Post {
  id         Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  author     User    @relation("WrittenPosts", fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId   Int
  pinnedBy   User?   @relation("PinnedPost", fields: [pinnedById], references: [id])
  pinnedById Int?    @unique
}
```

The `name` must be the same on both sides of the relation.
