metaTitle: prisma migrate status | Check Migration Status
metaDescription: 'Check migration status with prisma migrate status. Compare migration files to _prisma_migrations table. Identify pending or failed migrations.'
url: /docs/cli/migrate/status
---

The `prisma migrate status` command checks the migrations in `./prisma/migrations/*` and the entries in the `_prisma_migrations` table to report the state of your migrations.

:::warning

This command is not supported on [MongoDB](/orm/core-concepts/supported-databases/mongodb). Use [`db push`](/cli/db/push) instead.

:::

## Usage

```bash
prisma migrate status [options]
```

The datasource URL configuration is read from the Prisma config file (e.g., `prisma.config.ts`).

## Options

| Option         | Description                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `-h`, `--help` | Display help message                   |
| `--config`     | Custom path to your Prisma config file |
| `--schema`     | Custom path to your Prisma schema      |

## Exit codes

In versions 4.3.0 and later, `prisma migrate status` exits with code 1 when:

- A database connection error occurs
- Migration files haven't been applied to the database
- Migration history has diverged from the database state
- No migration table is found
- Failed migrations are found

## Example output

```text
Status
3 migrations found in prisma/migrations

Your local migration history and the migrations table from your database are different:

The last common migration is: 20201127134938_new_migration

The migration have not yet been applied:
20201208100950_test_migration

The migrations from the database are not found locally in prisma/migrations:
20201208100950_new_migration
```

## Examples

### Check migration status

```npm
npx prisma migrate status
```

### Specify a schema path

```npm
npx prisma migrate status --schema=./alternative/schema.prisma
```
