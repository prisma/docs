# Prisma Accelerate

[Prisma Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/accelerate) is a fully managed global connection pool and caching layer for your existing database, enabling query-level cache policies directly from the Prisma ORM.

With 15+ global regions, the connection pool scales your app for a global audience, particularly for serverless deployments that risk connection timeouts during peak times.

Accelerate's global cache, hosted in 300+ locations, ensures a fast experience for users, regardless of your database's location.

You can configure query-level caching strategies directly in your code with Prisma ORM, making setup and tuning easy.

Together, the connection pool and cache allow you to scale effortlessly and handle traffic spikes without infrastructure concerns.
