## Installation

Prisma Studio comes bundled with the Prisma CLI. To get started, make sure you have Node.js installed, then install the Prisma CLI:

```npm
npm install -g prisma
```

## Launching Studio

### With a Prisma Project

If you have an existing Prisma project, navigate to your project directory and run:

```npm
npx prisma studio
```

This will start the Studio server and open it in your default browser at `http://localhost:5555`.

### Without a Prisma Project

You can also use Studio with any database by providing a connection string:

```npm
npx prisma studio --url="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/yourdb"
```

## Connecting to Your Database

1. **Using environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in your project root with your database URL:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/yourdb"
   ```

   Then run: `npx prisma studio`

2. **Using command line**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio --url="your-database-connection-string"
   ```
