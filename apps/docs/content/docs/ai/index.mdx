In the era of AI, where code is increasingly written by agents, ensuring clarity, type safety, and reliable infrastructure is essential. With 5+ years of leadership in the TypeScript ecosystem, Prisma ORM and Prisma Postgres provide the proven foundation for AI-assisted development.

## Get started

Run the following command to bootstrap your database with a prompt:

```npm
npx prisma init --prompt "Create a habit tracker application"
```

## AI Coding Tools

Prisma ORM and Prisma Postgres integrate seamlessly with your AI coding tools. Check out our documentation with tips and tricks for working with Prisma in various AI editors.

- [Cursor](/ai/tools/cursor) - Define project-specific rules and use your schema as context to generate accurate queries and code.
- [Windsurf](/ai/tools/windsurf) - Automate your database workflows by generating schemas, queries, and seed data in this AI-powered editor.
- [Github Copilot](/ai/tools/github-copilot) - Get Prisma-aware code suggestions, run CLI commands from chat, and query the Prisma docs.
- [ChatGPT](/ai/tools/chatgpt) - Learn how to connect the Prisma MCP server to ChatGPT to manage your databases with natural language.

## Agent Skills

AI agents often generate outdated Prisma v6 code. Install Prisma Skills to give your agent accurate, up-to-date v7 knowledge - CLI commands, Client API, upgrade guides, database setup, and Prisma Postgres workflows.

```npm
npx skills add prisma/skills
```

## MCP server

With Prisma's MCP server, your AI tool can take database actions on your behalf: Provisioning a new Prisma Postgres instance, creating database backups and executing SQL queries are just a few of its capabilities.
