AI coding agents often struggle with Prisma 7 -they generate outdated v6 patterns, hallucinate APIs, and miss breaking changes like ESM-only support and required driver adapters. **Prisma Skills** fix this by giving your agent accurate, version-specific knowledge it can reference automatically.

Skills are packaged instructions that follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format. Once installed, your agent uses them whenever it detects a relevant task -no prompting required.

## Install

Add all Prisma skills to your project:

```npm
npx skills add prisma/skills
```

Or install only the ones you need:

```npm
npx skills add prisma/skills --skill prisma-client-api
```

:::note

Skills are compatible with any agent that supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format, including Claude Code, Cursor, and others.
