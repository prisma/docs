You can have a single workspace that hosts several databases. Within each database, you can view detailed reports on how your database is performing, with various metrics like:

- Average response size
- Average query duration
- Total egress
- Total operations
- Cache utilization

## Databases

For Prisma Postgres projects, the **Database** tab in the project view lets you configure and manage your databases. This interface provides tools to monitor and maintain your database resources. The **Connections** section displays a table with the following columns:

| Column Name   | Description                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hint**      | Provides the URL structure for the database in use.                              |
| **Static IP** | Indicates whether static IP is enabled for the database and associated products. |
| **Products**  | Lists the products that are enabled using the database URL.                      |
| **Action**    | Allows you to disable all active products and remove the connection.             |
