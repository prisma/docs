## Generating an Optimize API key

To obtain the Optimize API key:

1. Navigate to the workspace where you want to use Optimize.
2. Ensure that Optimize is launched. If it isn't, click the **Generate API key** button.
3. In Optimize, click your profile name in the top right corner of the navbar.
4. Select **Settings**.
