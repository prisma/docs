## Overview

The [Console](https://console.prisma.io/login) enables you to manage and configure your projects that use Prisma products, and helps you integrate them into your application:

- [Accelerate](/accelerate): Speeds up your queries with a global database cache with scalable connection pooling.
- [Optimize](/optimize): Provides you recommendations that can help you make your database queries faster.
- [Prisma Postgres](/postgres): A managed PostgreSQL database that is optimized for Prisma ORM.

## Getting started

To start using Prisma products, you'll need to:

1. Create a Console account
2. Set up a workspace for your team
3. Create a project for your application
4. Generate API keys for your resources

Learn more in the [Getting Started](/console/getting-started) guide.

## Core concepts

The Console is organized around four main concepts:

- **[User account](/console/concepts#user-account)**: Your personal account to manage workspaces and projects
- **[Workspaces](/console/concepts#workspace)**: Team-level container where billing is managed
- **[Projects](/console/concepts#project)**: Application-level container within a workspace
- **[Resources](/console/concepts#resources)**: Actual services or databases within a project (databases for Prisma Postgres, environments for Accelerate)

Read more about [Console concepts](/console/concepts).

## Console CLI

In addition to the web interface, the Prisma CLI provides another way to interact with your Console account and manage Prisma products. This can be useful for programmatic access, such as integrating into CI workflows.

Learn more about the [Console CLI commands](/cli/console).

## API keys

An API key is required to authenticate requests from your Prisma Client to products such as Prisma Accelerate and Prisma Optimize. API keys are generated and managed at the resource level.
