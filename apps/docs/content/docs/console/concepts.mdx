The Console workflows are based on four main concepts:

- [**User account**](#user-account): In order to use Prisma products, you need to have a Console user account. A _user_ will typically create one user account to manage all their workspaces, projects and resources. The _user_ can also be invited to join other workspaces to collaborate on the projects in that workspace.
- [**Workspaces**](#workspace): A user account can belong to multiple workspaces. A workspace typically represents a _team_ of individuals working together on one or more projects. **Billing is on a workspace level**, i.e. the invoice for a workspace at the end of the month captures all costs associated with the projects in that workspace.
- [**Projects**](#project): A project belongs to a workspace. It typically represents the _application_ or _service_ a team is working on.
- [**Resources**](#resources): Resources represent the actual services or databases within a project. For example, in Prisma Postgres, each project can contain multiple databases. For Accelerate, resources might correspond to different environments (like `Development`, `Staging`, or `Production`). **API keys are provisioned at the resource level**, and products are configured per resource as well (e.g., the database connection string used for Accelerate).

Here is a visual illustration of how these concepts relate to each other:

![How the concepts of the Console (user account, workspaces, projects, and resources) relate to each other](/img/platform/pdp-concepts.png)

## User account

A user account is the prerequisite for any interactions with Prisma products. You can use it to manage your workspaces (and their projects). A user account can be invited to collaborate on workspaces created by other users as well.

If you need to delete your user account, go [here](/console/more/support#deleting-your-pdp-account).

## Workspace

You can create several workspaces. A workspace is an isolated space to host projects. A workspace can have multiple user accounts associated with it so that multiple users can collaborate on the projects in the workspace.

In each workspace, you can:

- view and manage all projects (and their resources) in that workspace.
- manage billing, i.e. select a [subscription plan](https://www.prisma.io/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=platform-docs), configure payment methods, or view the invoice history.
- view the usage of your enabled Prisma products across all projects in that workspace.
- invite other users to collaborate in the workspace.
- access the [Optimize dashboard](https://console.prisma.io/optimize?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=optimize-docs) to measure query performance and receive AI-powered recommendations.

### CLI commands

List all workspaces:

```npm
npx prisma platform workspace show --early-access
```

## Project

In each workspace, you can create several projects. A project typically represents an application (a product or service). You typically have one [Prisma schema](/orm/prisma-schema/overview) per project.

In each project, you can:

- view and manage all resources (like databases) in that project.

The number of projects you can create in a workspace depends on the [subscription plan](https://www.prisma.io/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=platform-docs) configured in that workspace.

### CLI commands

List all projects in a workspace:

```npm
npx prisma platform project show --workspace $WORKSPACE_ID --early-access
```

Create a new project:

```npm
npx prisma platform project create --workspace $WORKSPACE_ID --name "My Project" --early-access
```

Delete a project:

```npm
npx prisma platform project delete --project $PROJECT_ID --early-access
```

## Resources

Resources represent the actual services or databases within a project. The type of resources available depends on the Prisma products you're using:

- **For Prisma Postgres**: Each project can contain multiple databases. These databases are the primary resources you'll manage.
- **For Accelerate**: Resources typically correspond to different deployment stages (like `Development`, `Staging`, or `Production`).

In each project, you can:

- Create and manage multiple resources (databases or environments)
- Generate API keys specific to each resource
- Configure product-specific settings:
  - **For Prisma Postgres databases**:
    - View database metrics and performance
    - Configure connection settings
    - Manage database users and permissions
  - **For Accelerate resources**:
    - Set your database connection string
    - Configure the region for connection pooling
    - Adjust connection pool size and performance settings
    - Set query duration and response size limits
    - Enable static IP for secure connections

The number of resources you can create in a project depends on your [subscription plan](https://www.prisma.io/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=platform-docs).

### CLI commands

List all environments (resources) in a project:

```npm
npx prisma platform environment show --project $PROJECT_ID --early-access
```

Create a new environment:

```npm
npx prisma platform environment create --project $PROJECT_ID --name "production" --early-access
```

Delete an environment:

```npm
npx prisma platform environment delete --environment $ENVIRONMENT_ID --early-access
```
