The Console workflows are based on four main concepts:

- [**User account**](#user-account): In order to use Prisma products, you need to have a Console user account. A _user_ will typically create one user account to manage all their workspaces, projects and resources. The _user_ can also be invited to join other workspaces to collaborate on the projects in that workspace.
- [**Workspaces**](#workspace): A user account can belong to multiple workspaces. A workspace typically represents a _team_ of individuals working together on one or more projects. **Billing is on a workspace level**, i.e. the invoice for a workspace at the end of the month captures all costs associated with the projects in that workspace.
- [**Projects**](#project): A project belongs to a workspace. It typically represents the _application_ or _service_ a team is working on.
- [**Resources**](#resources): Resources represent the actual services or databases within a project. For example, in Prisma Postgres, each project can contain multiple databases. For Accelerate, resources might correspond to different environments (like `Development`, `Staging`, or `Production`). **API keys are provisioned at the resource level**, and products are configured per resource as well (e.g., the database connection string used for Accelerate).

Here is a visual illustration of how these concepts relate to each other:

## User account

A user account is the prerequisite for any interactions with Prisma products. You can use it to manage your workspaces (and their projects). A user account can be invited to collaborate on workspaces created by other users as well.

If you need to delete your user account, go [here](/docs/console/more/support#deleting-your-pdp-account).

## Workspace

You can create several workspaces. A workspace is an isolated space to host projects. A workspace can have multiple user accounts associated with it so that multiple users can collaborate on the projects in the workspace.

In each workspace, you can:

- view and manage all projects (and their resources) in that workspace.
- manage billing, i.e. select a [subscription plan](https://www.prisma.io/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=platform-docs), configure payment methods, or view the invoice history.
- view the usage of your enabled Prisma products across all projects in that workspace.
- invite other users to collaborate in the workspace.
- access the [Optimize dashboard](https://console.prisma.io/optimize?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=optimize-docs) to measure query performance and receive AI-powered recommendations.
