Below are the known limitations when using Prisma Optimize. If you are aware of any limitations that are missing, please let us know on the `#help-and-questions` channel in our community [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=intro_text).

## Query limit on a recording session

Each [recording session](/optimize/recordings) can contain a maximum of 10,000 queries. Once this limit is reached, the recording session will end.

## Recording limit per workspace

Each [workspace](/console/concepts#workspace) can contain a maximum of 100 [recordings](/optimize/recordings).

## Scope and constraints for Prisma AI

While [Prisma AI](/optimize/prisma-ai) can provide helpful guidance to implement a [recommendation](/optimize/recommendations), there are some important limitations to keep in mind:

- **Information and accuracy**: The AI provides advice based on a broad, general knowledge base and does not have direct access to Prisma ORM documentation. This may occasionally result in inaccuracies or outdated information.

- **Limited context and adaptation**: The AI does not persist conversations or learn from previous interactions. Its responses are generalized and may not always address the specific needs of advanced users.

- **Static knowledge and scope**: The AI's knowledge is static and may not include recent updates or best practices after a certain date. It provides advice only within the context of Prisma ORM and cannot modify or execute code, nor interact directly with user environments.

## Using Prisma Accelerate with the Optimize extension

When using the [Optimize client extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-optimize) with the [Accelerate client extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-accelerate), ensure the Accelerate client extension is added last to your extended `PrismaClient`. This allows cacheable operations to be received by Optimize.

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
  .$extends(
    withOptimize({
      apiKey: process.env.OPTIMIZE_API_KEY,
    }),
  )
  .$extends(withAccelerate());
```

## SQL references in MongoDB recommendations

Prisma Optimize provides helpful recommendations for MongoDB users, though some explanations from [Prisma AI](/optimize/prisma-ai) may reference SQL-specific concepts. However, the [recommendations](/optimize/recommendations) remain useful and applicable to MongoDB environments.

## Raw query visibility in MongoDB

Raw queries are visible in MongoDB, though the parameters passed to them are not displayed.

## Driver adapter compatibility

Prisma Optimize is not yet compatible with [driver adapters](/orm/core-concepts/supported-databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters). However, as a workaround, you can run your queries locally using the regular Prisma Client along with Prisma Optimize to inspect and improve query performance.
