## Can I use Optimize in production?

Prisma Optimize is intended for use in local development environments. It helps you analyze and optimize queries during development before deploying to production.

## What databases does Optimize support?

Optimize supports:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- CockroachDB
- MS SQL Server

## How many queries can I record?

Each recording session can contain up to 10,000 queries. Each workspace can have up to 100 recordings.

## Does Optimize work with Prisma Accelerate?

Yes, but you must apply the Accelerate extension after the Optimize extension:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
  .$extends(withOptimize())
  .$extends(withAccelerate());
```
