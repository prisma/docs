## Overview

Prisma Postgres comes with Prisma Studio built-in. You can use it in several ways:

- Run `npx prisma studio --url "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"` to use Studio locally on your machine (also works with any other database)
- Find the **Studio** tab in your project in the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) to use Studio online
- Install the [Prisma VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) to use Studio directly in VS Code
- [Embed Prisma Studio](/v6/postgres/database/prisma-studio/embedding-studio) in your own app (e.g. as an admin dashboard)

:::note

If you want to use Prisma Studio with another database than Prisma Postgres, check the docs [here](/v6/orm/tools/prisma-studio).
