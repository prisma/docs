title: "Using CURRENT_TIME"

The following raw SQL query uses the `CURRENT_TIME` function:

```ts
prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT CURRENT_TIME;`;
```

### Why this is a problem

The `CURRENT_TIME` keyword returns only the time (e.g., 14:30:00) without a date, making it unsuitable for tasks like logging or generating timestamps that require precise event tracking. It returns a value of type `timetz`, which was added for SQL standard compatibility but is generally discouraged.
