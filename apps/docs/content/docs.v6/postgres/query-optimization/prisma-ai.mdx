Prisma AI enables you to ask follow-up questions on a provided [recommendation](/docs/v6/postgres/query-optimization/recommendations) for additional clarity.

## Using the Prisma AI

To interact with the Prisma AI:

1. Select a recommendation from an Optimize [recording](/docs/v6/postgres/query-optimization/recordings).

Prisma AI helps you gain deeper insights into a recommendation and learn how to apply it effectively to your Prisma model.
