This guide demonstrates how to access the Prisma Data Platform using the [Prisma CLI](/v6/orm/tools/prisma-cli). Get started by ensuring you have the Prisma CLI installed, following our setup [instructions](/v6/orm/tools/prisma-cli#installation).

This integration, now in Early Access, expands the capabilities of the Prisma CLI, enabling management of your Platform projects directly from the command line. For a detailed overview of all the commands, please refer to the [Commands page](/v6/platform/platform-cli/commands).
