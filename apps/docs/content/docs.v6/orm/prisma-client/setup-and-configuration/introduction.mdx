Prisma Client is an auto-generated and type-safe query builder that's _tailored_ to your data. The easiest way to get started with Prisma Client is by following the **[Quickstart](/v6/prisma-orm/quickstart/sqlite)**.

[⭐ Quickstart (5 min)](/v6/prisma-orm/quickstart/sqlite)

The setup instructions [below](#set-up) provide a high-level overview of the steps needed to set up Prisma Client. If you want to get started using Prisma Client with your own database, follow one of these guides:

[🚀 Set up a new project from scratch](/v6/prisma-orm/quickstart/postgresql)

[➕ Add Prisma to an existing project](/v6/prisma-orm/add-to-existing-project/postgresql)

## Set up

### 1. Prerequisites

In order to set up Prisma Client, you need a [Prisma schema file](/v6/orm/prisma-schema/overview) with your database connection, the Prisma Client generator, and at least one model:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client"
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma"
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
}
```

Also make sure to [install the Prisma CLI](/v6/orm/tools/prisma-cli#installation):

```npm
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

```npm
npx prisma
```

### 2. Installation

Install Prisma Client in your project with the following command:

```npm
npm install @prisma/client
```

### 3. Importing Prisma Client

There are multiple ways to import Prisma Client in your project depending on your use case:

```ts tab="TypeScript"
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

```js tab="JavaScript"
const { PrismaClient } = require("./generated/prisma");

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

For edge environments, you can import Prisma Client as follows:

```ts tab="TypeScript"
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma/edge";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

```js tab="JavaScript"
const { PrismaClient } = require("./generated/prisma/edge");

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

> **Note**: If you're using [driver adapters](/v6/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters), you can import from the location specified in your generator's `output` path directly, e.g. `./src/generated/prisma`. No need to import from `./src/generated/prisma/edge`.

### 4. Use Prisma Client to send queries to your database

Once you have instantiated `PrismaClient`, you can start sending queries in your code:

```ts
// run inside `async` function
const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@prisma.io",
  },
});

const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
```

:::info

All Prisma Client methods return an instance of [`PrismaPromise`](/v6/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#prismapromise-behavior) which only executes when you call `await` or `.then()` or `.catch()`.

### 5. Evolving your application

Whenever you make changes to your database that are reflected in the Prisma schema, you need to manually re-generate Prisma Client to update the generated code in your output directory:

```
prisma generate
```
