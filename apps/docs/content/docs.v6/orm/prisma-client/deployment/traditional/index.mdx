If your application is deployed via a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider, whether containerized or not, it is a traditionally-deployed app. Common deployment examples include [Heroku](/v6/orm/prisma-client/deployment/traditional/deploy-to-heroku) and [Koyeb](/v6/orm/prisma-client/deployment/traditional/deploy-to-koyeb).
