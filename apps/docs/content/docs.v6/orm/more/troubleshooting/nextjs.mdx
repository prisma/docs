Prisma ORM and Next.js form a powerful combination for building modern web applications. This guide covers best practices, common issues, and solutions.

## Best practices for using Prisma Client in development

### Avoid multiple Prisma Client instances

When developing a Next.js application, one common issue is accidentally creating multiple instances of the Prisma Client. This often occurs due to Next.js's hot-reloading feature in development.

#### Why this happens

Next.js's hot-reloading feature reloads modules frequently to reflect code changes instantly. However, this can lead to multiple instances of Prisma Client being created, which consumes resources and might cause unexpected behavior.

#### Recommended solution

To avoid this, create a single Prisma Client instance by using a global variable:

```typescript
// lib/prisma.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "../prisma/generated/client";

const globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient };

export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma || new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
```

Using this approach ensures that only one instance of Prisma Client exists, even during hot-reloading in development.

## Setting Up Prisma ORM in a Monorepo

### Challenges of using Prisma ORM in monorepos

Monorepos allow multiple projects to share code and dependencies, making them a popular choice for modern development. However, using Prisma ORM in a monorepo can present challenges related to dependency resolution and schema management.

#### Key issues

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Multiple packages in a monorepo might lead to conflicts if they use different version of Prisma ORM.
2. **Schema Centralization**: Managing a single Prisma Schema across multiple projects can be complex.

#### Best practices for monorepo integration

- **Centralize the Prisma Schema**: Place the `schema.prisma` file in a shared package, such as `@myorg/db`, to ensure consistency.
- **Use a custom output directory for generated client**: Define a [custom output directory](/v6/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client#using-a-custom-output-path) for the generated Prisma Client to maintain consistency across packages.
- **Install dependencies in the root**: To prevent version conflicts, install Prisma ORM at the root of the monorepo.
- **Use NPM Scripts for Generation**:

  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "prisma:generate": "prisma generate --schema=./packages/db/schema.prisma"
    }
  }
  ```

## Dynamic usage of Prisma Client in Next.js

### Handling dynamic scenarios

Dynamic use cases, such as working with tenant-specific databases, require additional consideration when using Prisma ORM with Next.js.

#### Problem

Each tenant might have its own database, necessitating the creation of separate Prisma Clients at runtime. This can be complex in Next.js due to its hybrid rendering model.

#### Solution

Use a factory function to dynamically create Prisma Clients based on tenant-specific configurations:

```typescript
// lib/prismaDynamic.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "../prisma/generated/client";

type TenantConfig = {
  databaseUrl: string;
};

export function createPrismaClient(config: TenantConfig): PrismaClient {
  return new PrismaClient({
    datasources: {
      db: {
        url: config.databaseUrl,
      },
    },
  });
}
```

Ensure that you manage the lifecycle of dynamically created Prisma Clients to avoid resource exhaustion.

## Vercel build dependency caching

### Problem

If you deploy an application using Prisma ORM to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), you may run into the following error message on deployment:

```
Prisma has detected that this project was built on Vercel, which caches dependencies.
This leads to an outdated Prisma Client because Prisma's auto-generation isn't triggered.
To fix this, make sure to run the `prisma generate` command during the build process.

```

This occurs because Vercel caches the dependencies of your project until one of those dependencies changes. Prisma ORM uses a `postinstall` hook to generate Prisma Client when dependencies are installed. Because Vercel uses cached modules, this `postinstall` hook never gets run in subsequent deployments after the initial deployment.

### Solution

This issue can be solved by explicitly generating Prisma Client on every deployment. Running `prisma generate` before each deployment will ensure Prisma Client is up-to-date.

#### Option 1: Custom `postinstall` script (Recommended)

Within the `scripts` section of your project's `package.json` file, add `prisma generate` to the `postinstall` script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Add to build script

Prepend `prisma generate` to your build command:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "prisma generate && <actual-build-command>"
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Vercel UI build settings

Within your project's dashboard, go to **Settings** > **General** > **Build & Development Settings** and prepend `prisma generate` to the Build Command field.

## Netlify build dependency caching

### Problem

If you deploy an application using Prisma ORM to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), you may encounter a similar caching error:

```
Prisma has detected that this project was built on Netlify, which caches dependencies.
This leads to an outdated Prisma Client because Prisma's auto-generation isn't triggered.
To fix this, make sure to run the `prisma generate` command during the build process.

Learn how: https://pris.ly/d/netlify-build
```

### Solution

The same solutions apply as for Vercel:

#### Option 1: Custom `postinstall` script (Recommended)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Add to build script

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "prisma generate && <actual-build-command>"
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Netlify UI build settings

Within your project's dashboard, go to **Site Settings** > **Build & deploy** > **Continuous deployment** > **Build settings** and prepend `prisma generate` to the Build command field.
