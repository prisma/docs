Preview features are new features that can only be used by opting in using a corresponding feature flag.

## Enabling preview features

Some releases include Preview features that are not considered production-ready, and must be enabled before you can use them. For more information about enabling Preview features, refer to the following documentation:

- [Enable Prisma Client and schema preview features](/orm/reference/preview-features/client-preview-features)
- [Enable Prisma CLI preview features](/orm/reference/preview-features/cli-preview-features)

We do not recommend using Preview features in production.
