metaDescription: How to include unsupported database features for projects that use Prisma Migrate.

Prisma Migrate uses the Prisma schema to determine what features to create in the database. However, some database features [cannot be represented in the Prisma schema](/docs/v6/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/unsupported-database-features) , including but not limited to:

- Stored procedures
- Triggers
- Views
- Partial indexes

To add an unsupported feature to your database, you must [customize a migration](/docs/v6/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/customizing-migrations) to include that feature before you apply it.

:::tip

The Prisma schema is able to represent [unsupported field types](/docs/v6/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/unsupported-database-features#unsupported-field-types) and [native database functions](/docs/v6/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/native-database-functions).

:::warning

This guide **does not apply for MongoDB**.<br />
Instead of `migrate dev`, [`db push`](/docs/v6/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/prototyping-your-schema) is used for [MongoDB](/docs/v6/orm/overview/databases/mongodb).

## Customize a migration to include an unsupported feature

To customize a migration to include an unsupported feature:

1. Use the `--create-only` flag to generate a new migration without applying it:

   ```npm
   npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
   ```

1. Open the generated `migration.sql` file and add the unsupported feature - for example, a partial index:

   ```sql
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tests_success_constraint
     ON posts (subject, target)
     WHERE success;
   ```

1. Apply the migration:

   ```npm
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

1. Commit the modified migration to source control.
