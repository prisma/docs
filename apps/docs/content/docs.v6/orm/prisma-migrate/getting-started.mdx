This page explains how to get started with migrating your schema in a development environment using Prisma Migrate.

## Get started with Prisma Migrate from scratch

To get started with Prisma Migrate in a development environment:

Create a Prisma schema:

```prisma title="schema.prisma" showLineNumbers tab="Prisma 7"
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  published Boolean @default(true)
  authorId  Int
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
```

```prisma title="schema.prisma" showLineNumbers tab="Prisma 6"
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  published Boolean @default(true)
  authorId  Int
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
```

    :::tip

    You can use [native type mapping attributes](/v6/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/native-database-types) in your schema to decide which exact database type to create (for example, `String` can map to `varchar(100)` or `text`).

    :::

    For Prisma 7, be sure to have a `prisma.config.ts` in the root of your project:

    ```ts title="prisma.config.ts" showLineNumbers
    import 'dotenv/config'
    import { defineConfig, env } from "prisma/config";
    export default defineConfig({
      schema: "prisma/schema.prisma",
      migrations: {
        path: "prisma/migrations",
      },
      datasource: {
        url: env("DATABASE_URL"),
      },
    });
    ```

1.  Create the first migration:

    ```bash
    prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

    ```sql no-copy
      -- CreateTable
    CREATE TABLE "User" (
        "id" SERIAL,
        "name" TEXT NOT NULL,

        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
    );
      -- CreateTable
    CREATE TABLE "Post" (
        "id" SERIAL,
        "title" TEXT NOT NULL,
        "published" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
        "authorId" INTEGER NOT NULL,

        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
    );

      -- AddForeignKey
    ALTER TABLE "Post" ADD FOREIGN KEY("authorId")REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;
    ```

    > **Note**: If you do not provide a `--name`, Prisma CLI will prompt you for a name.

    Your Prisma schema is now in sync with your database schema and you have initialized a migration history:

    ```
    migrations/
      └─ 20210313140442_init/
        └─ migration.sql
    ```

    > **Note**: The folder name will be different for you. Folder naming is in the format of YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_your_text_from_name_flag.

1.  Add additional fields to your schema:

    ```prisma highlight=3;add
    model User {
      id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
      jobTitle String // [!code ++]
      name     String
      posts    Post[]
    }
    ```

1.  Create the second migration:

    ```bash
    prisma migrate dev --name added_job_title
    ```

    ```sql no-copy
      -- AlterTable
    ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN     "jobTitle" TEXT NOT NULL;
    ```

    Your Prisma schema is once again in sync with your database schema, and your migration history contains two migrations:

    ```
    migrations/
      └─ 20210313140442_init/
        └─ migration.sql
      └─ 20210313140442_added_job_title/
        └─ migration.sql
    ```

You now have a migration history that you can [source control](/v6/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/migration-histories#committing-the-migration-history-to-source-control) and use to [deploy changes to test environments and production](/v6/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/development-and-production#production-and-testing-environments).

## Adding Prisma Migrate to an existing project

The steps involved in **adding Prisma Migrate to your existing project** are:

1. Introspect your database to update your Prisma schema
1. Create a baseline migration
1. Update your schema or migration to workaround features not supported by Prisma Schema Language
1. Apply the baseline migration
1. Commit the migration history and Prisma schema

### Introspect to create or update your Prisma schema

Make sure your Prisma schema is in sync with your database schema. This should already be true if you are using a previous version of Prisma Migrate.

1. Introspect the database to make sure that your Prisma schema is up-to-date:
   ```bash
   prisma db pull
   ```

### Create a baseline migration

Baselining is the process of initializing a migration history for a database that:

- Existed before you started using Prisma Migrate
- Contains data that must be maintained (like production), which means that the database cannot be reset

Baselining tells Prisma Migrate to assume that one or more migrations have **already been applied**. This prevents generated migrations from failing when they try to create tables and fields that already exist.

To create a baseline migration:

1. If you have a `prisma/migrations` folder, delete, move, rename, or archive this folder.
1. Run the following command to create a `migrations` directory inside with your preferred name. This example will use `0_init` for the migration name:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p prisma/migrations/0_init
   ```
   :::note
   The `0_` is important because Prisma Migrate applies migrations in a [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order). You can use a different value such as the current timestamp.
   ::::
1. Generate a migration and save it to a file using `prisma migrate diff`:
   ```bash no-lines
   npx prisma migrate diff \
   --from-empty \
   --to-schema prisma/schema.prisma \
   --script > prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql
   ```
1. Review the generated migration.

### Work around features not supported by Prisma Schema Language

To include [unsupported database features](/v6/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/unsupported-database-features) that already exist in the database, you must replace or modify the initial migration SQL:

1. Open the `migration.sql` file generated in the [Create a baseline migration](#create-a-baseline-migration) section.
1. Modify the generated SQL. For example:

- If the changes are minor, you can append additional custom SQL to the generated migration. The following example creates a partial index:

  ```sql
  /* Generated migration SQL */

  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tests_success_constraint ON posts (subject, target) -- [!code ++]
    WHERE success; -- [!code ++]
  ```

- If the changes are significant, it can be easier to replace the entire migration file with the result of a database dump ([`mysqldump`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html), [`pg_dump`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-pgdump.html)). When using `pg_dump` for this, you'll need to update the `search_path` as follows with this command: `SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false);`; otherwise you'll run into the following error: `The underlying table for model '_prisma_migrations' does not exist.`
  `    :::info
Note that the order of the tables matters when creating all of them at once, since foreign keys are created at the same step. Therefore, either re-order them or move constraint creation to the last step after all tables are created, so you won't face`can't create constraint` errors
  :::

### Apply the initial migrations

To apply your initial migration(s):

1. Run the following command against your database:

   ```npm
   npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 0_init
   ```

1. Review the database schema to ensure the migration leads to the desired end-state (for example, by comparing the schema to the production database).

The new migration history and the database schema should now be in sync with your Prisma schema.

### Commit the migration history and Prisma schema

Commit the following to source control:

- The entire migration history folder
- The `schema.prisma` file
