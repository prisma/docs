## Introduction

In this comprehensive vibe coding tutorial, you'll build a complete **Linktree clone SaaS** application from scratch using AI assistance. This guide teaches you how to leverage AI tools to rapidly develop a full-stack application with:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** — React framework for production
- **[Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm)** — Type-safe database access
- **[Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres)** — Serverless PostgreSQL database
- **[Clerk](https://clerk.com/)** — Authentication and user management

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working SaaS application where users can sign up, create their profile, and manage their personal link page — all built with AI-assisted development.

:::info[What is Vibe Coding?]

Vibe coding is a development approach where you collaborate with AI assistants to build applications. You describe what you want to build, and the AI helps generate the code while you guide the direction and make architectural decisions.

:::

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org) installed
- A [Clerk account](https://clerk.com) (free tier works)
- An AI coding assistant ([Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), etc.)
- Basic familiarity with React and TypeScript

:::note[Recommended AI Models]

For best results, we recommend using the latest AI models such as (minimum) Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, or GPT-4o. These models provide better code generation accuracy and understand complex architectural patterns.

:::

---

## 1. Set Up Your Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js application:

```npm
npx create-next-app@latest app-name
```

Once the setup is complete, you'll need to add **Prisma** and **Prisma Postgres** to your project. We've prepared a detailed prompt that handles the complete setup for you.

👉 **Find the setup prompt here:** [Next.js + Prisma Prompt](/v6/ai/prompts/nextjs)

**How to use it:**

1. Create a new file called `prompt.md` at the root of your project
2. Copy and paste the prompt content into this file
3. Ask your AI assistant to follow the instructions in this file

The AI will set up Prisma ORM, create your database connection, and configure everything automatically.

### Quick Check

Let's verify everything is working correctly:

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open Prisma Studio to view your seed data:
   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```

If both commands run without errors and you can see sample data in Prisma Studio, you're ready to continue!

:::tip[Good Practice: Commit Early and Often]

Throughout this tutorial, we'll commit our changes regularly. This makes it easy to track progress and roll back if something goes wrong.

Start by linking your project to GitHub:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup: Next.js app with Prisma"
```

:::

---

## 2. Set Up Authentication with Clerk

Now let's add user authentication using [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), which provides a complete authentication solution out of the box.

**Steps to follow:**

1. Go to [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) and create an account (if you don't have one)
2. Create a new application in your Clerk dashboard
3. Follow Clerk's official quickstart guide to integrate it with your Next.js app:

👉 **Clerk Next.js Quickstart:** [clerk.com/docs/nextjs/getting-started/quickstart](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/getting-started/quickstart)

The guide will walk you through installing the SDK, adding environment variables, and wrapping your app with the `ClerkProvider`.

Once complete, commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Clerk authentication setup"
```

---

## 3. Update Your Database Schema

Since we're building a Linktree clone, we need to update the database schema to support our specific data model. This includes:

- A `User` model with a unique `username` (for public profile URLs like `/username`)
- A `Link` model to store each user's links

Replace the contents of your `prisma/schema.prisma` file with the following:

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma"
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client"
  output   = "../app/generated/prisma"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
}

// Example User model for testing
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  username  String   @unique // Important for the public profile URL
  clerkId   String   @unique // Links to Clerk Auth
  name      String?
  links     Link[]
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Link {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  url       String
  userId    Int
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

Since we're changing the schema structure, we need to reset the database. The existing seed data was just for testing purposes, so it's safe to drop and recreate:

```npm
npx prisma db push --force-reset
```

This command:

- **Drops** the existing database tables
- **Creates** new tables based on your updated schema

:::warning[Use with Caution]

The `--force-reset` flag deletes all existing data. This is fine during prototyping, but never use it on a production database! Once your schema is stable, switch to `prisma migrate dev` for proper migration tracking.

:::

### Quick Check

Open Prisma Studio to verify the new schema is applied:

```npm
npm run db:studio
```

You should see the updated `User` and `Link` tables (they'll be empty, which is expected).

**Commit your changes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update schema for Linktree clone"
```

---

## 4. Connect Clerk Users to Your Database

Here's the challenge: when a user signs in with Clerk, they exist in Clerk's system but **not** in your database. We need to bridge this gap.

Our approach: create a "Claim Username" flow where users pick their unique username (e.g., `yourapp.com/johndoe`) after signing in for the first time.

:::info[Use ASK Mode First]

When working with AI assistants, we recommend using **ASK mode** by default to review suggested changes before applying them. Only switch to AGENT mode once you're comfortable with the proposed code.

:::

### The Prompt

Copy and paste the following prompt into your AI assistant:

```markdown
Connect Clerk authentication to your Prisma database with a "Claim Username" flow.

**Goal:**

When a user signs in via Clerk, they don't automatically exist in YOUR database. Create a flow where:

1. Logged out → Show landing page with "Sign In" button
2. Logged in but no DB profile → Show "Claim Username" form
3. Has DB profile → Show dashboard

**User Model (already in schema):**

model User {
id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
email String @unique
username String @unique
clerkId String @unique
name String?
links Link[]
createdAt DateTime @default(now())
updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

**Files to create/update:**

1. `app/actions.ts` - Server Action with `claimUsername(formData)`
2. `app/page.tsx` - Three-state UI (logged out / claim username / dashboard)
3. `app/api/users/route.ts` - Update POST to accept `clerkId`, `email`, `username`, `name`

**Requirements:**

- Use `'use server'` directive in `app/actions.ts`
- Use `currentUser()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server` to get auth user
- Store `clerkId`, `email`, `username`, and `name` in User model
- Use `redirect("/")` after successful profile creation
- Handle username uniqueness (Prisma will throw if duplicate)

**Pattern:**

1. Server Action receives FormData, validates username (min 3 chars, alphanumeric + underscore)
2. Creates User in Prisma with Clerk's `user.id` as `clerkId`
3. Page.tsx checks: `currentUser()` → then `prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { clerkId } })`
4. Render different UI based on auth state and DB state

**Keep it simple:**

- No middleware file needed
- No webhook sync (user creates profile manually)
- Basic validation (username length >= 3)
- Errors just throw (no fancy error UI for MVP)
```

After the AI generates the code, you may see TypeScript errors. This is because the Prisma Client needs to be regenerated to reflect the schema changes:

```npm
npx prisma generate
```

### Quick Check

Test the complete flow:

1. Stop your dev server and restart it
2. Open your app in the browser
3. Sign up as a new user through Clerk
4. You should see the "Claim Username" form
5. Enter a username and submit
6. Verify the user appears in Prisma Studio (`npm run db:studio`)

If everything works, commit your changes!

---

## 5. Upgrade the UI Design

Let's give our app a more polished, friendly look inspired by platforms like Buy Me a Coffee.

👉 [Visit Buy Me a Coffee for design inspiration](https://buymeacoffee.com/)

Copy and paste this prompt to your AI assistant:

```markdown
Design a minimal, friendly UI inspired by Buy Me a Coffee.

**Theme:**

- Force light mode only (no dark mode switching)
- Clean white background (#FFFFFF)
- Black text (#000000) for headings
- Gray (#6B7280) for secondary text
- Bright yellow (#FFDD00) for CTA buttons
- Light gray (#F7F7F7) for cards/sections
- Subtle borders (#E5E5E5)

**Typography & Spacing:**

- Large, bold headlines (text-5xl or bigger)
- Generous whitespace and padding
- Rounded corners everywhere (rounded-full for buttons, rounded-xl for cards)

**Buttons:**

- Primary: Yellow background, black text, rounded-full, font-semibold
- Secondary: White background, border, rounded-full

**Overall feel:**

- Friendly, approachable, not corporate
- Minimal — only essential elements
- Mobile-first with good touch targets (py-4, px-8 on buttons)
- One unified canvas — background applies to the entire page (body), with white cards floating on top. No separate section backgrounds.

Use Tailwind CSS. Keep it simple.
```

### Quick Check

After the AI applies the changes:

1. Refresh your app and browse through all pages
2. Verify the design has updated but **no functionality has changed**
3. Test the sign-in flow and username claim process

Once verified, commit the changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update UI design"
```

---

## 6. Build Link Management (Add & Delete)

Now let's add the core functionality: managing links! Users should be able to add new links and delete existing ones from their dashboard.

Copy and paste this prompt:

```markdown
Build a simple dashboard for managing links using Next.js App Router and Server Actions.

**Requirements:**

- Server Component page that fetches user data from database
- "Add Link" form with Title and URL inputs
- List of existing links with Delete button
- Use Server Actions (no API routes) for create/delete operations
- Use `revalidatePath("/")` after mutations to refresh the page

**Pattern:**

1. Create server actions in `actions.ts` with `'use server'` directive
2. Pass actions directly to form `action` prop
3. Keep page.tsx as a Server Component (no 'use client')
4. Use hidden inputs for IDs (e.g., `<input type="hidden" name="linkId" value={id} />`)

**Keep it simple:**

- No loading states
- No client components
- No confirmation dialogs
- Just forms + server actions + revalidation

This is the MVP pattern for CRUD with Next.js App Router.
```

### Quick Check

Test the link management:

1. Add a new link with a title and URL
2. Verify it appears in your dashboard
3. Delete the link
4. Verify it's removed

Both operations should work instantly without page navigation.

---

## 7. Create Public Profile Pages

This is the heart of a Linktree clone: public profile pages that anyone can visit at `/username`.

Copy and paste this prompt:

```markdown
Build a public profile page at /[username] using Next.js App Router dynamic routes.

**Requirements:**

- Create `app/[username]/page.tsx` as a Server Component
- Fetch user + links from database by username (from URL params)
- Return 404 if user not found (use `notFound()` from next/navigation)
- Display: avatar (first letter), username, name, and list of links
- Links open in new tab with `target="_blank"`
- Add a small "Create your own" link at the bottom

**Pattern:**

1. Get params: `const { username } = await params`
2. Query database with `findUnique({ where: { username } })`
3. If no user: call `notFound()`
4. Render profile with links as clickable buttons

**Keep it simple:**

- No auth required (it's a public page)
- Pure Server Component (no 'use client')
- Basic styling with hover effects

This is the core "Linktree" feature — anyone can visit /username to see the links.
```

### Quick Check

Test your public profile:

1. Navigate to `localhost:3000/your-username` (replace with your actual username)
2. Verify your profile and links display correctly
3. Click a link and confirm it opens in a new tab

---

## 8. Add a "Copy Link" Button

Make it easy for users to share their profile URL with a one-click copy button.

Copy and paste this prompt:

```markdown
**Requirements:**

- Create a Client Component (`'use client'`) for the button
- Use `navigator.clipboard.writeText(url)` to copy
- Show "Copied!" feedback for 2 seconds after clicking
- Use `useState` to toggle the button text

**Pattern:**

1. Create `app/components/copy-button.tsx` with 'use client'
2. Accept `url` as a prop
3. On click: copy to clipboard, set `copied` to true
4. Use `setTimeout` to reset after 2 seconds
5. Import and use in your Server Component page

**Keep it simple:**

- One small client component
- No toast libraries
- Just inline text feedback ("Copy link" → "Copied!")
```

### Quick Check

1. Find the "Copy link" button on your dashboard
2. Click it and verify it shows "Copied!"
3. Paste somewhere to confirm the URL was copied correctly

---

## 9. Create a Custom 404 Page

When someone visits a non-existent username, they should see a friendly error page instead of a generic 404.

Copy and paste this prompt:

```markdown
Create a custom 404 page for Next.js App Router.

**Requirements:**

- Create `app/not-found.tsx` (Server Component)
- Display: 404 heading, friendly message, "Go home" button
- Match your app's design (colors, fonts, spacing)

**Pattern:**

- Next.js automatically uses `not-found.tsx` when `notFound()` is called
- Or when a route doesn't exist
- No configuration needed — just create the file

**Keep it simple:**

- Static page, no data fetching
- One heading, one message, one link
- Same styling as rest of the app
```

### Quick Check

Test the 404 page by visiting a random URL like `/this-user-does-not-exist`. You should see your custom 404 page with a link back to the homepage.

---

## 10. Add a Custom Background

Let's make the app more visually distinctive with a custom background pattern.

**First**, either:

- Download a background SVG pattern you like, or
- Create your own using tools like [SVG Backgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/) or [Hero Patterns](https://heropatterns.com/)

**Then**, save it as `background.svg` in your `public/` folder.

Copy and paste this prompt:

````markdown
Add a custom SVG background to my app.

**Requirements:**

- The svg file is in the `public/` folder (e.g., `public/background.svg`)
- Apply it as a fixed, full-cover background on the body

**Pattern:**
In `globals.css`, update the body:

```css
body {
  background: var(--background) url("/background.svg") center/cover no-repeat fixed;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

**Key properties:**

- `center/cover` — centers and scales to fill
- `no-repeat` — prevents tiling
- `fixed` — background stays in place when scrolling

Files in `public/` are served at the root URL, so `/background.svg` works.
````

### Quick Check

1. Refresh your app
2. Verify the background appears on **all pages** (homepage, dashboard, profile pages, 404)
3. If the background doesn't appear everywhere, ask your AI to fix it

Commit your changes once it's working correctly.

---

## 11. Add Glassmorphism Card Containers

Create visual depth by adding semi-transparent card containers that "float" over the background.

Copy and paste this prompt:

````markdown
Add a reusable card container class to create visual separation from the background.

**Requirements:**

- Create a `.card` class in `globals.css`
- Apply glassmorphism: semi-transparent white + blur
- Use on all main content areas (landing, forms, dashboard, profile pages)

**Pattern:**
In `globals.css`, add:

```css
.card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border-radius: 1.5rem;
  padding: 2rem;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
}
```

**Usage:**
Wrap content sections with `<div className="card">...</div>`

For public profile pages (/[username]):
Wrap the entire profile (avatar, name, username, and links list) in a single .card container
This creates a Linktree-style floating card effect
Footer/attribution links stay outside the card

Hero section:
Add a soft radial glow behind the content (large blurred white circle, blur-3xl, 50% opacity)
No visible container edges — just organic, fading brightness
Content floats freely over the glow

**Result:**

- Content "lifts" off the background
- Subtle blur creates depth
- Consistent UI across all pages
````

---

## 12. Display Clerk Profile Images

If users sign in with Google or another OAuth provider, Clerk stores their profile photo. Let's display it on public profiles!

Copy and paste this prompt:

````markdown
On the public profile page (`/[username]`), display the user's Clerk profile image (Google photo, etc.) instead of the initial letter avatar.

**Pattern:**

```typescript
// Fetch Clerk user to get profile image
const client = await clerkClient();
const clerkUser = await client.users.getUser(user.clerkId);
```

**Display:**

- Use a plain `<img>` tag (not Next.js Image component)
- If `clerkUser.imageUrl` exists, show the image
- Otherwise fallback to the yellow initial avatar

**Keep it simple:**

- No try/catch — let errors bubble up
- No next.config changes needed
- No database schema changes needed
````

### Quick Check

Visit your public profile page and verify your profile image (from Google, GitHub, etc.) is displayed instead of the initial letter avatar.

---

## 13. Add Icons with Lucide

Small icons can significantly improve UI clarity. Let's add some using Lucide React.

Copy and paste this prompt:

```markdown
Add Lucide React icons to improve the UI.

First install: npm install lucide-react

Add icons to these elements:

- View button: ExternalLink icon
- Delete button: Trash2 icon (replace text with icon)
- Empty links state: Link icon

Import icons from 'lucide-react' and use with size prop (e.g., size={18}).

Keep buttons minimal — only add icons where they improve clarity.
```

### Quick Check

Browse through your app and verify the icons appear on:

- The view/external link buttons
- The delete buttons
- The empty state when no links exist

---

## 14. Deploy to Vercel

Time to ship! Let's deploy your app to Vercel.

:::warning[Important Steps]

Follow these steps carefully to avoid deployment errors.

:::

### Step 1: Configure Prisma for Production

Add a `postinstall` script to ensure Prisma Client is generated during deployment.

Add this to your `package.json` scripts section:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

📖 **Reference:** [Deploy to Vercel - Build Configuration](/v6/orm/prisma-client/deployment/serverless/deploy-to-vercel#build-configuration)

### Step 2: Clean Up Development Files

Delete the `scripts/` folder if it exists. This folder was auto-generated during initial setup for seed data, you don't need it in production.

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub (if you haven't already)
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your repository
3. **Important:** Add all your environment variables in Vercel's dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`

### Step 4: Update the App URL

After your first deployment:

1. Copy your production URL from Vercel (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
2. Add a new environment variable in Vercel:
   ```text
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
   ```
3. Redeploy to apply the change

:::warning[Don't Forget This Step]

If you skip setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, features like the "Copy Link" button will copy `localhost` URLs instead of your production URL.

:::

### Final Check

Test your deployed app thoroughly:

- [ ] Sign up flow works
- [ ] Username claiming works
- [ ] Adding/deleting links works
- [ ] Public profile pages load correctly
- [ ] Copy link copies the correct production URL
- [ ] 404 page displays for non-existent usernames

**Congratulations! Your Linktree clone is live! 🎉**
