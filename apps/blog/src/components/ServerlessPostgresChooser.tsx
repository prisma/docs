      why: "The bundle is auth, storage, realtime and edge functions around Postgres, from $25/month with a Micro instance covered by credits.",

      title: "PlanetScale",
      why: "Always-on dedicated clusters from $5/month (single node) or $50/month on Metal, prorated to the millisecond. At sustained load, paying for every hour beats metering.",

      id: "idle-neon",
      title: "Neon",
      why: "Scale-to-zero was built for exactly this: idle time costs storage only, and a few hundred milliseconds of wake-up is invisible to a cron job.",

      caveat:
        "Prisma publishes this guide, so hold this recommendation to the same skepticism as the rest. Past roughly 24M queries a month the guide's own worked example shows an always-on Neon compute becomes cheaper.",
