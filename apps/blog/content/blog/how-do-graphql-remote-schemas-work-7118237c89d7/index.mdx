  Understanding GraphQL schema stitching (Part I)
---

In this article, we want to understand how we can use _any_ existing GraphQL API and expose it through our own server. In that setup, our server simply _forwards_ the GraphQL queries and mutations it receives to the underlying GraphQL API. The component responsible for forwarding these operations is called a _remote (executable) schema_.

Remote schemas are the foundation for a set of tools and techniques referred to as _schema stitching_, a brand new topic in the GraphQL community. In the following articles, we’ll discuss the different approaches to schemas stitching in more detail.

## Recap: GraphQL Schemas

In a [previous article](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e), we already covered the basic mechanics and inner workings of the GraphQL schema. Let’s do a quick recap!

Before we begin, it’s important to disambiguate the term _GraphQL schema_, since it can mean a couple of things. For the context of this article, we’ll mostly use the term to refer to an instance of the [`GraphQLSchema`](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema) class, which is provided by the [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) reference implementation and used as the foundation for GraphQL servers written in Node.js.

The schema is made up of two major components:

- **Schema definition**: This part is usually written in the GraphQL [Schema Definition Language](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51) (SDL) and describes the capabilities of the API in an _abstract_ way, so there’s not yet an actual _implementation_. In essence, the schema definition specifies what kinds of operations (queries, mutations, subscriptions) the server will accept. Note that for a schema definition to be valid it needs to contain the `Query` type — and optionally the `Mutation` and/or `Subscription` type. (When referring to a schema definition in code, corresponding variables are typically called `typeDefs`.)
- **Resolvers**: Here is where the schema definition _comes to life_ and receives its actual _behaviour_. Resolvers _implement_ the API that’s specified by the schema definition. (For more info, refer to the [last article](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e).)

> When a schema has a schema definition as well as resolver functions, we also refer to it as an **executable schema**. Note that an instance of `GraphQLSchema` is not necessarily executable — it can be the case that it only contains a schema definition but doesn’t have any resolvers attached.

Here is what a simple example looks like, using the `makeExecutableSchema` function from [`graphql-tools`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools):

```js
const { makeExecutableSchema } = require('graphql-tools')

// SCHEMA DEFINITION
const typeDefs = `
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
}`

// RESOLVERS
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: (root, args, context, info) => {
      return fetchUserById(args.id)
    },
  },
}

// (EXECUTABLE) SCHEMA
const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
})
```
`typeDefs` contains the schema definition, including the required `Query` and a simple `User` type. `resolvers` is an object containing the implementation for the `user` field defined on the `Query` type.

`makeExecutableSchema` now maps the fields from the SDL types in the schema definition to the corresponding functions defined in the `resolvers` object. It returns an instance of `GraphQLSchema` which we can now use to [_execute_](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e) actual GraphQL queries, for example using the [`graphql`](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/graphql/#graphql) function from GraphQL.js:

```js
... // other imports
const { graphql } = require('graphql')

const schema = ... // the schema from above
const query = `
  query {
    user(id: "abc") {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`

graphql(schema, query)
  .then(result => console.log(result))
```
Because the `graphql` function is able to _execute_ a query against an instance of `GraphQLSchema`, it’s also referred to as a _GraphQL (execution) engine_.

A GraphQL execution engine is a program (or function) that, given an executable schema and a query (or mutation), produces a valid response. Therefore, its main responsibility is to orchestrate the invocations of the resolver functions in the executable schema and properly package up the response data, [according to the GraphQL specification](https://spec.graphql.org/October2016/#sec-Response).

With that knowledge, let’s dive into how we can create an executable instance of `GraphQLSchema` based on an existing GraphQL API.

## Introspecting GraphQL APIs

One handy property of GraphQL APIs is that they allow for [_introspection_](http://graphql.org/learn/introspection/). This means you can extract the _schema definition_ of any GraphQL API by sending a so-called _introspection query_.

Considering the example from above, you could use the following query to extract all the types and their fields from a schema:

```graphql
query {
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      fields {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This would return the following JSON data:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "__schema": {
      "types": [
        {
          "name": "Query",
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "user"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "User",
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "id"
            },
            {
              "name": "name"
            }
          ]
        }
        // ... some more metadata
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
As you can see, the information in this JSON object is equivalent to our SDL-based schema definition from above (actually it’s not 100% equivalent as we haven’t asked for the _arguments_ on the fields, but we could simply extend the introspection query from above to include these as well).

## Creating a remote schema

With the ability to introspect the schema of an existing GraphQL API, we can now simply create a new `GraphQLSchema` instance whose schema definition is identical to the existing one. That’s exactly the idea of [`makeRemoteExecutableSchema`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/remote-schemas.html#makeRemoteExecutableSchema) from `graphql-tools`.

![](/blog/how-do-graphql-remote-schemas-work-7118237c89d7/imgs/1*nmcFbnUg7ooxjlZ8z-GLQA.png)

`makeRemoteExecutableSchema` receives two arguments:

- A _schema definition_ (which you can obtain using an introspection query seen above). Note that it’s considered best practice to download the schema definition already at development time and upload it to your server as a `.graphql`-file rather than sending an introspection query at runtime (which results in a big performance overhead).
- A [_Link_](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/) that is connected to the GraphQL API to be proxied. In essence, this Link is a component that can forward queries and mutations to the existing GraphQL API — so it needs to know its (HTTP) endpoint.

The [implementation](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools/blob/master/src/stitching/makeRemoteExecutableSchema.ts#L39) of `makeRemoteExecutableSchema` is fairly straightforward from here. The schema definition is used as the foundation for the new schema. But what about the resolvers, where do they come from?

Obviously, we can’t _download_ the resolvers in the same way we download the schema definition — there is no introspection query for resolvers. However, we can create _new_ resolvers that are using the mentioned Link component to simply _forward_ any incoming queries or mutations to the underlying GraphQL API.

Enough palaver, let’s see some code! Here is an example which is based on a Graphcool CRUD API for a type called `User` in order to create a remote schema which is then exposed through a dedicated server (using [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-yoga)):

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch')
const { makeRemoteExecutableSchema, introspectSchema } = require('graphql-tools')
const { GraphQLServer } = require('graphql-yoga')
const { createHttpLink } = require('apollo-link-http')

const { DATABASE_SERVICE_ID } = require('./services')

async function run() {
  // 1. Create Apollo Link that's connected to the underlying GraphQL API
  const makeDatabaseServiceLink = () =>
    createHttpLink({
      uri: `https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/${DATABASE_SERVICE_ID}`,
      fetch,
    })

  // 2. Retrieve schema definition of the underlying GraphQL API
  const databaseServiceSchemaDefinition = await introspectSchema(makeDatabaseServiceLink())

  // 3. Create the executable schema based on schema definition and Apollo Link
  const databaseServiceExecutableSchema = makeRemoteExecutableSchema({
    schema: databaseServiceSchemaDefinition,
    link: makeDatabaseServiceLink(),
  })

  // 4. Create and start proxy server based on the executable schema
  const server = new GraphQLServer({ schema: databaseServiceExecutableSchema })
  server.start(() => console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000'))
}

run()
```

For context, the CRUD API for the User type looks somewhat similar to this (the full version can be found [here](https://github.com/nikolasburk/graphcool-remote-schema/blob/master/user-db/database.graphql)):

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}

type Query {
  allUsers: [User!]!
  User(id: ID!): User
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!): User
  updateUser(id: ID!, name: String): User
  deleteUser(id: ID!): User
}
```
## Remote schemas under the hood

Let’s investigate what `databaseServiceSchemaDefinition` and `databaseServiceExecutableSchema` from the above example look like under the covers.

### Inspecting GraphQL schemas

The first thing to note is that both of them are instances of `GraphQLSchema`. However, the `databaseServiceSchemaDefinition` contains only the schema definition, while databaseServiceExecutableSchema is actually an executable schema — meaning it does have resolver functions attached to its types’ fields.

Using the chrome debugger, we can reveal the databaseServiceSchemaDefinition is a JavaScript object looking as follows:

![A non-executable instance of GraphQLSchema](/blog/how-do-graphql-remote-schemas-work-7118237c89d7/imgs/1*o57PeaoF5PVrON-FhR8QTA.png)_A non-executable instance of GraphQLSchema_

The blue rectangle shows the [`Query`](https://github.com/nikolasburk/graphcool-remote-schema/blob/master/user-db/database.graphql#L29) type with its properties. As expected, it has a field called `allUsers` (among others). However, in this schema instance there are no resolvers attached to the `Query`'s fields— so it’s not executable.

Let’s also take a look at the `databaseServiceExecutableSchema`:

![Executable Schema = Schema definition + Resolvers](/blog/how-do-graphql-remote-schemas-work-7118237c89d7/imgs/1*KQ620d8vVrnl4vCYyqkWOA.png)_Executable Schema = Schema definition + Resolvers_

This screenshot looks very similar to the one we just saw — except that the `allUsers` field now has this `resolve` function attached to it. (This is also the case for the other fields on the [`Query`](https://github.com/nikolasburk/graphcool-remote-schema/blob/master/user-db/database.graphql#L29) type (`User`, `node`, `user` and `_allUsersMeta`), but not visible in the screenshot.)

We can go one step further and actually take a look at the implementation of the `resolve` function (note that this code was dynamically generated by `makeRemoteExecutableSchema`):

```js
function (root, args, context, info) {
  return __awaiter(_this, void 0, void 0, function () {
    var fragments, document, result;
    return __generator(this, function (_a) {
      switch (_a.label) {
        case 0:
          fragments = Object.keys(info.fragments).map(function (fragment) { return info.fragments[fragment]; });
          document = {
            kind: graphql_1.Kind.DOCUMENT,
            definitions: [info.operation].concat(fragments),
          };
          return [4 /*yield*/, fetcher({
            query: graphql_2.print(document),
            variables: info.variableValues,
            context: { graphqlContext: context },
          })];
        case 1:
          result = _a.sent();
          return [2 /*return*/, errors_1.checkResultAndHandleErrors(result, info)];
      }
    });
  });
}
```
Line 12–16 is what’s interesting to us: a function called `fetcher` is invoked with three arguments: `query`, `variables` and `context`. The `fetcher` was generated based on the Link we provided earlier, it basically is a function that’s able to send a GraphQL operation to a specific endpoint (the one used to create the Link), which is exactly what it’s doing here. Notice that the actual GraphQL document that’s passed as the value for query in line 13 originates from the info argument passed into the resolver (see line 10). `info` contains the AST representation of the query .

### Non-root resolvers don’t make network calls

In the same way that we explored the resolver function for the `allUsers` root field above, we can also investigate what the resolvers for the fields on the `User` type look like. We therefore need to navigate into the `_typeMaps` property of the `databaseServiceExecutableSchema` where we find the `User` type with its fields:

![The User type has two fields: id and name (both have an attached resolver function)](/blog/how-do-graphql-remote-schemas-work-7118237c89d7/imgs/1*bz9k7dsElF5x_eqIfc_XWw.png)_The User type has two fields: id and name (both have an attached resolver function)_

Both fields (`id` and `name`) have a `resolve` function attached to them, here is their implementation that was generated by `makeRemoteExecutableSchema` (note that it’s identical for both fields):

```js
function (parent, args, context, info) {
    var responseKey = info.fieldNodes[0].alias
        ? info.fieldNodes[0].alias.value
        : info.fieldName;
    var errorResult = errors_1.getErrorsFromParent(parent, responseKey);
    if (errorResult.kind === 'OWN') {
        throw error_1.locatedError(errorResult.error.message, info.fieldNodes, graphql_1.responsePathAsArray(info.path));
    }
    else if (parent) {
        var result = parent[responseKey];
        // subscription result mapping
        if (!result && parent.data && parent.data[responseKey]) {
            result = parent.data[responseKey];
        }
        if (errorResult.errors) {
            result = errors_1.annotateWithChildrenErrors(result, errorResult.errors);
        }
        return result;
    }
    else {
        return null;
    }
}
```
Interestingly, this time the generated resolver does not use a `fetcher` function — in fact it doesn’t call out to the network at all. The result being returned is simply retrieved from the `parent` argument (line 10) that’s passed into the function.

### Tracing resolver data in remote schemas

The [tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing) data for resolvers of remote executable schemas also confirm this finding. In the following screenshot, we extended the previous schema definition with an `Article` and `Comment` type (each also connected to the `existingUser`) so we can send a more deeply nested query.

![[GraphQL Playgrounds](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) support displaying [tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing) data for resolvers out-of-the-box (bottom right)](/blog/how-do-graphql-remote-schemas-work-7118237c89d7/imgs/1*SwVWiWOCRnyCCP80lKoXjw.png)_[GraphQL Playgrounds](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) support displaying [tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing) data for resolvers out-of-the-box (bottom right)_

It’s very apparent from the tracing data that only the root resolver (for the allUsers field) takes notable time (167 milliseconds). All remaining resolvers responsible for returning data for non-root fields only take a few microseconds to be executed. This can be explained with the observation we made earlier that root resolvers use the `fetcher` to forward the received query while all non-root resolvers simple return their data based on the incoming `parent` argument.

## Resolver strategies

When implementing the resolver functions for a schema definition, there are multiple ways how to this can be approached.

### Standard pattern: Type level resolving

Consider the following schema definition:

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  articles: [Article!]!
}

type Article {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  published: Boolean!
  author: User!
}
```
Based on the `Query` type, it is possible to send the following query to the API:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "abc") {
    articles {
      title
    }
  }
}
```
How would the corresponding resolvers typically be implemented? A standard approach for this looks as follows (assume functions starting with `fetch` in this code are loading resources from a database):

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users: () => fetchAllUsers(), // load from database,
    user: (root, args) => fetchUserById(args.id), // load from database
  },
  User: {
    id: parent => parent.id,
    name: parent => parent.name,
    articles: parent => fetchArticlesForUser(parent.id), // load from database
  },
  Article: {
    id: parent => parent.id,
    title: parent => parent.title,
    author: parent => fetchAuthorForArticle(parent.id), // load from database
  },
}
```
With this approach, we’re resolving on a _type level_. This means that the actual object for a specific query (e.g. a particular `Article`) is fetched _before_ any resolvers of the `Article` type are called.

Consider the resolver invocations for the query above:

1. The `Query.user` resolver is called and loads a specific `User` object from the database. Notice that it will load all scalar fields of the `User` object, including `id` and `name` even though these have not been requested in the query. It does not load anything for `articles` yet though — this is what’s happening in the next step.
1. Next, the `User.articles` resolver is invoked. Notice that the input argument `parent` is the return value from the previous resolver, so it’s a full `User` object which allows the resolver to access the `User`’s `id` to load the `Article` objects for it.

> If you have trouble following this example, make sure to read the [last article](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e) on GraphQL schemas.

### Remote executable schemas use a multi-level resolver approach

Let’s now think about the remote schema example and its resolvers again. We learned that when executing a query using a remote executable schema, the datasource is only hit _once_, in the root resolver (where we found the `fetcher` – see screenshot above). All other resolvers only return the canonical result based on the incoming `parent` argument (which is a subpart of the result of the initial root resolver invocation).

But how does that work? It seems that the root resolver fetches all needed data in a single resolver — but isn’t this super inefficient? Well, it indeed would be very inefficient, if we always load all object fields _including_ all relational data. So how can we only load the data specified in the incoming query?

This is why the root resolver of remote executable schemas makes use of the available info argument which contains the query information. By looking at the selection set of the actual query, the resolver doesn’t have to load all fields of an object but instead only loads the fields it needs. This “trick” is what makes it still efficient to load all data in a single resolver.

## Summary

In this article, we learned how to create a _proxy_ for any existing GraphQL API using [`makeRemoteExecutableSchema`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/remote-schemas.html#makeRemoteExecutableSchema) from [`graphql-tools`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools). This proxy is called a _remote executable schema_ and running on your own server. It simply forwards any queries it receives to the underlying GraphQL API.

We also saw that this remote executable schema is implemented using a _multi-level_ resolver where nested data is fetched a single time by the first resolver rather than multiple times on a type level.

There is still a lot to discover about remote schemas: How does this relate to schema stitching? How does this work with GraphQL subscriptions? What happens to my `context` object? Let us know in the comments what you’d like to learn next! 👋
