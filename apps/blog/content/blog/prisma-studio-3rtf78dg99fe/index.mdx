## The need for a visual data browser

Databases are often times black boxes with no discernible interface other than SQL queries. This can be inconvenient when building applications. Developers need to be able to _quickly_ verify the application is reading and writing data correctly, and adding a couple of rows of data to the database should be _as easy as editing a spreadsheet_.

We realized that developers building applications using Prisma would welcome having an intuitive interface providing the productivity and confidence benefits of Prisma Client: an **easy access to your application's data**, without the need to deal with SQL.

## What can Studio do?

In the first generally available version, Prisma Studio provides a straightforward, grid-based view of the data present in the database defined in your Prisma project, no matter if it uses SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL under the hood.

It comes with some exciting features and qualities:

## Try it out with your existing database

Even if you're not using Prisma in your project yet, you can connect Prisma Studio to your database and benefit from Studio's modern interface. Get started in 4 steps:

### 1. Setup Prisma

First, install the [Prisma CLI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/tools/prisma-cli) in your project:


```
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
```


Now you can initialize a new Prisma project:


```
npx prisma init
```


This creates a new directory called `prisma` with an empty [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema) file and a `.env` file for your databse connection URL.

### 2. Connect your database

Next, you need to connect your database by providing your [connection URL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/connection-urls) as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in the `.env` file. Here are a few examples for what you connection URL might look like depending on the database you use:


```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
```
```prisma
DATABASE_URL="mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/mydb"
```
```prisma
DATABASE_URL="file:./mydb.db"
```
```prisma
DATABASE_URL=sqlserver://localhost:1433;database=prisma-demo;user=SA;password=Pr1sm4_Pr1sm4;trustServerCertificate=true;encrypt=true
```


Note that if you're not using PostgreSQL, you also need to adjust the `provider` field in the `datasource` block to specify your database:



```prisma
datasource db {
  url =       env("DATABASE_URL")
  provider = "postgresql"
}
```
```prisma
datasource db {
  url =       env("DATABASE_URL")
  provider = "mysql"
}
```
```prisma
datasource db {
  url =       env("DATABASE_URL")
  provider = "sqlite"
}
```
```prisma
datasource db {
  url =       env("DATABASE_URL")
  provider = "sqlserver"
}
```


### 3. Introspect your database

With your database connection URL, you can introspect your database. Note that this will populate your [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema) file with Prisma models that represent your database schema:


```
npx prisma introspect
```


### 4. Launch Prisma Studio 🚀

That's it. You can now launch Prisma Studio to view and edit the data in your database:


```
npx prisma studio
```
