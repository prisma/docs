  Discover how [Bucket](https://bucket.co/), a fast-growing feature management platform, uses Prisma ORM to simplify complex relational queries and accelerate feature releases. Learn how their lean team delivers high-quality features faster while managing evolving database needs with ease.

## Company Overview

[Bucket](http://Bucket.co) is feature management for product engineering teams. Founded in Copenhagen three years ago, Bucket integrates feature flags, with user feedback, and adoption metrics, so teams can perfect features faster.

## Challenge

As a fast-growing startup with only eight employees, Bucket needed tools that help them move quickly without sacrificing quality. One of their biggest challenges was managing complex database relationships. The team wanted an easy way to write relational database queries without slowing down their development process or compromising type safety.

## Why Bucket Chose Prisma

Bucket chose Prisma ORM to simplify how their Node.js services interact with PostgreSQL databases on Google Cloud. Prisma makes it easy to perform complex database operations, generates type-safe database clients automatically, and handles schema migrations smoothly, so it was a perfect match.

Prisma makes database management incredibly easy. For example, when we needed to implement OAuth, which involved creating multiple new database tables, we just defined them in our Prisma schema, ran a migration, and everything was ready. Prisma’s built-in type safety helps us avoid mistakes that happen with manual setups.

## Benefits of Prisma

Bucket immediately saw improvements after adopting Prisma, including:

- **Faster Development:** Schema-based migrations help the team quickly experiment with new database structures without the hassle of manual adjustments.

- **Simplified Relational Queries:** Prisma’s automatically generated, type-safe client simplified managing complex database relationships. The straightforward syntax for relational queries, especially using Prisma’s `include` and `select`, allowed the Bucket.co team to create powerful queries quickly and with confidence. Bucket’s co-founder, Ron Cohen, highlights,

We rely on Prisma heavily for relational queries. It’s so intuitive and makes complex queries easy to manage, allowing us to build advanced data retrieval patterns with minimal effort.

- **Smooth Collaboration:** Having a single, clear database schema helps team members stay aligned, making it easier to collaborate on complex database structures without confusion or mistakes.

## Future Plans
Bucket is excited about upcoming improvements to Prisma, particularly the shift to fully [TypeScript-based client generation](https://www.prisma.io/blog/from-rust-to-typescript-a-new-chapter-for-prisma-orm) and performance enhancements for better serverless and edge computing support.

## Impact of Prisma
Bucket’s decision to use Prisma has made it easier to deliver new features quickly and reliably with a small team. Prisma’s intuitive handling of relational database queries has been especially impactful, allowing Bucket to stay agile, productive, and keep their high quality bar.
