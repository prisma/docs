## Recap: Code-first development with GraphQL Nexus

In the last article, we introduced [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/docs/getting-started), a GraphQL library that enables code-first development for TypeScript and JavaScript. With Nexus, the GraphQL schema is defined and implemented _programmatically_. It therefore follows proven approaches of GraphQL servers in other languages, such as [`sangria-graphql`](https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria) (Scala), [`graphlq-ruby`](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) or [`graphene`](https://graphene-python.org/) (Python).

Today's article is about connecting your Nexus-based GraphQL server to a database, using the Prisma client as well as the new [`nexus-prisma`](https://github.com/prisma/nexus-prisma) plugin. We'll later walk you through a practical example of building a GraphQL API for a blogging app from scratch.

> `nexus-prisma` works with PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB. **Find the docs for it [here](https://nexus.js.org/docs/nexus-prisma)**.

## TLDR: Benefits of the `nexus-prisma` plugin

- CRUD operations for your Prisma models in GraphQL
- Customize your Prisma models, e.g. _hide certain fields_ or _add computed fields_
- Full type-safety: Coherent set of types for GraphQL schema and database
- Compatible with the GraphQL ecosystem (e.g. `apollo-server`, `graphql-yoga`, ...)

## Understanding the `nexus-prisma` workflow

### The Prisma client as an ORM replacement

If you haven't worked with Prisma before, here's a quick rundown of how it works:

1. Define your datamodel or let Prisma introspect your existing database
1. Generate your Prisma client, i.e. a type-safe database client
1. Use the Prisma client to access your database in an application (e.g. a GraphQL API)

### The `nexus-prisma` plugin under the hood

When adding `nexus-prisma` to the mix, there's another step: invoking the `nexus-prisma-generate` codegen CLI. It generates the building blocks of a full-blown GraphQL CRUD API for your Prisma models, e.g. for a **`User`** model it includes:

- **Queries**
  - **`user(...): User!`**: Fetches a single record
  - **`users(...): [User!]!`**: Fetches a list of records
  - **`usersConnection(...): UserConnection!`**: [Relay connections](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/#complete-connection-model) & aggregations
- **Mutations**
  - **`createUser(...): User!`**: Creates a new record
  - **`updateUser(...): User`**: Updates a record
  - **`deleteUser(...): User`**: Deletes a record
  - **`updatesManyUsers(...): BatchPayload!`**: Updates many records in bulk
  - **`deleteManyUsers(...): BatchPayload!`**: Deletes many records in bulk
- [**GraphQL input types**](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/mutations-and-input-types/)
  - **`UserCreateInput`**: Wraps all fields of the record
  - **`UserUpdateInput`**: Wraps all fields of the record
  - **`UserWhereInput`**: Provides filters for all fields of the record
  - **`UserWhereUniqueInput`**: Provides filters for unique fields of the record
  - **`UserUpdateManyMutationInput`**: Wraps fields that can be updated in bulk
  - **`UserOrderByInput`**: Specifies ascending or descending orders by field

> `UserCreateInput` and `UserUpdateInput` differ in the way relation fields are treated.

When writing your GraphQL server code with `nexus` and `nexus-prisma`, you build upon these operations by exposing and customizing them to your own API needs:

![Writing GraphQL server code with nexus and nexus-prisma](/blog/using-graphql-nexus-with-a-database-pmyl3660ncst/imgs/dbEMHd5.png)

After having generated the CRUD building blocks, you can use `prismaObjectType` from `nexus-prisma` to start exposing (and customizing) them. The following code snippets depict an implementation that provides a GraphQL API for a TODO-list app based on Prisma and `nexus-prisma`:



```graphql
type Todo {
  id: ID! @unique
  title: String!
  done: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
}
```
```ts
import { prismaObjectType } from 'nexus-prisma'
import { idArg } from 'nexus-prisma'

// Expose the full "Query" building block
const Query = prismaObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  definition: t => t.prismaFields(['*'])
})

// Customize the "Mutation" building block
const Mutation = prismaObjectType({
  name: 'Mutation',
  definition(t) {
    // Keep only the `createTodo` mutation
    t.prismaFields(['createTodo'])

    // Add a custom `markAsDone` mutation
    t.field('markAsDone', {
      args: { id: idArg() },
      nullable: true,
      resolve: (_, { id }, ctx) {
        return ctx.prisma.updateTodo({
          where: { id },
          data: { done: true }
        })
      }
    })
  }
})

const schema = makePrismaSchema({
  types: [Query, Mutation],

  // More config stuff, e.g. where to put the generated SDL
})

// Feed the `schema` into your GraphQL server, e.g. `apollo-server, `graphql-yoga`
```
```graphql
# The fully exposed "Query" building block
type Query {
  todo(where: TodoWhereUniqueInput!): Todo
  todoes(
    after: String
    before: String
    first: Int
    last: Int
    orderBy: TodoOrderByInput
    skip: Int
    where: TodoWhereInput
  ): [Todo!]!
  todoesConnection(
    after: String
    before: String
    first: Int
    last: Int
    orderBy: TodoOrderByInput
    skip: Int
    where: TodoWhereInput
  ): TodoConnection!
}

# The customized "Mutation" building block
type Mutation {
  createTodo(data: TodoCreateInput!): Todo!
  markAsDone(id: ID): Todo
}

# The Prisma model
type Todo {
  done: Boolean!
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}

# More of the generated building blocks:
# e.g. `TodoWhereUniqueInput`, `TodoCreateInput`, `TodoConnection`, ...
```


We're applying `prismaObjectType` to `Query` and `Mutation`. For `Query`, we're keeping all fields (i.e. `todo`, `todoes` and `todoesConnection`). For `Mutation` we're using `prismaFields` to customize the exposed operations.

`prismaFields` lets us select the operations to be exposed. In this case, we only want to keep the operation to _create_ a model (`createTodo`). From the generated CRUD building blocks, we're including neither `updateTodo` nor `deleteTodo` but implement our own `markAsDone(id: ID!)` mutation that checks off a certain `Todo`.

---

## Example: From standard CRUD to a customized GraphQL API

Let's now take a quick tour through a standard Prisma use case and see how to quickly build a GraphQL API for a blogging app in a few easy steps. Here's what we'll do:

1. Setup a Prisma project (using a free demo database) with TypeScript
1. Define models, migrate database and generate the Prisma client
1. Expose full CRUD GraphQL API via `nexus-prisma`
1. Customize the GraphQL API via `nexus-prisma`

If you want to follow along, you need to have the Prisma CLI installed:



```shell
npm install -g prisma
```
```shell
yarn global add prisma
```
```shell
brew tap prisma/prisma
brew install prisma
```


### 1) Setup Prisma project with TypeScript, `nexus` and `nexus-prisma`

This section mostly deals with your project setup. Feel free to skip it if you don't want to code along, otherwise expand the section below.

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="See project setup instructions">
Use the Prisma CLI to create a simple Prisma project:



```shell
prisma init myblog
```


In the interactive prompt, select the following options:

1. Select **Demo server** (includes a free & hosted demo database in Prisma Cloud)
1. **Authenticate** with Prisma Cloud in your browser (if necessary)
1. Back in your terminal, **confirm all suggested values**

> As an alternative to the Demo server, you can also [run Prisma locally using Docker](https://v1.prisma.io/docs/1.34/prisma-server/deployment-environments/docker-rty1/).

Next you need to configure your `nexus-prisma` workflow. Add the following dependencies (inside the `myblog` directory):



```shell
npm init -y
npm install --save nexus graphql nexus-prisma prisma-client-lib graphql-yoga
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node-dev
```


Next, add the following two lines to the end of your `prisma.yml`:



```yml
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - prisma generate
    - npx nexus-prisma-generate --client ./generated/prisma-client --output ./generated/nexus-prisma
```


This ensures that the Prisma client as well as the generated `nexus-prisma` CRUD building blocks are being updated whenever you make changes to your models.

Since we're using TypeScript, let's quickly add a `tsconfig.json`:



```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "strict": true,
    "lib": ["esnext", "dom"]
  }
}
```


Finally, go ahead and add a `start` script that you'll use for development. It starts a development server that watches your files in the background and updates the generated SDL and Nexus typings as you code. Add this to your `package.json`:



```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "ts-node-dev --no-notify --respawn --transpileOnly ./"
},
```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### 2) Define models, migrate database & generate the Prisma client

The `prisma init` command created a default `User` model in `datamodel.prisma`. As we're building a blogging application, let's adjust the models to our application domain:



```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  email: String! @unique
  name: String
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  title: String!
  content: String
  author: User!
}
```


Next you need to migrate the database by applying the datamodel to it. Using the following command, each model defined in `datamodel.prisma` will be mapped to a table in the underlying database:



```shell
prisma deploy
```



Because you configured the `post-deploy` hook in `prisma.yml` earlier, your Prisma client and the CRUD building blocks are automatically updated.

### 3) Expose full CRUD GraphQL API via `nexus-prisma`

In the early phase of a project, it's often helpful to have full CRUD capabilities exposed by an API – more constrained API requirements typically emerge over time. `nexus-prisma` perfectly accounts for that by providing a straightforward path to go from full CRUD to customized API operations.

Let's start with a GraphQL API that exposes full CRUD for the defined models (note that this includes filters, pagination and sorting). Create a new file called `index.ts` and add the following code to it:



```ts
import * as path from 'path'
import { GraphQLServer } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { makePrismaSchema, prismaObjectType } from 'nexus-prisma'
import { prisma } from './generated/prisma-client'
import datamodelInfo from './generated/nexus-prisma'

const Query = prismaObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  definition: t => t.prismaFields(['*']),
})
const Mutation = prismaObjectType({
  name: 'Mutation',
  definition: t => t.prismaFields(['*']),
})

const schema = makePrismaSchema({
  types: [Query, Mutation],

  prisma: {
    datamodelInfo,
    client: prisma,
  },

  outputs: {
    schema: path.join(__dirname, './generated/schema.graphql'),
    typegen: path.join(__dirname, './generated/nexus.ts'),
  },
})

const server = new GraphQLServer({
  schema,
  context: { prisma },
})
server.start(() => console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:4000`))
```


> We're not paying much attention to file structure in this short tutorial. Check our [`graphql-auth`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/master/typescript/graphql-auth) example for a proper setup and modularized schema.

After running `npm run start`, you can open the GraphQL Playground for your GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000`. With the little code you wrote above, you already have a full-blown GraphQL CRUD API at your disposal.

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="See some example queries and mutations">
#### Example queries

```graphql
# Fetch all posts with their authors
query {
  posts {
    id
    title
    published
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
```graphql
# Fetch a certain user by email
query {
  user(where: { email: "alice@prisma.io" }) {
    id
    name
    posts {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```
#### Example mutations

```graphql
# Create a post and its author
mutation {
  createPost(data: { title: "Hello World", author: { create: { email: "bob@prisma.io" } } }) {
    id
    published
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
```graphql
# Update the name of a user
mutation {
  updateUser(data: { name: "Alice" }, where: { email: "alice@prisma.io " }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
```graphql
# Delete a user
mutation {
  deleteUser(where: { email: "alice@prisma.io " }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

How does that work? `nexus-prisma-generate` generated a GraphQL schema that provides a CRUD API for Prisma models (your _CRUD building blocks_). This GraphQL schema follows the [OpenCRUD](https://www.opencrud.org/) specification. Using the `prismaObjectType` function, you can now expose and customize the operations of that schema.

`prismaObjectType` and `prismaFields` use a _whitelist_ approach, meaning you need to explicitly list the fields you want to expose. The wildcard operator `*` includes _all_ fields.

![Expose full CRUD GraphQL API via nexus-prisma](/blog/using-graphql-nexus-with-a-database-pmyl3660ncst/imgs/RLsS1lm.png)

### 4) Customize the GraphQL API via `nexus-prisma`

In this section, we'll learn how the CRUD GraphQL API from `nexus-prisma` can be customized. Specifically, we are going to:

1. Hide a field from the `User` model
1. Add a computed field to the `Post` model
1. Hide the `createPost` and `updatePost` mutations
1. Add two custom `createDraft` and `publish` mutations

#### 4.1) Hide a field from the `User` model

In this section, we'll hide the `email` field from the `User` model.

To customize a model, we need to apply the `prismaObjectType` function to it and pass the `definition(t)` function as an option:



```ts
const User = prismaObjectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.prismaFields(['id', 'name', 'posts'])
  },
})
```


By calling `prismaFields` on the model `t`, we can customize the exposed fields (and their arguments). Because `email` is not included in the list, it's removed from our GraphQL API.

![Hide a field from the User model](/blog/using-graphql-nexus-with-a-database-pmyl3660ncst/imgs/Zwby9Hs.png)

To apply the changes, you need to explicitily pass `User` to the `types` array inside of `makePrismaSchema`:



```ts
const schema = makePrismaSchema({
  types: [Query, Mutation, User],

  // ...
}
```


Note that your editor is able to suggest what to pass into `prismaObjectType` and `prismaFields` based on the generated CRUD building blocks. This means when you type `prismaObjectType('')` and hit **ctrl+space**, it suggests the names of all generated CRUD building blocks. When calling `t.prismaFields([''])`, it suggests the fields of `t`:

{/* <Video src="/blog/using-graphql-nexus-with-a-database-pmyl3660ncst/imgs/MOArOPF.mp4" width={960} height={548} /> */}

#### 4.2) Add a computed field to the `Post` model

The new code-first approach with `nexus-prisma` also makes it easy to add computed fields to Prisma models. Say you want to add a field to `Post` that always returns the `title` spelled entirely uppercased. Here's how to implement that:



```ts
const Post = prismaObjectType({
  name: 'Post',
  definition(t) {
    t.prismaFields(['*'])
    t.string('uppercaseTitle', {
      resolve: ({ title }, args, ctx) => title.toUpperCase(),
    })
  },
})
```


We add a new field to our model using the `t.string(...)` API that comes from `graphql-nexus`. Because it's a computed field (and therefore can't be automatically resolved by `nexus-prisma`), we also need to attach a resolver to it.

![Customize the GraphQL API via nexus-prisma](/blog/using-graphql-nexus-with-a-database-pmyl3660ncst/imgs/64ipcsj.png)

As before, you need to explicitly add the customized `Post` model to the `types` array:



```ts
const schema = makePrismaSchema({
  types: [Query, Mutation, User, Post],

  // ...
}
```


#### 4.3) Hide `createPost` and `updatePost` mutations

In the same way that we've hidden the `email` field from the `User` model, we can also hide operations from the `Query`/`Mutation` types that are part of the generated `nexus-prisma` CRUD building blocks.

To hide `createPost` and `updatePost` we again need to pass `definition(t)` to `prismaObjectType` as an option. Note that once we call `prismaFields` on a type, we need to explicitly list all fields we want to keep (an empty array would be interpreted as "keep no operations"):



```ts
const Mutation = prismaObjectType({
  name: 'Mutation',
  definition(t) {
    t.prismaFields(['createUser', 'updateUser', 'deleteUser', 'deletePost'])
  },
})
```


> The generated CRUD GraphQL API also includes batched and upsert operations that we're excluding here for brevity as well.

#### 4. Add two custom `createDraft` and `publish` mutations

Finally, we're adding two custom mutations to our GraphQL API. Here's what their SDL definitions are supposed to look like:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createDraft(title: String!, content: String): Post!
  publish(id: ID!): Post
}
```
To implement these mutations, you need to add two fields (by calling `t.field( ... )` from the `nexus` API) to the `Mutation` type:



```ts
const Mutation = prismaObjectType({
  name: 'Mutation',
  definition(t) {
    t.prismaFields(['createUser', 'updateUser', 'deleteUser', 'deletePost'])
    t.field('createDraft', {
      type: 'Post',
      args: {
        title: stringArg(),
        content: stringArg({ nullable: true }),
      },
      resolve: (parent, { title, content }, ctx) => {
        return ctx.prisma.createPost({ title, content })
      },
    })
    t.field('publish', {
      type: 'Post',
      nullable: true,
      args: {
        id: idArg(),
      },
      resolve: (parent, { id }, ctx) => {
        return ctx.prisma.updatePost({
          where: { id },
          data: { published: true },
        })
      },
    })
  },
})
```


Be sure to import `stringArg` and `idArg` from the `nexus` package to make this work.

GraphQL Nexus also generates the SDL version of your GraphQL schema, you find it in `./generated/schema.graphql`. The final version of our GraphQL API looks as follows:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createDraft(content: String, title: String): Post!
  createUser(data: UserCreateInput!): User!
  deletePost(where: PostWhereUniqueInput!): Post
  deleteUser(where: UserWhereUniqueInput!): User
  publish(id: ID): Post
  updateUser(data: UserUpdateInput!, where: UserWhereUniqueInput!): User
}

type Query {
  node(id: ID!): Node
  post(where: PostWhereUniqueInput!): Post
  posts(
    after: String
    before: String
    first: Int
    last: Int
    orderBy: PostOrderByInput
    skip: Int
    where: PostWhereInput
  ): [Post!]!
  postsConnection(
    after: String
    before: String
    first: Int
    last: Int
    orderBy: PostOrderByInput
    skip: Int
    where: PostWhereInput
  ): PostConnection!
  user(where: UserWhereUniqueInput!): User
  users(
    after: String
    before: String
    first: Int
    last: Int
    orderBy: UserOrderByInput
    skip: Int
    where: UserWhereInput
  ): [User!]!
  usersConnection(
    after: String
    before: String
    first: Int
    last: Int
    orderBy: UserOrderByInput
    skip: Int
    where: UserWhereInput
  ): UserConnection!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  posts(
    after: String
    before: String
    first: Int
    last: Int
    orderBy: PostOrderByInput
    skip: Int
    where: PostWhereInput
  ): [Post!]
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  author: User!
  content: String
  published: Boolean!
  title: String!
  uppercaseTitle: String!
}

## 3 key takeways from our code-first GraphQL articles

This was the last part of our articles series on code-first GraphQL server development.

[GraphQL Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/) and the `nexus-prisma` plugin implement the learnings we've gathered from being active contributors to the GraphQL ecosystem for well over two years. After having found too many issues with an [SDL-first](https://www.prisma.io/blog/the-problems-of-schema-first-graphql-development-x1mn4cb0tyl3) approach, we're incredibly excited about the new code-first tooling that's currently emerging.

We strongly believe that GraphQL Nexus (and other code-first approaches such as [TypeGraphQL](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql)) are going to drastically change the way how GraphQL schemas will be built in the future.

Here are our main takeways from the series:

1. Code-first approaches let you build GraphQL servers in language-idiomatic ways without the need for additional tooling ("the only tool you need is your programming language") while retaining the benefits of SDL as a communication tool.
1. GraphQL Nexus lets developers construct their schemas with a flexible and type-safe API. Developers get an amazing experience thanks to auto-completion and build-time error checks.
1. The `nexus-prisma` plugin builds on top of the Prisma models and lets developers build a GraphQL API by exposing and customizing auto-generated CRUD building blocks.
