  With AI-native IDEs, we are all developing apps with remarkable speed. So much so that managing infrastructure is becoming the bottleneck. With [Prisma’s MCP server](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/mcp-server), Cursor, Windsurf and other AI tools, can now provision and manage Postgres databases for your apps, so you don’t have to spend time fiddling with infrastructure.

## Use Prisma Postgres in your favorite AI tool using MCP

The [Model-Context-Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) gives LLMs a way to call APIs and thus access external systems in a well-defined manner. Prisma's MCP server gives LLMs the ability to manage [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) databases (e.g. spin up new database instances or run schema migrations).

We're excited to share that as of [v6.6.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.6.0), the Prisma CLI now comes with a built-in MCP server that you can integrate in your favorite AI tool using this snippet:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Prisma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prisma", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
If you're curious what exactly the integration looks like in any specific tool, [check out our docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/mcp-server) with instructions for adding the MCP server to **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Claude Code / Desktop** and the **OpenAI Agents SDK**.

## Prisma Postgres: The database designed for the age of AI

[Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) has been created for the new age of AI development! It is the [first serverless database built on highly-efficient unikernels](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-postgres-early-access), designed to run thousands, even millions(!), of database instances on a single machine.

It offers the reliability developers need without the operational complexity that AI can't abstract away. When AI helps you move faster on code generation, you need infrastructure that keeps pace – scalable, on-demand, and requiring minimal configuration.

## "Vibe code" your apps with Prisma Postgres

_Vibe coding_ has been a major trend lately — it describes developers building their applications purely based on prompting and AI-generated code. 

While vibe coded apps don't yet cross the threshold of complexity required for serious application development, the wider trend of AI-assisted coding is certainly reshaping the software development industry! Repetitive and monotonous coding tasks, features with very detailed specifications  and prototyping are areas that are seeing major productivity boosts by AI and let developers build applications at new speed levels. 

**In this new world, the pace of _writing code_ often isn't the bottleneck any more — it's rather the tasks that AI can't help with: Provisioning, configuring and managing infrastructure.**

With Prisma's new MCP server, you can reduce the infrastructure management overhead and align it with the speed at which you're writing code thanks to your powerful AI assistants. 

### First-class integration with Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code and any other AI tool

The most popular AI coding tools all offer first-class integrations for MCP servers. Here's how you can add it to your favorite tool:




```js
// File: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Prisma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prisma", "mcp"]
    },
    // other MCP servers
  }
}
```
```js
// File: `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Prisma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prisma", "mcp"]
    },
    // other MCP servers
  }
}
```
```shell
# In you terminal
claude mcp add prisma npx prisma mcp
```

    

### What to do with Prisma's MCP server?

Prisma's MCP server allows you to chat in natural language through database provisioning, data modeling and migration workflows. 

It connects your AI assistant to the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) and lets it perform these tasks on your behalf. Here are some things the MCP server enables:

- Create and manage Prisma Postgres instances
- Brainstorm the data model for your application
- Run migrations against your Prisma Postgres database

### Scaffold new projects with: `prisma init --vibe` 😎

As a bonus, we add a `--vibe` (alias for `--prompt`) option to the `prisma init` command which is going to scaffold a Prisma schema and deploy it to a fresh Prisma Postgres instance for you:
```
npx prisma init --vibe "Cat meme generator"
```
