excerpt: |
  We are adjusting our release policy to adhere more strictly to Semantic Versioning. In the future, breaking changes in the stable development surface (i.e. [General Availability](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#generally-available-ga)) will only be rolled out with _major_ version increments.

## TL;DR

Here is a brief overview of the new rules we are putting in place:

- By adopting SemVer, we're making it easier for users to understand which version may contain breaking changes. The adoption of SemVer is merely a change to our release policy to be consistent with industry practices and improve the developer experience.
- Breaking changes in stable surface (i.e. [General Availability](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#generally-available-ga)) will only be introduced in new _major versions_.
- Breaking changes can still be rolled out in _minor versions_ but only for opt-in Preview and Early Access features that are not active by default (e.g. via a Preview feature flag or a specific opt-in option or new CLI command).
- Opt-in breaking changes, i.e. Preview and Early Access, released in _minor versions_ will only be promoted to General Availability (no requirement for opt-in) in new _major versions_.

You can read more details about this in the [Releases and maturity levels](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases) section in our [documentation](https://www.prisma.io/).

## Prisma releases adopt SemVer

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) is a conventional release strategy that has clear rules for when users can expect breaking changes in a software release.

While we already followed the 3-digit SemVer _notation_ for Prisma releases, we didn't quite follow the actual SemVer _semantics_ yet. This meant that we sometimes released breaking changes upon _minor_ version increments.

In the future, breaking changes in _minor_ version increments will always be opt-in. Any breaking change to the stable developer surface of the Prisma ORM will only happen in _major_ version increments.

Currently, it's hard for users to understand which version may or not contain breaking changes. When upgrading through multiple versions, e.g. from `2.13.0` to `2.26.0`, you have to read the release notes of each intermediate release to determine which breaking changes will impact you – this makes it hard to navigate breaking changes.

## What this means for you?

In essence, the new release policy doesn't change anything about how you use Prisma and the ongoing evolution of Prisma. We're just making it easier for you to understand which version may contain breaking changes.

Prisma will continue to document the exact details for upcoming breaking changes in the release notes. Additionally, we will provide upgrade guides to help with the upgrade path between major releases.

Many of the package managers and dependency automation tools in the industry were designed with SemVer in mind, e.g. [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/) and [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/). They save you time by automating parts of the dependency upgrade process, creating pull requests with relevant release changes, and automatically merging non-breaking changes.

## Why we are adopting SemVer semantics

Updating dependencies can be a time-consuming process – especially in projects with many dependencies. **Adhering to Semver should improve your upgrade experience as breaking changes become predictable and visible moving forward.**

SemVer is a widely used industry standard, especially in the Node.js ecosystem.

As we're seeing more developers and companies adopt Prisma and getting helpful feedback about our release strategy, we've decided to adjust our release strategy and fully adopt SemVer in the future.

## One of Prisma's upcoming releases will have breaking changes

One of the upcoming Prisma [releases](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) will come with breaking changes. Following our new release strategy, the _major_ version number will be incremented, and Prisma's new version will therefore be `3.x.x`.

You can read more about our release strategy in the [documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases).
