## Collaborate on your data with your team

[Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio)'s data browser is great tool for local development. It allows individual developers to quickly view the data in their database, validate the result of a query and make manual data changes when needed.

As more and more developers started to adopt Prisma Studio for their local development, many of them wanted to take their workflows a step further and be able to _collaborate_ on their data.

## What can you do with Prisma's online data browser?

Acting on this feedback, we are excited to share an [Early Access](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#early-access) version of an online and collaborative data browser for your team ✨

<br />
[Try Prisma's Online Data Browser](https://cloud.prisma.io/)

> **Note**: The online data browser is released in [Early Access](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#early-access). This means it is not production-ready and we are actively seeking feedback that helps us improve it. Please [report](https://github.com/prisma/studio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=topic%3A+hosted+data+browser&template=hosted-data-browser-bug-report.md&title=) any UX issues, bugs or other friction points that you encounter.

It has the following features:

- Import your Prisma projects from GitHub.
- Add other users to it, such as your teammates or your clients.
- Assign users one of four roles: _Admin_, _Developer_, _Collaborator_, _Viewer_.
- View and edit your data collaboratively online.

Let's look at these workflows a bit more closely in the following sections.

### Import your Prisma projects from GitHub

In order to add you Prisma you need to sign up with your GitHub account and select the GitHub repository that contains your [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema) file:

Next, you will need to provide the remote connection URL of your online database:

If you don't have one yet, you can learn how to create a free PostgreSQL database on Heroku [here](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1).

### Add other users to the project

Once created, you can invite other GitHub users to your project to collaborate:

Other users can have one of four roles in a project:

- **Admin:** Can do all possible actions, e.g. configuring project settings and viewing/editing data.
- **Collaborator:** Access the data browser and view and edit data.
- **Developer:** Same as collaborators for now, will eventually have more developer-oriented feature like viewing the schema.
- **Viewer:** Access the data browser and view data.

### View and edit your data collaboratively online

The online data browswer has all the awesome data viewing and editing features you're used to from your local Prisma Studio. A few highlights include:

- Viewing your database records shaped as Prisma models
- Configuring powerful filters, pagination and sorting
- Showing a subset of a model's fields
- Navigating and configuring relations across models with ease
