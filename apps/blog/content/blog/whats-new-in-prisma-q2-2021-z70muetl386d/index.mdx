## Releases & new features

Our engineers have been hard at work issuing new [releases](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/) with many improvements and new features every two weeks. Here is an overview of the most exciting features that we have launched in the last three months.

You can stay up-to-date about all upcoming features on our [roadmap](https://pris.ly/roadmap).

### Launched Prisma's online data browser in Early Access

Prisma's online data browser allows you to easily collaborate with your team on your data. You can:

- Import your Prisma projects from GitHub.
- Add other users to it, such as your teammates or your clients.
- Assign users one of four roles: Admin, Developer, Collaborator, Viewer.
- View and edit your data collaboratively online.

> Note: The online data browser is released in Early Access. This means it is not production-ready and we are actively seeking feedback that helps us improve it. Please report any UX issues, bugs or other friction points that you encounter.

You can try it today and we would love to [know your feedback](https://github.com/prisma/studio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=topic%3A+hosted+data+browser&template=hosted-data-browser-bug-report.md&title=)!

### Referential Actions now enable cascading deletes and updates (Preview)

Since [2.26.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.26.0), we introduced a new feature in [Preview](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#preview) which allow you to define cascading delete and update behavior in your Prisma schema. Here’s an example:

```prisma
model User {
  id    String @id
  posts Post[]
}
model Post {
  id       String @id
  authorId String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
}
```
If you run into any questions or have any feedback, we’re available in this [issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7816).

### `prisma db push` is now generally available 🚀

`prisma db push` enables you to update the database schema from the Prisma schema file, without generating any migrations.

This is especially useful when prototyping a new feature, iterating on the schema changes before creating migrations or generally if you are at stage of your development process, where you don't need to persist the schema change history via database migrations.

It is now promoted from [Preview](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#preview) to [General Availability](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#generally-available-ga). You can find more info on `prisma db push` in the [official docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push).

### Human-readable drift diagnostics for `prisma migrate dev`

Since [2.25.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.25.0), Database schema drift occurs when your database schema is out of sync with your migration history, i.e. the database schema has drifted away from the source of truth.

With this release, we improve the way how the drift is printed to the console when detected in the `prisma migrate dev` command.

While this is thew only command that uses this notation in today's release, we plan to use it in other places where it would be useful for debugging in the future.

```shell
[*] Changed the `Color` enum
  [+] Added variant `TRANSPARENT`
  [-] Removed variant `RED`
[*] Changed the `Cat` table
  [-] Removed column `color`
  [+] Added column `vaccinated`
[*] Changed the `Dog` table
  [-] Dropped the primary key on columns (id)
  [-] Removed column `name`
  [+] Added column `weight`
  [*] Altered column `isGoodDog` (arity changed from Nullable to Required, default changed from `None` to `Some(Value(Boolean(true)))`)
  [+] Added unique index on columns (weight)
```
### New features for the Prisma Client API

We regularly add new features to the Prisma Client API to enable more powerful database queries that were previously only possible via plain SQL and the `$queryRaw` escape hatch.

#### Support for .env files in Prisma Client Go

You can now use a .env file with Prisma Client Go. This makes it easier to keep database credentials outside your Prisma schema and potentially work with multiple clients at the same time:
```
example/
├── .env
├── main.go
└── schema.prisma
```
Learn more about using the .env file in our [documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/development-environment/environment-variables#using-env-files).

#### MongoDB gets Json and Enum Support

In [2.24.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.24.0), we added `Json` and `enum` support to the MongoDB provider for Prisma Client. Here's a sample schema with both:

```prisma
prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["mongodb"]
}
model Log {
  id      String @id @default(dbgenerated()) @map("_id")
  message String
  level   Level  @default(Info)
  meta    Json
}
enum Level {
  Info
  Warn
  Error
}
```
As a reminder, the mongodb provider is still in [Early Access](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#early-access). If you'd like to use MongoDB with Prisma, please fill out this [2-minute Typeform](https://prisma-data.typeform.com/to/FriDuIeM) and we'll get you an invite to our Getting Started guide and private Slack channel right away!

#### JSON filtering (preview)

Since [2.23.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.23.0), you can now filter rows by data inside a Json type. JSON filtering support is available in PostgreSQL and MySQL.

Assuming we have the following data in a database:

| id  | level   | message                            | meta                                                           |
| --- | ------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2   | `INFO`  | application listening on port 3000 | `{"host": "bob"}`                                              |
| 3   | `INFO`  | upgrading account                  | `{"host": "alice", "request_id": 10}`                          |
| 4   | `INFO`  | charging customer                  | `{"host": "alice", "amount": 20, "request_id": 10}`            |
| 5   | `ERROR` | credit card expired                | `{"host": "alice", "amount": 20, "request_id": 10}`            |
| 6   | `INFO`  | signing up                         | `{"host": "bob", "request_id": 1}`                             |
| 7   | `INFO`  | application listening on port 3000 | `{"host": "alice"}`                                            |
| 8   | `INFO`  | signed up                          | `{"host": "bob", "email": "james@gmail.com", "request_id": 1}` |

We can now filter logs by the data inside the meta field.



```ts
const logs = await prisma.log.findMany({
  where: {
    meta: {
      // path looks for the request_id key inside meta
      path: ['request_id'],
      // and we select rows whose request_id is 10
      equals: 10,
    },
  },
  orderBy: {
    id: 'asc',
  },
})
```
```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["filterJson"]
}

model Log {
  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  level   Level
  message String
  meta    Json
}

enum Level {
  INFO
  WARN
  ERROR
}
```


#### Order by an aggregate in groupBy (preview)

Since [2.21.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.21.0), you can Order by an aggregate in groupBy. Let's say you want to group your users by the city they live in and then order the results by the cities with the most users.



```ts
const userRatingsCount = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ['city'],
  count: {
    city: true,
  },
  orderBy: {
    _count: {
      city: 'desc',
    },
  },
}
```
```prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  city  String
}
```


The query returns the following data:
```
[
  { city: 'Berlin', count: { city: 3 } },
  { city: 'Paris', count: { city: 2 } },
  { city: 'Amsterdam', count: { city: 1 } },
]
```
## Community

We wouldn't be where we are today without our amazing [community](https://www.prisma.io/community) of developers. Our [Slack](https://slack.prisma.io) has more than 40k members and is a great place to ask questions, share feedback and initiate discussions all around Prisma.

### Prisma Day 2021

[Prisma Day](https://www.prisma.io/day) has been a huge success and we want to thank everyone who attended and helped making it a great experience! It was a two day event of talks and workshops by members of the Prisma community.

This was our **3rd** Prisma day which had **15** amazing talks and an introduction to Prisma workshop offered in **11** different languages.

We've been excited to see fantastic speakers, educators sharing their knowledge and what they're working on. We would also love to thank the amazing workshop hosts for delivering exceptional workshops.

The event covered a broad range of topics:

- Modern Application Development: from type safety and TypeScript, or GraphQL, or JAMStack and the latest Javascript Frameworks, get an overview of the evolving tool landscape that reshapes how applications are architected, built, and deployed.
- Database best practices: a deeper dive into considerations when building stateful applications. Discover the key considerations that give you further control over getting the most out of your data.
- Prisma in Production: discover how users implement Prisma in the their critical applications and what Prisma has in store in the future.

If you missed the event, you can watch all the talks on our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn2e1F9Rfr6mjeYBSsSZoHFVjMq0nCtfL).

### Tweets for trees

To celebrate [Earth Day](https://erthday.org) 🌍, we started the [Tweets for trees](https://www.prisma.io/blog/tweets-for-trees-arboreal) initiative.
This was an initiative where we planted a tree for every tweet about Prisma during the month of April.
We planted a total of **269 trees 🌳** for our [Prisma forrest](https://tree-nation.com/profile/impact/prisma-data-services-gmbh).

## Stickers

We love seeing laptops that are decorated with Prisma stickers, so we're shipping sticker packs for free to our community members! In this quarter, we've sent out over 300 sticker packs to developers that are excited about Prisma!
