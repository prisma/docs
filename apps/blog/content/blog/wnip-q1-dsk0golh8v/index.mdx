## Releases & new features

Our engineers have been working hard, issuing new [releases](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/) with many improvements and new features. This quarter, we adjusted our release cadence to every three weeks. Here is an overview of the most exciting features we've launched in the last three months.


You can stay up-to-date about all upcoming features on our [roadmap](https://pris.ly/roadmap).

### MongoDB is now Generally Available

This quarter was packed with lots of new features and improvements to the MongoDB connector, now Generally Available. MongoDB was launched in [Preview](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#preview) in July 2021 we've been working hard towards pushing it towards stability and polishing it to make it production-ready.

Here are some of the feature highlights we developed over this period:

- Expressive and type-safe operations for querying MongoDB **embedded documents**
- Increased likelihood of **referential integrity** in your database
- Thorough **introspection support** for using Prisma with existing MongoDB databases
- **Declarative index management** right from your Prisma schema with `prisma db push`
- Powerful **raw query APIs** to help you incrementally migrate to Prisma

#### Embedded documents support

In [`3.10.0`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/3.10.0) we introduced support for reading and modifying embedded documents. Embedded documents provide access to a new `type` keyword in your Prisma schema you can use to define composite types.

```prisma
model Product {
  id     String  @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  name   String
  photos Photo[]
}

type Photo {
  height Int
  width  Int
  url    String
}
```
Given the schema above, you can now read and write to the embedded `photos` array:

```ts
// Create a new product with an embedded list of photos
const product = await prisma.product.create({
  data: {
    name: "Forest Runners",
    // Create an embedded list of photos in the product
    photos: [
      { height: 100, width: 200, url: "1.png" },
      { height: 300, width: 400, url: "2.png" },
    ],
  },
})
```
#### Introspection of embedded documents

In `3.4.0`, we added preview support for the introspection of embedded documents. Running `prisma db pull` against your MongoDB database will generate `type` definitions within your Prisma schema.

When introspecting your database, you can switch off the introspection of composite types with `--composite-type-depth=0` or limit the depth level of the analysis with, for example, `--composite-type-depth=2`.

We took this further and updated the type inference behavior for embedded documents with mixed data types on introspection. From version [`3.11.0`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/3.11.0), Prisma now defaults to a `Json` type for all fields that have mixed data types.

Prisma will also show a warning on the console and add a comment to the introspected Prisma schema file to clarify where a field has a mixed data type.

#### Index support for composite type fields

In [`3.12.0`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/3.12.0), we added support for adding indexes on embedded document fields in MongoDB. You can now define a normal, unique, or full-text index in your schema.

```prisma
type Address {
  street String
  number Int
}

model User {
  id      Int     @id
  email   String
  address Address

  @@index([email, address.number])
  @@unique([email, address.street])
  @@fulltext([email, address.street])
}
```
#### Embedded document filters support

In `3.11.0`, we added the ability to filter embedded documents.

Given the following schema:

```prisma
model Product {
  id     String  @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  photos Photo[]
}

model Order {
  id              String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  shippingAddress Address
  billingAddress  Address?
}

type Photo {
  height Int
  width  Int
  url    String
}

type Address {
  street String
  city   String
  zip    String
}
```
You can now add filters within an embedded document:

```ts
// find all orders with the same shipping address
const orders = await prisma.order.findMany({
  where: {
    shippingAddress: {
      equals: {
        street: "555 Candy Cane Lane",
        city: "Wonderland",
        zip: "52337",
      },  
    },
  },
})
```
You can also add a filter on a "contains many" relationship:

```ts
// find all products that don't have photos
const product = prisma.product.findMany({
  where: {
    photos: {
      isEmpty: true
    }
  },
})
```
This is just the tip of the iceberg of what's possible. To learn more, refer to our [documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/composite-types) for a complete list of available operations.

#### Ordering by embedded documents

In addition to embedded document filters, `3.11.0` added support for sorting by embedded documents.

Using the schema from the previous example, you can sort orders by their zip code:

```ts
// sort orders by zip code in ascending order
const orders = await prisma.order.findMany({
  orderBy: {
    shippingAddress: {
      zip: "asc",
    },
  },
})
```
#### Raw query support

Raw queries in MongoDB help in writing queries Prisma doesn't support yet, such as:

```ts
// To find zero or more documents matching a filter
const result = await prisma.user.findRaw({
  filter: { age: { $gt: 25 } },
  options: { projection: { _id: false } },
})

// To perform aggregation operations on a collection
await prisma.user.aggregateRaw({
  pipeline: [
    { $match: { status: 'registered' } },
    { $group: { _id: '$country', total: { $sum: 1 } } },
  ],
})

// To run a command against the database
await prisma.$runCommandRaw({
  aggregate: 'User',
  pipeline: [
    { $match: { name: 'Bob' } },
    { $project: { email: true, _id: false } },
  ],
  explain: false,
})
```
The raw query API for MongoDB differs from Prisma's `$queryRaw` SQL API to handle some low-level differences between databases to give you a better API and developer experience.

#### Support for query logging

You can enable query logging in Prisma Client when working with MongoDB from version `3.11.0`.

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [
    {
      emit: 'event',
      level: 'query',
    },
  ]
})

prisma.$on('query', (e) => console.log(e.query))
```
Prisma Client logs queries in the same format as the `mongosh` console. You can use the queries from your logs directly into your shell.

#### Filters no longer return `undefined` fields by default

In [`3.11.1`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/3.11.1), we've changed the data returned when filtering MongoDB documents on `undefined` fields. The new rule is that `undefined` fields are excluded by default unless explicitly filtered for. This allows you to query for `undefined` and `null` values separately.


For example, given the following Prisma schema:
```prisma
model Address {
    id     Int    @id @map("_id")
    city   String
    street String? // Note that street is optional
}
```
For MongoDB, optional fields can either be `null` or `undefined` (absent). The following documents are all valid for the schema above:

```ts
{ "_id": 1, "city": "San Fransisco", "street": "Market st." }
{ "_id": 2, "city": "Seattle", "street": null }
{ "_id": 3, "city": "Chicago" }
```
Prior to `3.11.1`, if you queried for `where: { street: null }`, you'd get `_id: 2` and `_id: 3`. In `3.11.1`, you'll only get `_id: 2`. The ability to _also_ query for the missing fields has also been added. Refer to the new `isSet` below to learn more.

There are a few exceptions to this new default:
- A `having` filter on an aggregated field *will* return `undefined` fields. This is because aggregation on undefined fields yields `null`, not `undefined`, thus matching the filter.
- Filters on undefined to-many relations (e.g., the backing array of a many-to-many is `undefined`) will currently include those relations in the result set.

#### New `isSet` filter operation

To compensate for missing fields on documents no longer being returned by the filters above, we’ve added a new `isSet: bool` filter. This filter can be used to include fields that are `undefined` on documents.

The `isSet` operation has been added to all scalar and embedded fields that are optional.

Using the example above, to include the `undefined` fields, you can use an `OR`:

```ts
await prisma.address.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { street: { isSet: false } },
      { street: null }
    ]
  }
})
```
#### New `unset` operation

From `3.11.1`, you can also remove a field with the `unset` operation. 

Using the example above, let's write a query to remove the street field:

```ts
// set the `street` field to `undefined` in the database
await prisma.address.update({
  where: {
    id: 10,
  },
  data: {
    street: {
      unset: true,
    },
  },
})
```
#### New `updateMany` operation

Prisma now supports updating embedded documents that match specific criteria. 

For example, given the following schema:

```prisma
model Product {
  id          Int  @id @map("_id")
  name        String  @unique
  photos      Photo[]
}

type Photo {
  height Int    @default(200)
  width  Int    @default(100)
  url    String
}
```
You would then update photo with a `url` of `1.png` to `2.png`:

```ts
const product = prisma.product.update({
  where: {
    id: 10,
  },
  data: {
    photos: {
      updateMany: {
        where: {
          url: '1.png',
        },
        data: {
          url: '2.png',
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```
#### New `deleteMany` operation

Similar to `updateMany`, you can also remove embedded documents that match specific criteria.

Using the Prisma schema from the previous example, you can delete all photos with a `height` of 100:

```ts
const product = prisma.product.update({
  where: {
    id: 10,
  },
  data: {
    photos: {
      deleteMany: {
        where: {
          height: 100,
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```
#### Many-to-Many relations require a reference argument

From `3.10.0`, Prisma now enforces all the arguments in a MongoDB many-to-many relation. A `@relation` attribute must define `fields` and `references` argument to both sides.

The `fields` argument must point to a scalar field in the same model and must be an array. The `references` argument must point to a scalar field in the opposite model, and it must be a singular type of the same base type as the referencing array on the other side.

```diff
model Post {
  id           String     @id @map("_id") @default(auto()) @db.ObjectId
  category_ids String[]   @db.ObjectId
- categories   Category[] @relation(fields: [category_ids])
+ categories   Category[] @relation(fields: [category_ids], references: [id])
}
    
model Category {
  id       String   @id @map("_id") @default(auto()) @db.ObjectId
  post_ids String[] @db.ObjectId
- posts    Post[]   @relation(fields: [post_ids])
+ posts    Post[]   @relation(fields: [post_ids], references: [id])
}
```
#### `@default(dbgenerated())` is now replaced with `@default(auto())`
The original purpose of dbgenerated is to support SQL expressions Prisma doesn’t understand yet. However, MongoDB doesn’t have a concept of default value expressions like SQL does. We took this opportunity to simplify how we handle the default values in MongoDB:

```diff
model Post {
-  id String @id @default(dbgenerated()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
+  id String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
}
```
#### `@db.Array(ObjectId)` is now updated to `@db.ObjectId`

We've adjusted the Prisma schema format for scalar lists with native types (like lists of Object IDs). This will likely affect those with many-to-many relationships in MongoDB. We made this change to align MongoDB with our existing SQL databases better:

```diff
model Post {
  id          String     @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
- categoryIDs String[]   @db.Array(ObjectId)
+ categoryIDs String[]   @db.ObjectId
  categories  Category[] @relation(fields: [categoryIDs], references: [id])
}

model Category {
  id      String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
- postIDs String[] @db.Array(ObjectId)
+ postIDs String[] @db.ObjectId
  posts   Post[]   @relation(fields: [postIDs], references: [id])
}
```
### Improved connection pooling resiliency

In [`3.12.0`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/3.12.0), we busted a ghost that has been bugging teams since the early days of the Prisma ORM. Under certain amounts of load, some people reported that the connection pool would sometimes drop connections or deadlock and not recover.

After many sightings and a lot of head-scratching, we could finally reproduce the issue. This allowed us to narrow down the problem to one of our dependencies and fix the problem.

### CockroachDB support is now in Preview

[CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) is a distributed SQL database that shines in its ability to scale efficiently while maintaining developer agility and reducing operational overhead.

CockroachDB support is the product of collaboration with the Cockroach Labs team. You can use Prisma to introspect your existing database with `db pull` and evolve your schema and propagate changes to your database using Prisma Migrate.

Please give it a spin and [let us know what you think](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/11542) to help us iron out the kinks before we push it to General Availability.

### Prisma Client logger revamp

We rewrote our internal logger in `3.11.0` to reduce [lock contention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)#:~:text=lock%20contention%3A%20this%20occurs%20whenever,lock%20held%20by%20the%20other.) and enable future features like tracing. This is the first of many upcoming changes to improve Prisma Client's throughput.


### Prisma Migrate improvements

#### Troubleshooting migrations

We introduced 2 new CLI commands into Preview to improve the experience of troubleshooting migrations:
- `prisma migrate diff`
- `prisma db execute`

Since we pushed Prisma Migrate for General Availability last year, we've gotten a ton of feedback to understand the challenges developers experience when building, testing, and deploying migrations.

The `prisma migrate diff` command creates a diff of your database schema, Prisma schema file, or the migration history. You would have to feed the command with a `from` state and a `to` state to get a SQL script or human-readable diff in return.

As a companion to the `prisma migrate diff`, we also built `prisma db execute` to execute SQL scripts against a database. You can pipe the output from `prisma migrate diff` directly to `prisma db execute --stdin`.

Both commands are non-interactive, so it's possible to build many new workflows such as forward and backward migrations with some automation tooling.

#### Detecting state of a diff with `prisma migrate diff` using an exit code

We also introduced a new `--exit-code` flag to the `prisma migrate diff` command to detect the state of a diff in several ways.

You can use the flag as follows:

```shell
npx prisma migrate diff --preview-feature \
--exit-code \
--from-[...] \
--to-[...]
```
These are the default and changed behaviour of the error codes:
```shell
## Default behavior of exit codes
0: Returned when the diff is empty or non-empty
1: Returned on error

## Changed behavior when --exit-code is used
0: Returned when the diff is empty
1: Returned on error
2: Returned when the diff is non-empty
```
### Full-text search for MySQL is now in Preview

In `3.8.0` we added Preview support for full-text search in MySQL. You can enable full-text support by adding the `fullTextIndex` and `fullTextSearch` Preview flags in your Prisma schema and defining `@@fulltext()` indexes on fields you'd like to use full-text search on.

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextIndex", "fullTextSearch"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Post {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title  String @unique
  @@fulltext([title])
}
```
Running `prisma db push` or `prisma migrate dev` will update your database schema, then running `prisma generate` will re-generate your Prisma Client, enabling you to use full-text search in your application.

```ts
// search for titles that contain cat, but not fox
await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    title: {
      search: "+cat -fox",
    },
  },
})
```
### `dataProxy` and `interactiveTransactions` Preview features are now mutually exclusive

Before `3.8.0`, Prisma `$transaction` queries would fail whenever the Data Proxy and Interactive Transactions Preview features were used together. The `interactiveTransactions` and `dataProxy` Preview flags cannot be used together in this release. Generating the Prisma Client when both Preview features are enabled will throw an error.
### Interactive transactions concurrency

We fixed a [number of issues](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/8707) in version `3.9.0` around timeouts and rollbacks when there were concurrent reads and writes.

If you experienced timeouts or your interactive transactions weren't working quite as you expected, give it another go and let us know what you think. You can learn more about Interactive Transactions in our[ documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/transactions#interactive-transactions-in-preview).

## Community

We wouldn't be where we are today without our amazing [community](https://www.prisma.io/community) of developers. Our [Slack](https://slack.prisma.io) has almost 50k members and is a great place to ask questions, share feedback and initiate discussions all around Prisma.
