## A new paradigm for object-relational mapping

Prisma is a next-generation and [open-source](https://www.github.com/prisma/prisma) ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. It consists of the following tools:

- [**Prisma Client**](https://www.prisma.io/client): Auto-generated and type-safe database client
- [**Prisma Migrate**](https://www.prisma.io/migrate): Declarative data modeling and customizable migrations
- [**Prisma Studio**](https://www.prisma.io/studio): Modern UI to view and edit data

![](/blog/prisma-the-complete-orm-inw24qjeawmb/imgs/CTGhQZ9.png)


These tools can be adopted _together_ or _individually_ in any Node.js or TypeScript project. Prisma currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server (Preview). A [connector for MongoDB](https://www.notion.so/prismaio/Support-MongoDB-9f115ebf4a754069a7d7eaae94dc4651) is in the works, sign up for the Early Access program [here](https://prisma-data.typeform.com/to/FriDuIeM).

### Databases are hard

Working with databases is one of the most challenging areas of application development. _Data modeling_, _schema migrations_ and writing _database queries_ are common tasks application developers deal with every day.

At Prisma, we found that the Node.js ecosytem – while becoming increasingly popular to build database-backed applications – does not provide modern tools for application developers to deal with these tasks.

> Application developers should care about **data** – not SQL

As tools become more specialized, application developers should be able to focus on implementing _value-adding_ features for their organizations instead of spending time plumbing together the layers of their application by writing _glue code_.







### Prisma – The Complete ORM for Node.js & TypeScript

Although Prisma solves similar problems as traditional ORMs, its approach to these problems is fundamentally different.

<Youtube videoId="EEDGwLB55bI" />

#### Data modeling in the Prisma schema

When using Prisma, you define your data model in the [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema). Here's a sample of what your models look like with Prisma:

```prisma
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}
```
Each of these models maps to a table in the underlying database and serves as foundation for the generated data access API provided by Prisma Client. Prisma's [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) provides syntax highlighting, autocompletion, quick fixes and lots of other features to make data modeling a magical and delightful experience ✨

<br />
[Explore the Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema)

#### Database migrations with Prisma Migrate

Prisma Migrate translates the Prisma schema into the required SQL to create and alter the tables in your database. It can be used via the `prisma migrate` commands provided the [Prisma CLI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli).

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Expand to view the generated SQL for the models above">
```sql
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
    "id" SERIAL NOT NULL,
    "title" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "content" TEXT,
    "published" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    "authorId" INTEGER,

    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

CREATE TABLE "User" (
    "id" SERIAL NOT NULL,
    "email" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "name" TEXT,

    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "User.email_unique" ON "User"("email");

ALTER TABLE "Post" ADD FOREIGN KEY ("authorId") REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE `Post` (
    `id` INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `title` VARCHAR(191) NOT NULL,
    `content` VARCHAR(191),
    `published` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    `authorId` INTEGER,

    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

CREATE TABLE `User` (
    `id` INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `email` VARCHAR(191) NOT NULL,
    `name` VARCHAR(191),
UNIQUE INDEX `User.email_unique`(`email`),

    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

ALTER TABLE `Post` ADD FOREIGN KEY (`authorId`) REFERENCES `User`(`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
    "id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "title" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "content" TEXT,
    "published" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    "authorId" INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY ("authorId") REFERENCES "User" ("id") ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE "User" (
    "id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "email" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "name" TEXT
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "User.email_unique" ON "User"("email");
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Post] (
    [id] INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
    [title] NVARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
    [content] NVARCHAR(1000),
    [published] BIT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT [DF__Post__published] DEFAULT 0,
    [authorId] INT,
    CONSTRAINT [PK__Post__id] PRIMARY KEY ([id])
);

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[User] (
    [id] INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
    [email] NVARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
    [name] NVARCHAR(1000),
    CONSTRAINT [PK__User__id] PRIMARY KEY ([id]),
    CONSTRAINT [User_email_unique] UNIQUE ([email])
);

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Post] ADD CONSTRAINT [FK__Post__authorId] FOREIGN KEY ([authorId]) REFERENCES [dbo].[User]([id]) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

While the SQL is generated automatically based on the Prisma schema, you can easily customize it to your specific needs. With this approach, Prisma Migrate [strikes a great balance between _productivity_ and _control_](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-migrate-ga-b5eno5g08d0b#predictable-schema-migrations-with-full-control).

#### Intuitive and type-safe database access with Prisma Client

A major benefit of working with Prisma Client is that it lets developers _think in objects_ and therefore offers a familiar and natural way to reason about their data.

Prisma Client doesn't have the concept of _model instances_. Instead, it helps to formulate database queries that always return plain JavaScript objects. Thanks to the generated types, you get autocompletion for these queries as well.

Also, as a bonus for TypeScript developers: All results of Prisma Client queries are fully typed. In fact, Prisma provides the strongest type-safety guarantees of any TypeScript ORM (you can read a type-safety comparison with TypeORM [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/more/comparisons/prisma-and-typeorm#type-safety)).

Click through the tabs in this code block to explore some Prisma Client queries (or explore the full [API reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference)):



```ts
// Find all posts
const posts = await prisma.post.findMany()
```
```ts
// Find all posts and include their authors in the result
const postsWithAuthors = await prisma.post.findMany({
  include: { author: true },
})
```
```ts
// Create a new user with a new post
const userWithPosts: User = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'ada@prisma.io',
    name: 'Ada Lovelace',
    posts: {
      create: [{ title: 'Hello World' }],
    },
  },
})
```
```ts
// Find all users with `@prisma` emails
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: { contains: '@prisma' },
  },
})
```
```ts
const postsByUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email: 'ada@prisma.io' } }).posts()
```
```ts
const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  take: 5,
  cursor: { id: 2 },
})
```

## Ready for production in mission-critical apps

Prisma has evolved a lot in the past three years and we are incredibly excited to share the result with the developer community.

### From GraphQL to databases

As a company we've gone through a number of major product iterations and pivots over the last years since we've started building developer tools:

![](/blog/prisma-the-complete-orm-inw24qjeawmb/imgs/rEVZs9a.png)

Prisma is the result of the learnings we've gathered from being an early innovator in the GraphQL ecosystem and the insights we gained into the data layers of companies of all sizes, from small startups to major enterprises.

Used by thousands of companies since the initial release three years ago, Prisma has been battle-tested and is ready to be used in mission-critical applications.

### We care about developers

Prisma is developed in the [open](https://github.com/prisma/prisma). Our Product and Engineering teams are monitoring GitHub issues and typically respond within 24 hours after an issue is opened.

New [releases](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases) happen every two weeks with new features, bug fixes and lots of improvements. After each release, we do a [livestream on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn2e1F9Rfr6l1B9RP0A9NdX7i7QIWfBa7) to present the new features and get feedback from our community.

We also try to help developers wherever they raise questions about Prisma, be it on [Slack](https://slack.prisma.io), [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions) or [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/prisma) via a dedicated Community Support team.

Here is our community in numbers:

### From prototyping to development to production

The best developer tools are the ones that go out of your way and easily adapt with the increasing complexity of a project. That's exactly how we designed Prisma.

![](/blog/prisma-the-complete-orm-inw24qjeawmb/imgs/nF2JOQt.png)

Prisma has built-in workflows for all stages of the development lifecycle, from prototyping, to development, to deployment, to CI/CD, to testing and more. Check out our documentation and articles to learn about these workflows and how to accomplish all of them with Prisma.

### Next-generation web frameworks are built on Prisma

We are especially humbled that many framework and library authors choose Prisma as the default ORMs for their tools. Here's a selection of higher-level frameworks that are using Prisma:

- [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/): Fullstack framework based on React & GraphQL
- [Blitz](https://blitzjs.com/): Fullstack framework based on Next.js
- [KeystoneJS](https://next.keystonejs.com/): Headless CMS
- [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev/): DSL for developing fullstack web apps based on React
- [Amplication](http://amplication.com/): Toolset for building fullstack apps based on React & NestJS

## Open-source, and beyond

We are a [VC-funded company](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-raises-series-a-saks1zr7kip6) with a team that's passionate about improving the lives of application developers. While we are starting our journey by building [open-source](https://www.github.com/prisma) tools, our longterm vision for Prisma is much bigger than building "just" an ORM.

During our recent [Enterprise Event](https://www.prisma.io/enterprise-event-2021) and a [Prisma Meetup](https://youtu.be/2g525rJdYFU?t=64), we started sharing this vision which we call an **Application Data Platform**.

> Prisma's vision is to _democratize_ the custom data access layer used by companies like Facebook, Twitter and Airbnb and make it available to development teams and organizations of all sizes.

This idea is largely inspired by companies like Facebook, Twitter and Airbnb that built custom data access layers on top of their databases and other data sources to make it easier for the application developers to access the data they need in a safe and efficient manner.

Prisma's goal is to _democratize_ the idea of this custom data access layer and make it available to development teams and organizations of any size.
