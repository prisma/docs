We are thrilled to announce that Prisma has successfully implemented all the processes and controls required for SOC2 Type II, HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO 27001:2022 certifications. These accomplishments underscore our unwavering commitment to providing secure and reliable software solutions for developers working with databases.

In today's digital landscape, data security and privacy are more critical than ever. By striving to achieve these certifications, we are not just meeting industry standards; we are building trust with our customers and ensuring the highest level of protection for their data.

### SOC2 Type II

SOC2 Type II certification is a rigorous audit that assesses an organization's controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. By striving to achieve this certification, Prisma demonstrates that our internal processes and systems are designed and operated to protect customer data effectively over time. This provides our clients with confidence that their data is handled with the utmost care and security.

### HIPAA

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. Companies that handle protected health information (PHI) must have physical, network, and process security measures in place to ensure compliance. By being HIPAA compliant, Prisma ensures that our products can be safely used in healthcare environments, safeguarding patient data and maintaining trust with healthcare providers.

### GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection regulation that imposes strict guidelines on how organizations collect, store, and process personal data of EU citizens. Compliance with GDPR means that Prisma is committed to protecting the privacy and rights of our users, giving them control over their personal data and ensuring transparency in our data processing activities.

### ISO 27001

ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). By completing all the required steps for this comprehensive standard, our customers are ensured that Prisma has implemented a systematic approach to managing sensitive company and customer information. This includes risk management, ensuring data integrity, and protecting against unauthorized access.
