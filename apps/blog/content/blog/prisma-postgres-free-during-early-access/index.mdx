Dear community,

Since we announced Prisma Postgres two weeks ago, more than *3,000 databases* have been created. This product represents a game-changing new way to enable developers to work with databases. With [our new approach to developing database infrastructure](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-postgres-early-access), we go one step further on Prisma’s journey to make it seamless and easy to work with databases.

We heard feedback from many of you, and two things were resoundingly clear: 

1. everyone is extremely excited about Prisma Postgres, and 
2. our pricing structure could be simpler.

We heard you. To address the pricing topic, we’re going to make it simple: **Prisma Postgres will be 100% free to use during the early access period!**

Our goals with Prisma Postgres are to make it seamless, enjoyable, and easy to get a database — instantly. Pricing should not get in the way of you trying Prisma Postgres, joining the many users who are already loving it.

Once Prisma Postgres is ready for General Access (GA) in early 2025 (with many more features and production-ready scaling) we will introduce a pricing model that is easy and makes sense.

Releasing a product in Early Access (EA) is all about feedback and learning from you. We thank you for sharing your feedback. If you have more feedback related to Prisma Postgres, please [fill this form](https://pris.ly/ppg-feedback) or find us on Twitter! Your input helps us shape the next version of the product.
