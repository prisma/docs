## Announcing: Vercel Marketplace integration for Prisma Postgres

Prisma Postgres is the world's first serverless database without cold starts. It's built on a [highly-efficient unikernel architecture](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-postgres-early-access), runs on bare metal for optimal speed, and also comes with built-in connection pooling, a global cache and a first-class integration with the type-safe Prisma ORM for an amazing DX.

Designed for serverless and Edge environments, it's the perfect database companion for your apps hosted on Vercel! With our new Vercel Marketplace integration, you can provision and manage your Prisma Postgres instances directly from your Vercel Dashboard.

[Deploy Next.js with Prisma Postgres](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/prisma-postgres)

## Connect Vercel apps to Prisma Postgres with ease

Vercel Marketplace is the easiest way to add additional infrastructure and other capabilities to your applications that are deployed via Vercel.

With the new Prisma Postgres integration, you can:

- create Prisma Postgres instances without leaving the Vercel Dashboard
- manage your Prisma Postgres billing inside your Vercel account
- connect Prisma Postgres instances to your apps with a single click

## Deploy our Next.js starter template now

To get you started, we have built a [starter template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/prisma-postgres) for you that can deploy with a single-click.

The template uses the new Prisma Postgres integration, so that you can simply create a free Prisma Postgres instance during the deployment flow and your application immediately connects to a database once it's live!

Here is what you get with our starter template:

- Next.js 15 app with App Router, Server Actions & API Routes
- Data modeling, database migrations, seeding & querying
- Log in and sign up authentication flows via [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- CRUD operations to create, view and delete database records
- Pagination, filtering & relations queries

## What integration would you like to see next?

We are hard at working bringing Prisma Postgres to your favorite environments. After [integrations for Netlify and Google's Firebase Studio (previously called IDX)](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-postgres-now-in-your-favorite-environment), we are excited about this latest addition of Prisma Postgres to Vercel Marketplace.

Now we want to hear from you: Where else would you like to see a first-class integration of Prisma Postgres? Let us know on [X](https://pris.ly/x?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=vercel-marketplace-launch) or our [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=vercel-marketplace-launch) so we can help you bring Prisma Postgres to your favorite environment!
