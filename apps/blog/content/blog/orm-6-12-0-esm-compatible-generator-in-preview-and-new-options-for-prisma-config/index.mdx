## Prisma ORM v6.12.0

Yesterday, we released Prisma ORM [v6.12.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.12.0) with some exciting updates!

### ESM-compatible `prisma-client` generator now in Preview

We're excited to share that our new and more flexible [`prisma-client`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators#prisma-client-early-access) generator is moving into [Preview](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/releases#preview)! 

This new generator is ESM-compatible, customizable for various JS runtimes (like Bun, Deno, CF Workers, …) and gives application developers more control over the generated code.

As a reminder, here's what it looks like:

```prisma
generator client {
  // Required
  provider = "prisma-client" // no `-js` at the end!
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma"

  // Optional
  runtime                = "nodejs"
  moduleFormat           = "esm"
  generatedFileExtension = "ts"
  importFileExtension    = "ts"
}
```
This new generator eliminates any headaches that you may have experienced due to [magical code generation into `node_modules`](https://www.prisma.io/blog/why-prisma-orm-generates-code-into-node-modules-and-why-it-ll-change). With it moving into Preview, we hope that even more of you will try it out and share your feedback with us! 

> **Note**: The `prisma-client` generator will become the default in Prisma v7, replacing the current `prisma-client-js` generator.

In addition to moving it into Preview, we also created a couple of new ready-to-run examples to help you get started with the new generator and your favorite framework:

- [React Router + Vite + Cloudflare](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client/react-router-starter-cloudflare-workerd)
- [React Router + Vite + Node.js](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client/react-router-starter-nodejs)
- [Nuxt 3 + Vite + Nitro](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client/nuxt3-starter-nodejs)
- [Deno Deploy](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client/deno-deploy)

### Specify locations for `views`, `migrations` and `typedSql` in Prisma Config (Early Access)

The [`prisma.config.ts`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference) file gives you a TypeScript-native way for configuring your Prisma project. It's convenient in situations when you want to customize the locations of your Prisma schema or use specific driver adapters for Prisma Migrate or Prisma Studio.

As we're getting closer to its [General Availability](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/releases#generally-available-ga) release, we're adding more capabilities to it! 

In previous versions, the Prisma CLI implicitly used to infer the location for migration, SQL view definition and [TypedSQL query](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/typedsql) files based on the location of the Prisma schema. In this release, we're adding three new fields (`migrations`, `views` and `typedSql`) to give you more flexibility and clarity on how the Prisma CLI should locate these files:

```ts
// prisma.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  earlyAccess: true,
  migrations: {
    path: './db/migrations'
  },
  views: {
    path: './db/views'
  },
  typedSql: {
    path:  './db/queries'
  }
  // ...
})
```
## Try out the new features & share your feedback

This week, we released several new features for Prisma ORM!  Try the new `prisma-client` generator [examples](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client) and the new options for `prisma.config.ts`, we'd love to hear how you like them.

Join the discussion on [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord), and ping us on [X](https://pris.ly/x) with your thoughts.
