[Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate) has transitioned from Early Access to public Preview! Now you can leverage the power of a managed global cache and connection pool with Prisma with support for 300  locations globally and use a connection pool with support for 16 regions.

## Cache query results close to your servers

Accelerate ensures that cached query results are always served from the nearest cache node to the application server, resulting in faster response times. Accelerate's cache nodes are built with Cloudflare and are available in 300 locations worldwide.

This greatly benefits distributed, serverless, and edge applications as performance remains consistent regardless of the application server's location. This is because a cache node is always available closest to the application server, and when data is cached, large round trips to the database are avoided.

Suppose a database is located in North America, and a request is made to the database from a server in Japan. By using Accelerate to cache query results, the results can be retrieved from a cache in the same region of Japan, avoiding a round trip of about ~16,000 kilometers (considering the speed of light, there would be an additional latency of approximately 53 milliseconds) to fetch query results from the database in North America.

### Programmatic control over cache behavior

Accelerate extends your Prisma Client with an intuitive API offering granular control over established caching patterns on a per-query basis. Utilise [time-to-live](https://www.prisma.io/docs/data-platform/accelerate/concepts#time-to-live-ttl) (TTL) or [state-while-revalidate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/data-platform/accelerate/concepts#stale-while-revalidate-swr) (SWR) to fine-tune your cache behavior tailored to your application needs.



```javascript
await prisma.user.findMany({
  cacheStrategy: {
+    ttl: 60,
  },
});
```
```javascript
await prisma.user.findMany({
  cacheStrategy: {
+    swr: 30,
  },
});
```
```javascript
await prisma.user.findMany({
  cacheStrategy: {
+    ttl: 60,
+    swr: 30,
  },
});
```

To comply with regulations regarding the storage of personally identifiable information (PII) like phone numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers, you may need to avoid caching query results. Excluding the `cacheStrategy` from your queries provides a straightforward way to opt out of caching your query results.

> To understand the advantages and drawbacks associated with caching database query results, read the blog post <a href="https://www.prisma.io/blog/benefits-and-challenges-of-caching-database-query-results-x2s9ei21e8kq"   target="_blank">Database Caching: A Double-Edged Sword? Examining the Pros and Cons</a>.

## Supercharge serverless and edge apps with Accelerate's connection pool

Accelerate seamlessly integrates with serverless and edge environments. While database connections are stateful, serverless and edge environments are stateless, making it challenging to manage stateful connections from a stateless environment.

In serverless environments, a sudden surge in traffic can spawn several ephemeral servers (also referred to as ‘serverless functions’) to handle requests. This results in each server opening up one or more database connections, eventually exceeding the database connection limit.

Accelerate's built-in connection pool can be deployed in the same region as your database. The connection pool helps you scale your application by persisting and reusing database connections, preventing the connection limit from being exceeded.

## Boost your app performance and scalability

Accelerate caches query results with incredible efficiency, allowing for lightning-fast retrieval of cached data with latencies as low as 5ms. The significant speedup provided by Accelerate is most noticeable when the results of complex, long-running queries are cached.

For example, a query that usually takes 30 seconds to process can be cached with Accelerate, resulting in a response time of approximately 5-20 milliseconds, providing a massive ~1000x speedup.

Accelerate enables you to serve more users with fewer resources. Storing frequently accessed query results reduces the need for repeated database queries. This improves scalability and performance by freeing up the database to perform more tasks. Application servers can handle more requests if query results are cached because the queries respond faster. This can help accelerate your website's response times.
