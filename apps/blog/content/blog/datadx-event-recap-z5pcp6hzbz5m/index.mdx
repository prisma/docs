Software development is now accessible to a wider audience, yet the data complexity when building applications has grown. These shifts highlight the need for simpler and more intuitive tools that empower developers to focus on the applications they want to build.  

The new [Data DX](https://www.datadx.io/) category embodies this vision to simplify data-driven application development without sacrificing depth or functionality.

### Bringing the industry together
Prisma's Discover Data DX event showcased the role of Data DX as a unifying concept. It was inspiring to see varied companies embrace Data DX's principles. Together, they explored its meaning and how collaborative efforts could enhance the developer experience significantly.

## The future of building data-driven apps
The second segment focused on the evolution of developer experience in data-driven application development, with representatives from Grafbase, Tinybird, RedwoodJS and Prisma sharing diverse perspectives. 

### The crucial role of developer experience

High-quality developer experience is fundamental to the future of application development. The panel specifically discussed reducing repetitive tasks, automating workflows, and integrating tools and platforms effectively.

The consensus was that modern tools should significantly **reduce time to market**, enabling developers to concentrate on product development rather than infrastructure.

The discussion highlighted the gap in tooling quality between front-end and back-end development, especially in data management. Beyond pure scalability, the industry is now shifting to prioritize ease of use and developer experience in back-end and data tools.

The panel also touched on AI's potential in application development, with Tinybird experimenting in this area, noting the need for human oversight.
