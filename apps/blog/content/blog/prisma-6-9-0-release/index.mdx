### TL;DR: The Rust-Free ORM is ready for production-use

Prisma ORM's core engine has undergone a major shift from the **Rust based query engine** to a leaner **TypeScript/WASM core** (the **Query Compiler**). This [new architecture is now **production-ready** (v6.16+)](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.16.0) and fundamentally improves your developer experience (DX) and application performance.

- **No binary overhead:** The dependency on native Rust binaries is eliminated, drastically simplifying deployment and reducing potential complexity issues.
- **Performance:** Get **up to 3.4x faster queries** (by removing cross-language serialization) and a **90% smaller bundle size** (from ~14MB to 1.6 MB).
- **Better support for different runtimes:** Enables better support for deployement environments and runtimes like Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, Vercel Edge and more.

To implement these benefits now, see the [official usage guide for the new Rust-Free ORM](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine). You can also follow the entire development and release history in our **[Prisma ORM: The Complete Rust-to-TypeScript Migration Journey](https://www.prisma.io/blog/series/prisma-orm-the-complete-rust-to-typescript-migration-journey)** blog series**.**

## Prisma ORM without Rust engines for PostgreSQL & SQLite (Preview)

In case you missed it, we’ve been working on a major shift in how Prisma ORM works under the hood. We’re gradually replacing the Rust-based query engine with a TypeScript-based architecture. [Here’s the full story](https://www.prisma.io/blog/try-the-new-rust-free-version-of-prisma-orm-early-access).

This change removes the need for binary targets, avoids native build issues, and makes Prisma ORM easier to run in environments like Bun, Deno, serverless, and edge functions. It also improves performance by skipping serialization between Rust and JavaScript.

The Rust-free version of Prisma ORM is now in [**Preview** for PostgreSQL & SQLite](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/releases#preview). If you held off during [Early Access](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/releases#early-access), this is a good time to try it out. Other databases will be supported in future releases.

To get started with the Query Compiler and PostgreSQL, enable the `queryCompiler` and `driverAdapters` preview features in your generator:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["queryCompiler", "driverAdapters"]
  output          = "../generated/prisma"
}
```
Then generate Prisma Client using `prisma generate`  and install the [driver adapter](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) for PostgreSQL:

```shell
npm install @prisma/adapter-pg
```
Now instantiate `PrismaClient` with the adapter:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma'
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: env.DATABASE_URL })
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```
That’s it! You're now using Prisma ORM without any Rust engines in PostgreSQL. With this preview feature, you no longer need to worry about query engines or binary targets. [Learn more about the feature in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine).

## Major improvements for local Prisma Postgres (Preview)

In [the 6.8.0 release](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-6-8-0-release#local-development-for-prisma-postgres-early-access), we introduced `prisma dev`, a simple command to run Prisma Postgres locally. Local Prisma Postgres uses PGlite under the hood and gives you the same experience as a remote Prisma Postgres instance.

This release brings key upgrades:

- `prisma init` now sets the local Prisma Postgres connection string by default, replacing the old placeholder URL
- Data now persists between `prisma dev` sessions, so you can pick up coding sessions where you left off
- You can run multiple local instances at once, perfect for parallel testing or multi-project workflows

It’s a great fit for building features offline, testing in isolation, and starting projects instantly.

## Connect to Prisma Postgres with any tool (Preview)

Prisma Postgres started as a dedicated database experience for developers using Prisma ORM. With typed queries, accelerated performance, schema integration, and query optimization features, it offered a deeply optimized setup for Prisma ORM users. But if you weren’t using Prisma ORM, you couldn’t use Prisma Postgres.

*That changes now.*

Prisma Postgres now works with any tool. You can connect using Drizzle, Kysely, TypeORM, `psql`, or **any** **other** Postgres-compatible library, database migration [tools like Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/) or interfaces like DBeaver, Postico, and more.


![Diagram showing different ORMs and tools like Drizzle, TypeORM, Prisma, Kysely, and others connecting to Prisma Postgres.](/blog/prisma-6-9-0-release/imgs/11bbf684b79e48e6d1e838f04d9c3908c14f8373-2470x1030.png)

This opens up new workflows. You can plug Prisma Postgres into existing projects without rewriting your query layer. You can experiment with different query builders. You can drop into the CLI, automate migrations, run analytics jobs, or connect from multiple runtimes. Whatever fits your stack.

It’s still the same fast, scalable, serverless Postgres under the hood. You just get to use it your way.

[See how to connect to Prisma Postgres with any tool](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/direct-connections?utm_source=blog&utm_content=cta_button)

But what if you just want a lightweight way to send raw SQL over HTTP?

*We’ve got you covered.*

### Use our *new* serverless driver for Prisma Postgres (Early Access)

You can now use the [`@prisma/ppg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/ppg) driver, currently in Early Access, to connect to Prisma Postgres over HTTP. 

This driver allows you to write raw SQL, does not require Prisma ORM and is also designed for platforms that do not support long-lived TCP database connections.

```ts
import { ppg } from "@prisma/ppg";

type Post = {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  content: string | null;
  published: boolean;
  authorId: number | null;
}

const sql = ppg("prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=...");

const authorId = 1;
const posts = await sql<Post>`SELECT * FROM "Post" WHERE "authorId" = ${authorId}`;
```
This is ideal for runtimes like **v0**, **Bolt**, **Cloudflare Workers**, **AWS Lambda**, and **Vercel Edge Functions**, where traditional Postgres drivers that rely on TCP connections often can’t be used, and you don't want to use Prisma ORM.

With no engines, no binaries, and no Prisma Client involved, it gives you raw SQL access to Prisma Postgres through a simple HTTP interface. [Learn how to use the serverless driver.](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/serverless-driver)

## Use the new embedded database editor in VS Code to manage Prisma Postgres

If you use Prisma ORM, there's a good chance you already have the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) installed and that you've also already tried Prisma Studio. The latest update introduces two major features: manage Prisma Postgres databases, and use PrisStudio directly in VS Code.

![VS Code interface displaying Prisma Studio with options to browse and edit local and remote Prisma Postgres databases, including a table view of Post data.](/blog/prisma-6-9-0-release/imgs/f7a4f862f7f12d96c98eafef1b6bf0f2d0cac943-3740x1964.png)


With the new features, you can do the following directly from VS Code:
- Authenticate with the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io/)
- Create and delete remote Prisma Postgres instances
- View and connect to local Prisma Postgres instances
- View and edit data using an embedded Prisma Studio
- Visualize your database schema

If you already have the extension, look for the new Prisma icon in your Activity Bar. Learn more [in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/integrations/vscode-extension#database-management-ui).

## Easily restore backups of your Prisma Postgres database

To restore a previous backup of your Prisma Postgres database instance, you had to ping our support team. That's not what you want to do when you've made a mistake and just want to roll back. Now, restoring backup snapshots is just a few clicks away. In the Prisma Console, you’ll now find a **Backups** tab when viewing a database.

![Prisma Console interface showing the backup tab for a Prisma Postgres database instance, with options to view and restore completed backup snapshots.](/blog/prisma-6-9-0-release/imgs/1c1347e1e24b43ebe2bc1134b8a6fe4ce1bc20b6-3304x1216.png)

From there, you can:

- Browse available backups
- Choose a snapshot
- Restore your database to that snapshot

This makes it easy to recover from accidental changes or test rollback scenarios in development. Snapshots are taken at regular intervals based on the plan you're on, so make sure you check that out if backups are important for you.

📚 Learn more about [backups and restoring them in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/backups).
