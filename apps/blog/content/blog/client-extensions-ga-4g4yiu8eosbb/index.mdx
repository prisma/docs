    With the release of version [4.16.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/4.16.0) of the Prisma ORM, [Client extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions) are now Generally Available! This new feature allows users to extend and customize Prisma Client to meet their individual use cases.

## Tailor Prisma Client to meet your codebase's needs

In [4.7.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/4.7.0), we released Prisma Client extensions [as a Preview feature](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/releases#preview). Today we are happy to announce the General Availability of Prisma Client extensions! Extensions have proven to be extremely useful and powerful during the Preview period, even powering Prisma products like [Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate) and [Optimize](https://www.prisma.io/docs/optimize)!

### A straightforward and easy to use API

If this is the first time you're hearing about Client extensions, don't worry. We have [an existing blog post](/client-extensions-preview-8t3w27xkrxxn) that covers the usage in-depth. To sum it up here: creating an extension is as easy as using `$extends`.

This code snippet shows how you can add a _new method_ to the `User` model using a [`model`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions/model) extension:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  model: {
    user: {
      async signUp(email: string) { 
        // code for the new method goes inside the brackets
      }, 
    },
  },
});

// The new method can then be used like this:

const newUser = await prisma.user.signUp('myemail@email.com');
```
If you instead require a method on _all models_, you can even use the builtin `$allModels` feature:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  model: {
    $allModels: {
      async exists<T>(
        this: T,
        where: Prisma.Args<T, 'findFirst'>['where']
      ): Promise<boolean> {
        // code for the new method goes inside the brackets
      },
    },
  },
});

// You can now invoke `exists` on any of your models. For example:

const postExists = await prisma.post.exists({ id: 1 });
```
For a more in-depth look into changes we made to the extensions API as a part of this release, please check out [our release notes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/4.16.0)

### Extensions built by the community

While client extensions are now generally available, we have already seen some cool examples in the wild. [`prisma-extension-pagination`](https://github.com/deptyped/prisma-extension-pagination) is an awesome contribution from our community. Importing and using an external client extension is easy too:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import pagination from 'prisma-extension-pagination';

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(pagination);

const [users, meta] = prisma.user
  .paginate({
    select: {
      id: true,
    }
  })
  .withPages({
    limit: 10,
  });
```
### Reference examples for various use cases

In addition to community contributions, we have a set of reference examples in the [`prisma-client-extensions` example repository](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-extensions) that showcase different areas where we believe Prisma Client extensions can be useful. The repository currently contains the following example extensions:
