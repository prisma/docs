  Deno Deploy’s integration with Prisma Postgres enables seamless full-stack deployment. Each Git branch gets its own database via the Prisma Management API, allowing developers to preview, test, and ship changes faster without managing infrastructure. Built through the Prisma Partner Program.

## A partner integration that makes full-stack deployment truly seamless

[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) helps developers ship modern JavaScript and TypeScript applications quickly, without the complexity of traditional infrastructure. With version 2, Deno introduced the concept of [**timelines**](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/reference/timelines/), where every Git branch creates an isolated environment with its own runtime, URL, and configuration. This model enables developers to preview and test changes in isolation, improving confidence and velocity.

To support these per-branch environments, Deno needed a flexible and fast way to handle databases. That’s where [**Prisma Postgres**](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) came in.

By partnering with Prisma, Deno integrated native database provisioning into their platform. Developers can now spin up a Postgres database for each branch from directly within Deno Deploy, using [Prisma’s Management API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/introduction/management-api). There’s no need for external dashboards or manual setup. Databases just work.

## A Natural Fit for Modern Developer Workflows

Deno’s timeline-based model demands more than just a generic database connection. It requires rapid provisioning, predictable pricing, and easy integration with modern developer tools.

Prisma Postgres checked every box. It runs on bare metal, supports serverless workloads with no cold starts, and uses a usage-based pricing model that fits perfectly with per-branch deploys. Through the Prisma Management API, Deno provisions a new project and database for each timeline, configures the correct environment variables, and assigns the database to the application automatically.

> “We want to ensure the development flow isn’t hindered by the platform,” said Arnau Orriols, Engineer at Deno. “With per-branch databases, developers can safely test migrations and isolate changes. Prisma made it easy to support that.”

## Built Together Through Partnership

This integration was made possible through [Prisma’s **Partner Program**](https://www.prisma.io/partners), which gives platform teams early access to provisioning tools, dedicated technical guidance, and co-marketing opportunities.

Prisma worked closely with Deno throughout the process, helping them implement the Management API, answer technical questions, and deliver a smooth developer experience from day one.

> “The provisioning experience was smooth and fast. Prisma was very responsive and helped us unlock this integration quickly,” said Orriols.

The collaboration is a great example of how the Partner Program helps developer-focused companies bring powerful new capabilities into their platforms, without taking on the full burden of database infrastructure.

## Why Prisma Postgres

Deno needed more than a database provider. They needed a solution that matched their product philosophy: fast, simple, and built for developers. Prisma Postgres delivered that, with:

* **Fast provisioning via API** to match timeline creation

* **Cold-start-free performance** on bare metal

* **Usage-based pricing** that fits scale-to-zero workflows

* **A clean abstraction** that lets developers focus on building, not configuring

The result is a database layer that feels as modern and thoughtful as the rest of Deno Deploy.

## Available Today, and Built to Grow

The Deno Deploy and Prisma Postgres integration is live for users, and the underlying model is now proven. Other platforms looking to offer database provisioning, improve developer workflows, or reduce infrastructure overhead can follow the same path through Prisma’s Partner Program.

Whether you’re building an internal platform, a commercial tool, or a hosting service, Prisma Postgres can help you deliver the kind of experience modern developers expect.
