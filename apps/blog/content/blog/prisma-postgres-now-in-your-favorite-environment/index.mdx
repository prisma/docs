Prisma Postgres is the first serverless database without cold starts. It was designed from first principles, is built on unikernels and runs on bare metal infrastructure for high-performance workloads. 

Check out our General Availability announcement to learn about the architecture, features, and benefits Prisma Postgres provides: [Prisma Postgres: The Future of Serverless Databases](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-postgres-the-future-of-serverless-databases). Or watch our explainer video: [Prisma Postgres in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lImlEhlxxio).

## Integrated in your favorite environments

While we are excited that Prisma Postgres is now ready for mission-critical projects, we don't want to stop here! 

We want to make it as easy as possible for you to use Prisma Postres with _your_ favorite environments, cloud providers, or any other tools you're excited about.

Today, we're sharing the first steps into that direction: first-class integrations with Netlify and Project IDX. And there's a lot more to come!

## Easily add Prisma Postgres to Netlify sites

The [Prisma Postgres extension for Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/integrations/prisma) is the easiest way for developers who are hosting on Netlify to add a PostgreSQL database to their apps.

The Netlify extension for Prisma Postgres enables developers to connect their Prisma Postgres instances to the environments of their Netlify sites directly in the Netlify Dashboard. 

Here's a high-level overview of how to use it:

1. Install the extension in your Netlify team
2. Add the integration token from the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io)
3. Create a new Prisma Postgres instance
4. Connect your site to the Prisma Postgres instance right from the Netlify Dashboard

Here's a quick rundown of using the extension and deploying a Next.js site with it:

## Try out Prisma Postgres in your browser using Project IDX

Project IDX is an amazing and developer-friendly IDE that runs entirely in your browser! It's built by the folks at Google and provides a quick and easy way to try out any new technology.

We've teamed up with the folks at Project IDX and created an official Prisma Postgres template that walks you through the main features of Prisma Postgres, such as:

- Data modeling and migrations
- CRUD queries from a TypeScript app
- Using the global cache

When you use the template, you'll be presented with a README file with all the setup instructions for you to get going!

## Coming soon: Prisma Postgres on Vercel Marketplace

We're also working on making it possible to use Prisma Postgres via the Vercel Marketplace. This will allow you to spin up a Prisma Postgres instance without leaving your Vercel Dashboard and automatically connect it your deployed applications!

## What's next?

We're excited to see what you'll build with these integrations! Let us know on [X](https://pris.ly/x) or [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord) what other tools, environments, or platforms you'd like to see Prisma Postgres integrated with.
