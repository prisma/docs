excerpt: |
  Prisma Studio is used and loved by thousands of developers but it hasn’t changed much since its initial release. We’ve just launched some great new DX improvements to Prisma Studio and it’s now fully available within the Prisma Data Platform.
---

Prisma’s mission is to enable developers to work with their data effectively and make it easier to do so. One thing we’ve found to be true is that even the most low-level-loving developers want a quick and easy way to work with their data in an interface that is fast, intuitive, and capable.

To help solve this, we released Prisma Studio relatively early on in Prisma’s evolution, going back to 2020. At this point, Prisma Studio was imagined as a “modern day phpMyAdmin”—a way for developers to view and edit data for any environment, right in their browser.

In the time between then and now, Prisma Studio has seen huge (and increasing) usage. However, it hasn’t received the kinds of refinements that many developers would expect to see. We’re changing that starting today. Your beloved Prisma Studio will now get the continued love and attention that it demands and deserves.

Today we’re excited to share what's new in  Prisma Studio: 

- Prisma Studio is available in the Prisma Data Platform for all Postgres and MySQL databases
- Prisma Studio has received some DX upgrades based on community feedback

## Prisma Studio in the Prisma Data Platform

Since launching Prisma Postgres in early access, it became clear that developers want to view their data in the same place they manage their deployed databases. That’s why we decided to embed Prisma Studio directly into the Prisma Data Platform.

If you’ve got an existing Prisma Data Platform project, you can go ahead and view your data in the Studio tab.

Don’t have a database? You can deploy a free [Prisma Postgres](https://pris.ly/ppg) database in three clicks (two minutes).

This is also a great way to see Prisma Studio in action directly in the Prisma Data Platform 👀

A few quick steps 👇

1. Head over to [console.prisma.io](https://console.prisma.io)
2. Click "New project" and give it a name
3. Select Prisma Postgres and hit "Create project"

Having access to your data through the browser against your Prisma Postgres databases gives you the opportunity to query and modify your data without needing to run anything locally. 

Prisma Studio in the console isn’t just for Prisma Postgres. If you happen to be using the Prisma Data Platform with a different database provider or database type, you can use Prisma Studio against that database in just the same way.

## DX improvements in Prisma Studio

If you’ve been using Prisma for a while, you might have noticed that Prisma Studio hasn’t changed a whole lot over time. The UI that you’ve seen up to today is one that’s been around for years now.

We’ve heard from the community that certain touchpoints in Prisma Studio are worth revisiting to make it easier for developers to get their work done. To that end, we’re excited to share several new features in Prisma Studio that will make your life easier!

### **A new way to view models**

If you’re viewing and editing data between different models in Prisma Studio, you’ve probably experienced needing to go back to the main models list, taking you out of context for the current model you’re working on. We’ve rearranged the UI so that your list of models now opens as a sidebar from the left side. This allows you to stay in flow while searching for the next model you want to work on.

### **Editing your rows is now easier**

Making edits to a record can be cumbersome when the number of fields gets large and you need to do a lot of left-to-right scrolling. To help ease this, we’ve enabled a new feature which allows you to open a record in a sidebar from the right side to make your edits. We’ve also added in some nice features like a calendar picker for dates.

You can still edit data inline like you’re used to but you now have more options for making changes to your records in a more user friendly way.

### **Closing tabs is just a single click**

There’s a good chance that your Prisma Studio session has just as many tabs open as your browser. Closing them one-by-one is a pain. 

To help solve this, we’ve got a new control which allows you to close all open tabs with a single click. This is perfect for situations where you’re either done working with Studio for a while or you just want to get back to a clean slate.

## What would you like to see in Prisma Studio?

These new upgrades to Prisma Studio are just a starting point. There will be more features to come.

While these updates enhance Prisma Studio's core experience, we're proud of the features our users already know and love - particularly our robust handling of relational data. Whether you're viewing nested relations, modifying connected records, or navigating complex data relationships, Studio has made these workflows intuitive and accessible. Now we're eager to build on this foundation. Whether it's expanding our relational features further, adding new visualization options, or introducing entirely new capabilities, we want to hear how Studio can better serve your needs!

Are there any other improvements in Prisma Studio you would like to see? What would make for a better developer experience for you or make you more productive?

Also, is there anywhere else you’d like to see Prisma Studio embedded? Let us know which platforms you are deploying Prisma to and we’ll see if there’s any opportunity to have an embedded version in that provider.
