## Adding MongoDB support to Prisma

MongoDB has been [our most requested feature since the release of Prisma 2](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1277). Today we're thrilled to announce Preview support for MongoDB in Prisma! 🎉

Earlier this year, we released an Early Access of the MongoDB connector to Prisma Client. Since then, hundreds of engineers signed up for the Early Access program and provided us with helpful feedback.

This release marks a significant milestone in bringing the benefits of Prisma to more developers by adding support for MongoDB.

MongoDB support has passed rigorous testing internally and by the Early Access participants and is now ready for broader testing by the community. **However, as a Preview feature, it is not production-ready.** To read more about what preview means, check out the [maturity levels](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/releases#preview) in the Prisma docs.

Thus, we're inviting the MongoDB community to try it out and [give us feedback](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/8241) so we can bring MongoDB support to general availability. 🚀


## Making MongoDB type safe with Prisma

Unlike the already supported SQL databases in Prisma, [MongoDB](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/mongodb) is a NoSQL database that makes different assumptions about how to model your data and how you query it.

MongoDB's collections, by default, do not require their documents to have the same schema. While this is one of the benefits of MongoDB, it comes at a cost – as a developer, you have the burden of ensuring the consistency and integrity of your data.

For example, documents in a single collection do not need to have the same set of fields and can have different types for the same field. As your application and data model evolve and you add new fields, it is up to you to manage the complexity of all possible variants of a document in the application layer.

Prisma addresses the challenges of a dynamic schema by allowing you to **define** and **enforce** a schema.

You define your data model using [Prisma Schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema) – Prisma's declarative data modeling language.

After defining your Prisma schema, you auto-generate the TypeScript Prisma Client and use it in your application to interact with the database with type safety for all queries. Prisma Client leverages TypeScript's type system to map your Prisma schema models to types, so for every query you write, the exact return type is inferred.

## Getting started

This release allows you to use Prisma Client in new MongoDB projects.

To get started with MongoDB, check out the [**Start from scratch guide**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/mongodb-typescript-mongodb) in the docs.

If you prefer a guided video, check out the [**MongoDB with Prisma**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4nxOv91vWI) video.

You can also dig into our ready-to-run [example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/databases/mongodb) in the [`prisma-examples`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples) repo which includes instructions on how to start a MongoDB server locally and some example scripts to demonstrate Prisma Client queries.

## Limitations

Support for MongoDB comes with some limitations that are detailed in this section.

- [MongoDB replica set is required for transactions](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/8266)
- [Prisma Migrate is not supported yet](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7305)
- [Introspection is not supported](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6787)
- [Unique indices need to be created manually](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6727)
- [Limited support for embedded documents (currently only possible with the Json type)](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6708)
