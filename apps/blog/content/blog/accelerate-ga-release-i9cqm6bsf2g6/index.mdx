## Prisma Accelerate in Production
To see what Prisma Accelerate can do, let's take a look at its implementation in two real-world cases:

### Cal.com: Enhancing scheduling efficiency

[Cal.com](https://cal.com/), a popular open-source scheduling platform, provides appointment bookings for a diverse range of users. Given the high frequency of appointments scheduled every minute, they recognized the importance of swift database access in delivering the best user experience, especially during peak times.

Prisma Accelerate's robust connection pooling is designed to handle high volumes of database interactions efficiently. For platforms like Cal.com, this means over 4M queries every day to enable seamless management of appointments, even with heavy traffic peaks.

[Formbricks](https://formbricks.com/), an open-source experience management platform, streamlines user interactions, understanding their sentiments toward products. As a tool that facilitates real-time insights through surveys and feedback, swift and reliable database interactions are crucial.

Leveraging Prisma Accelerate's connection pooling, Formbricks achieves seamless and rapid data access, with high-traffic peaking at 7M queries in a 24-hour time period. This allows them to maintain consistent performance, even when faced with unpredictable user traffic, ensuring a smooth experience for all their users.
