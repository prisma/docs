Behind the scenes, SiteGPT is ingesting and processing massive volumes of data daily and it all runs on **Prisma Postgres**.

<Quotes 
speakerName="Bhanu Teja, Founder">
“Once I started using Prisma Postgres, everything just worked. It was smooth, and it felt closer to what I wanted than anything else I tested.” 
</Quotes>

Here’s how Prisma Postgres delivered the performance, simplicity, and developer experience SiteGPT needed to scale confidently.

## From uncertainty to simplicity

Tired of unexpected downtimes and feature shutdowns, when SiteGPT began searching for a new database platform, Bhanu faced common challenges: unpredictable costs, provisioning complexity, and unwanted DevOps responsibilities.

<Quotes 
speakerName="Bhanu">
“With most databases, I had to make decisions I didn’t want to deal with. What size? How many read replicas? What happens at scale? I don’t want to manage that.”
</Quotes>

Prisma Postgres solved these issues for Bhanu's team by removing manual capacity planning, cutting DevOps overhead, and offering [usage-based pricing](https://www.prisma.io/blog/operations-based-billing) that scales with demand, **not guesswork**.

## Why Prisma Postgres was the right fit

### 1. Transparent, usage-based Pricing

<Quotes 
speakerName="Bhanu">
“One thing I really like about Prisma Postgres is the pricing model. I just query what I need, and I pay for what I use.”
</Quotes>

Instead of managing infrastructure or pre-selecting plans, SiteGPT pays based on operations, a model that aligns naturally with how AI platforms scale.

### 2. No server management required

The team has strong backend experience but zero interest in managing infrastructure.

Prisma Postgres abstracts away those headaches, letting builders focus on features, not fire drills.

### 3. Simple integration with Prisma ORM

Having used Prisma ORM previously, the decision to adopt Prisma Postgres was a no-brainer.

This tight integration means fewer moving parts, better DX, and faster development cycles.

### 4. Hands-on guidance during migration

When FaunaDB announced it was sunsetting its product, SiteGPT needed a reliable alternative. Prisma’s CEO, Søren, reached out directly and offered help migrating to Prisma Postgres, giving the team the confidence to make the switch.

<Quotes 
speakerName="Bhanu">
“Søren from the Prisma team messaged me directly and said, ‘We’ll help with the entire migration.’ That gave me the confidence to switch.” 
</Quotes>

Prisma’s team ensured the database was ready for production workloads, and helped make the migration from their previous setup fast and low-risk.

## Scaling to 10 Million+ database operations a day

SiteGPT’s growth has been impressive with customers syncing massive content libraries and AI models generating and updating vectors at scale.

<Quotes 
speakerName="Bhanu">
“We have e-commerce customers with 30,000+ pages. We process all of that, generate embeddings, and store the data. That’s why we generate over 8 million queries a day.”
</Quotes>


Prisma Postgres powers this workflow without slowdown, and SiteGPT plans to explore more Prisma features like [**built-in caching**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/caching) and [**Prisma Optimize**](https://www.prisma.io/optimize) as they continue to scale.

## Final thoughts

Prisma Postgres gave SiteGPT a fast, reliable, and developer-friendly database platform with a usage-based business model that made sense from day one.

<Quotes 
speakerName="Bhanu">
“The biggest thing for me was not having to make hard infrastructure choices. Prisma just lets me build.”
</Quotes>
