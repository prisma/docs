excerpt: |
  Ever wish you could spin up Prisma Postgres locally in seconds without accounts or Docker? With Prisma 6.8.0, just run `prisma dev` and dive straight into coding. We’ve also rolled in support for VS Code’s agent mode: which you can use to prompt and run migrations, provision production databases, and more without ever leaving your IDE.

## Local development for Prisma Postgres (Early Access)

**Testing your database shouldn’t depend on cloud access.**

When you’re building and testing, you want instant feedback. With **Prisma 6.8.0**, you can now spin up **Prisma Postgres locally** using:

```shell
npx prisma dev
```
This launches a **local Prisma Postgres instance**, fully isolated from your cloud environment. That means:

- **Zero latency** – Queries are local and instant.
- **Complete isolation** – Perfect for testing without touching production data.
- **Offline-ready** – You can work on flights, in tunnels, or anywhere without internet.
- **No account needed** – No need for an account to test and build during development.
- **No Docker under the hood** – Local Prisma Postgres is based on [PGLite](https://pglite.dev/), no Docker required.

Zero cloud dependencies! Just local, blazing-fast database development. 

[Visit our docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/local-development?utm_source=website&utm_content=release_blog) to learn how to start using Prisma Postgres locally.

## Manage your database right inside VS Code with agent mode

Have you ever set up a database from scratch and spent more time configuring it than building the feature you actually wanted to code?

***That should never be the case.*** 

With Prisma 6.8.0, you can use VS Code agent mode and simply ask Copilot to perform Prisma CLI commands for you. That simplifies database management, making it feel as natural as sending a quick message. 

Just type: *“Create a database for me and store the connection string in an* `.env` *file” …and it’s done.* No terminal hopping, no context switching.

Here’s what you can do right inside VS Code now:

- **Provision new Prisma Postgres instances:** Instantly create and configure databases without breaking focus.
- **Create and run migrations:** Apply your schema changes with a couple of commands—no separate CLI setup needed.
- **Check migration status:** Verify that every migration has been applied successfully at a glance.

If you’re already using the [Prisma VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma), you can try it out easily by:

1. Making sure you have [GitHub Copilot installed and enabled in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup).
2. Opening up **Copilot Chat** and switch to **Agent** mode.
3. Then asking the agent to create databases, run migrations, and more.

Here’s a simple demo:

![A screen-recording GIF of Visual Studio Code in a dark theme with a “prisma-agent-demo” project open. The VS Code sidebar shows project files on the right. The user opens the GitHub Copilot Chat pane, switches it to “Agent” mode, and types “Create a new database for me.” The Copilot agent runs Prisma CLI commands in the chat, provisions a new local Postgres database, writes the connection string into the .env file, and confirms success—all without leaving the editor.](/blog/prisma-6-8-0-release/imgs/65fe5d7ad676993c99bb97a938d501887f8cc957-800x450.gif)

You can [learn more about the VS Code agent in our docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/integrations/vscode-agent?utm_source=website&utm_content=release_blog).

## Query Prisma docs instantly with GitHub Copilot

You’re deep in code, writing a query, building a new model, testing out migrations. But then you pause...*What’s the syntax for that one-to-many relationship again?*

**Context switching kills momentum.**

With the **Prisma for GitHub Copilot** extension, you don’t have to leave your editor to find out. Just ask: “*@prisma-for-github-copilot How can I cache my prisma queries?”*

The answer appears right inside **GitHub Copilot Chat**. 

![A dark-themed GitHub Copilot Chat pane titled “Ask Copilot,” showing usage tips (“or type # to attach context,” “@ to chat with extensions,” “Type / to use commands”). In the bottom input box, the user types “@prisma How can I cache my prisma queries?” The Copilot Chat pane then displays a detailed reply explaining strategies for caching Prisma query results directly in code.](/blog/prisma-6-8-0-release/imgs/a7feebd273dadac60fbfc8dfd95fddd83fd28411-800x785.gif)

It’s not just documentation, it’s real-time guidance. No browser tabs. No lost focus.

- **Fast lookups:** Get the right answer immediately.
- **Stay in your flow:** No more jumping between documentation and the editor.
- **Boost productivity:** Spend more time coding, less time searching.

## Run Prisma with Deno (Preview)

With Prisma 6.8.0, **native Deno support** is here. If you’re working with Deno, the integration is simple:

```prisma
generator client {
-  provider = "prisma-client-js"
+  provider = "prisma-client"
   output   = "../src/generated/prisma"
+  runtime  = "deno"
}
```
No adapters, no custom builds—just Prisma ORM, running natively in Deno. Try it out by following the [step-by-step guide here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-deno-deploy).

## New Prisma Postgres region: Singapore

Expanding your database to the right region makes all the difference in latency and user experience. That’s why **Prisma Postgres** now supports deployments in the `ap-southeast-1` region—bringing faster data access across Southeast Asia.

And it wasn’t just our decision, *it was yours*. You voted and now Singapore is live.

<TweetEmbedComp tweets={["1920100310489747952"]} />

You can now deploy your Prisma Postgres instance in Singapore and bring your applications closer to your users.

## **Stay in the loop**

We’re working to build a more powerful developer experience with Prisma 6.8.0 and beyond. From local-first database development and real-time documentation lookups to edge-ready Deno deployments, it's all designed to keep you coding, *not configuring*.

But we’re not stopping here and working to build more integrations and better tooling. Want to stay ahead of the curve? [Follow us on X](https://pris.ly/x?utm_source=website) for updates, tips, and previews of what's next.
