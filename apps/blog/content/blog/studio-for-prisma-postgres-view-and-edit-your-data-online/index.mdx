## Prisma Studio: The easiest way to view and edit your data

[Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio) is a _database GUI_ that makes it easy to view and edit the data in your database. When using Prisma ORM, you can open it using the following command:
```
npx prisma studio
```
Traditional database GUIs can feel clunky and make the workflows for viewing and editing data more difficult than needed.

Prisma Studio provides a _modern_ user interface that makes data accessible to a technical and non-technical audience alike.

Some key features of Prisma Studio are:

- Perform **CRUD** operations on your data
- View and modify **relations** between records
- Add **filter** criteria to narrow down the list of records
- **Sort and paginate** the list of records
- **Hide columns** that are not relevant to your current goal

## Studio is coming to Platform Console for Prisma Postgres 🎉

Previously, Prisma Studio had only been available _locally_ when using Prisma ORM by running the `npx prisma studio` command. Now, Studio is available _online_ for your Prisma Postgres instances directly in [Console](https://console.prisma.io).

> In case you’ve missed it: [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-postgres-early-access) is our new database offering! It is based on a unikernel architecture and has unique benefits like zero cold starts, a generous free tier, out-of-the-box connection pooling, caching, real-time events and more. It’s completely free while it’s running in Early Access — [try it out now!](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart-prismaPostgres)

Simply navigate to the new **Studio** tab in the sidebar of your project environment and start exploring your data:

## Studio will soon be available for more databases

If you’re not using Prisma Postgres, don’t sweat — Prisma Studio is coming to Console for other databases soon!
