excerpt: |
  Apollo Client, a powerful and flexible GraphQL client library, just reached version 2.0. In this post, we want to
    highlight some of the major changes compared to the previous release.

## Simple modularity with Apollo Link

Probably the biggest change in Apollo Client 2.0 is the transition from using the concept of a _network interface_ to a more modular approach based on a new primitive: [Apollo Link](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link).

> Note: To learn more about the motivation behind Apollo Link, check out this article by [Evans Hauser](https://twitter.com/EvansHauser) who worked on Apollo Link as a summer intern: [Apollo Link: The modular GraphQL network stack](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/apollo-link-the-modular-graphql-network-stack-3b6d5fcf9244)

The now deprecated network interface used to enable your `ApolloClient` instance to send HTTP requests. It was also possible to hook into the process of preparing and sending the request (or processing the response) using the concept of _middleware_, e.g. for adding headers to the request.

Apollo Client 2.0 still is based on the idea of middleware — however, this middleware now actually is a first-class citizen and can be implemented using Apollo Link. For each task that you require for your networking stack (data validation, logging, caching,…) you can now write a dedicated `link` and simply add it to the _chain_ of middleware that’s invoked whenever you’re sending a request.

Here is what a simple implementation for a Link that’s making HTTP calls based on [`graphql-request`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-request) looks like:

```js
class GraphQLRequestLink extends ApolloLink {
  constructor({ endpoint, headers }) {
    super()
    this.client = new GraphQLClient(endpoint, { headers })
  }

  request(operation) {
    return new Observable(observer => {
      const { variables, query } = operation
      this.client
        .request(print(query), variables)
        .then(data => {
          observer.next(data)
          observer.complete()
        })
        .catch(e => {
          observer.error(e)
        })
    })
  }
}
```
There are already a number of officially supported links which you can simply pull into your application using npm. Here’s a quick overview over a few of them (see [here](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/tree/master/packages) for the full list):

- [`apollo-link-http`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/tree/master/packages/apollo-link-http): Used to send GraphQL operations over HTTP
- [`apollo-link-error`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/tree/master/packages/apollo-link-error): Used for custom error reporting (e.g. with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/))
- [`apollo-link-dedup`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/tree/master/packages/apollo-link-dedup): Deduplicated matching requests before sending them
- [`apollo-link-ws`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/tree/master/packages/apollo-link-ws): Used to send GraphQL operations over Websockets (often used for subscriptions)

## Observables instead of Promises

Another major change in going from 1.x to 2.0 is that [Observables](http://reactivex.io/intro.html) are replacing Promises as the core primitive for how data is processed.

> [At a basic level, a Link is a function that takes a (GraphQL) operation and returns an Observable.](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/overview.html#overview)

The biggest difference between Promises and Observables is that an **Observable represents a _stream_ of data** (meaning it can receive multiple values over time) while a **Promise only represents a single value** resulting from an asynchronous operation.

Observables emit events during their lifetime, there generally are three kinds of events:

- The **`next`** event carries the data the observers are interested in. This event can (but doesn’t have to) be emitted multiple times. For example, if an Observable represents a simple HTTP request, **`next`** will be emitted only once. If it represents mouse click events, it can emit any number of events until the Observable terminates.
- The **`error`** event indicates that an error occurred and terminates the Observable. Observers will receive some information that describes the error attached to the event.
- The **`completed`** event simply terminates the Observable and doesn’t carry any data.

This example from [Evans Hauser’s article](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/apollo-link-creating-your-custom-graphql-client-c865be0ce059) makes the role of these events clear:

```js
class CatchLink extends ApolloLink {
  request(operation, forward) {
    const observable = forward(operation)

    return new Observable(observer => {
      const subscription = observable.subscribe({
        next: observer.next.bind(observer),
        error: error => {
          // reroute errors as proper data
          observer.next({
            data: {
              error,
            },
          })
        },
        complete: observer.complete.bind(observer),
      })

      return () => {
        subscription.unsubscribe()
      }
    })
  }
}
```
The `CatchLink` intercepts any errors that are received from the API and places them in the `data` field of the GraphQL response, thus treating them as regular response data which are not terminating the Observable. In the case of `next` and `completed` events it simply forwards these to the observers.

The introduction of Observables opens the door to use links for implementing not only regular queries and mutations that follow the classic “request-response-cycle”, but also for subscriptions or live queries which continuously receive data from the server.

## New npm package structure

If you have used `react-apollo` before, you most likely know that it was the only dependency you had to install in your application to import anything you’d need from Apollo Client (except for subscriptions). A typical setup with `react-apollo` looked as follows:

```js
import { ApolloProvider, createNetworkInterface, ApolloClient } from 'react-apollo'

const networkInterface = createNetworkInterface({ uri })
const client = new ApolloClient({ networkInterface })

export default (
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>
)
```
Since one major theme of Apollo Client 2.0 is _modularity_, you now have to import your functionality from multiple individual packages:

```js
import { ApolloProvider } from 'react-apollo'
import { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-client'
import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-link-http'
import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory'

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: new HttpLink({ uri }),
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
})

export default (
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>
)
```
In order to send queries and mutations, you also need to explicitly install the [`graphql-tag`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag) and even [`graphql`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) libraries.

To offer some convenience when getting started, the Apollo team created the [`apollo-client-presets`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-client-preset) package which includes `apollo-client`, `apollo-cache-inmemory` and `apollo-link-http`. Read more about the installation in the [README](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client#installation).

## What’s next

Apollo Client is a community-driven effort and thanks to the new link concept, it’s possible to write dedicated pieces of functionality and share them with other developers. This enables different cache implementations (so you’re not depending on Redux any more when using Apollo Client), offline support, deferred queries and much more! Exciting times for GraphQL 💚
