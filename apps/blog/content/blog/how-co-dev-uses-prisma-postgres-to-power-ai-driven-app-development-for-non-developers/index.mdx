## Co.dev's mission: Turn prompts Into working apps

Co.dev is building for creators, founders, and entrepreneurs who don’t know how to code but want to launch apps. The AI agent takes a user’s natural language prompt and turns it into a complete application frontend, backend, and database.
To make that work behind the scenes, the Co.dev team needed a robust, reliable database layer with solid developer ergonomics and unit economics. That’s where Prisma Postgres stood out.

## Why Prisma Postgres became Co.dev’s preferred database integration

When Co.dev explored different solutions, Prisma Postgres quickly emerged as the most reliable and developer-friendly option especially compared to alternatives like Supabase and Neon.

### Easy Integration via the Prisma Partner API and first-class MCP support

Co.dev is one of the first platforms to use the Prisma Postgres Partner API, which enabled them to deeply integrate Prisma Postgres into their app creation flow. That integration also included support for Prisma Postgres through the our MCP server, allowing their AI agent to interact with Prisma in a well-integrated way.

“We collaborated closely with Prisma’s team during integration. They helped us resolve key friction points and improve the way our platform works for end users.”
</Quotes> 
				
This direct integration ensures that Prisma can be used easily within Co.dev’s AI-driven workflow with no extra setup or configuration needed from the user.

### A Schema that works for both humans and AI

Unlike other platforms that rely on implicit data models, Prisma uses an [explicit schema (schema.prisma)](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-schema-language-the-best-way-to-define-your-data) that defines the database structure in code.

<Quotes speakerImgLink="/blog/how-co-dev-uses-prisma-postgres-to-power-ai-driven-app-development-for-non-developers/imgs/0e1354fcf784282cfbf2048c499a4d5ff0c3446b-200x200.jpg"
speakerName="Andrew, co-founder of Co.dev">
“The schema file has been incredibly helpful. It lets our AI regenerate or revert apps and always reconnect with the correct database structure.”
</Quotes>
	
That schema-first design helps Co.dev deliver apps that are stable, easily versionable, and far less prone to breaking when changes are made, something that matters a lot to non-technical users who expect things to "just work."

### Authentication without workarounds

Authentication is a common friction point in AI-generated apps. Supabase required custom templates to make login flows function properly. Neon, when used with StackAuth (it's recommended method), introduced security limitations that broke login experiences inside iframe elements.

“With Prisma, we were able to get authentication working in one shot. That made it the clear choice.”
</Quotes>

## The result: A simpler, more stable app builder for everyone

Co.dev’s build flow includes three steps:

1. **Input a prompt** describing the app
2. **Select a database**, with Prisma Postgres offered as an option
3. **Add optional integrations** via other MCP servers


By choosing Prisma Postgres, users get a great Postgres database for their project with no configuration, a better developer experience, smoother authentication, and better handling of schema changes over time.

### A strong, collaborative partnership

Co.dev’s integration is part of our [Partner Program](https://www.prisma.io/partners), which helps platforms embed Prisma products in unique ways for a great user experience.
By working directly with Prisma, Co.dev didn’t just embed a tool, they built a foundation for scalable, AI-generated app development.

Build with Co.dev. Build with Prisma. If you’re building tools for developers or non-developers Prisma can help you deliver more consistent, scalable, and developer-friendly experiences.
