## Thank you for coming to our first conference!

A little under a month ago, on June 19th, we hosted our first [Prisma Day](https://www.prisma.io/day-2019), a conference on databases and modern app development with 150 attendees.

While we have hosted smaller events in the past, this was the first official Prisma conference, and we couldn't have asked for a better one! We want to give a huge thank you to everyone who came out to Berlin to join us and helped make it such a memorable experience.

The day featured thirteen talks that covered a variety of pressing topics in modern app development and wrapped up with a relaxed barbecue at the new Prisma office. It was an opportunity for the Prisma community to connect in person and learn more about each other's use cases, challenges, and experiences.

Additionally, Prisma Day came the day after the [Prisma 2 Preview release](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-2-zq1s745db8i5), on June 18th, which made Photon.js (a type-safe database client) and Lift (a declarative data modeling and migrations tool) available. Attendees at Prisma Day talks were the first to see live coding demos with Prisma 2 in action!
