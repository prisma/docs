  ## New features for Prisma Postgres

[Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) is the first serverless database with always-on performance, thanks to its innovative [unikernel architecture](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-postgres-early-access). This week, we're bringing major improvements to it!

### Local Prisma Postgres now works with any ORM & tool

We recently released [direct connections](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/direct-connections) for _remote_ Prisma Postgres so that you can now use it with your favorite ORM or database tool (yes, Drizzle too 😉). As of this release, this is also possible for your [_local_ Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/local-development) instances.

To try it, run the `prisma dev` command and use the direct connection string starting with `postgres://` in order to connect from any tool.

## More visual DB workflows in VS Code

We recently released a [database management UI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/integrations/vscode-extension#database-management-ui) as part of the Prisma VS Code extension to enable visual database management workflows for [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres). 

### Manage local Prisma Postgres instances in VS Code

In the latest release, we added new functionality to it: You can now manage multiple _local_ Prisma Postgres instances via the same UI.

To try it, find the **Prisma logo** in VS Code's sidebar and start managing your local Prisma Postgres instances (no Docker required).

### "Push to Cloud": Easily deploy a local Prisma Postgres instance in VS Code

Local Prisma Postgres instances are perfect for development, but how do you go _from local to remote_ once you're ready to deploy?

![](/blog/orm-6-10-0-new-features-for-prisma-postgres-remote-mcp-and-more/imgs/59abb90b65ee033198e4754d302c19eea1f42062-708x480.gif)

The database management UI in VS Code now has a **Push to Cloud** button that makes it easy to deploy your local Prisma Postgres so that you can connect to it from your deployed applications. 

## Let your favorite AI tool manage Prisma Postgres via remote MCP

We just released a new [_remote_ MCP server](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/integrations/mcp-server#remote-mcp-server) that helps you manage Prisma Postgres instances! It enables your AI tools to help with these workflows:

- Managing databases and connection strings
- Creating and re-instantiating backups
- Querying databases via plain SQL
- Introspecting database schemas

You can start it using the `npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.prisma.io/mcp` command or integrate it in your favorite AI tool via the standard MCP config:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Prisma-Remote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.prisma.io/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
Here the MCP server is in action, creating a new database directly in the Warp AI terminal:

## Prisma ORM v6.10.0 with major improvements

We just released [Prisma ORM v6.10.0](https://www.github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.10.0) with some new highlights, read more below!

### No Rust engines for MS SQL Server & PlanetScale (Preview)

We are in the process of removing the Rust engines from Prisma ORM. If you want to try this, you can configure your `generator` like this:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js" // or `prisma-client`
  previewFeatures = ["queryCompiler", "driverAdapters"]
  output          = "../generated/prisma"
}
```
In this release, we are excited to move the `queryCompiler` (which enables using Prisma ORM without Rust engines) into Preview for MS SQL Server and PlanetScale databases.

Here's how to use it with MS SQL Server. First, make sure to re-generate Prisma Client for the changes on your `generator` to take effect:
```
npx prisma generate
```
Then, install the required driver adapter:
```
npm install @prisma/adapter-mssql
```
Once installed, you can instantiate `PrismaClient` as follows:

```ts
import { PrismaMssql } from '@prisma/adapter-mssql'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const config = {
  server: 'localhost',
  port: 1433,
  database: 'mydb',
  user: 'sa',
  password: 'mypassword',
  options: {
    encrypt: true, // Use this if you're on Windows Azure
    trustServerCertificate: true, // Use this if you're using self-signed certificates
  },
}

const adapter = new PrismaMssql(config)
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```
No more hassle with query engines, binary targets and an even smoother experience in serverless and edge environments!

### Support for shard keys on PlanetScale (Preview)

AI has increased both the demand for software _and_ new software being built. To deal with this high demand and the heavy workloads it creates, AI companies need to make sure their database is scalable and performant. As a lot of these AI tools already use Prisma ORM, we are adding better support for sharding when using PlanetScale, a popular database of choice for workloads like this.

We are introducing the new `@shardKey` and `@@shardKey` attributes in the Prisma schema to natively support [sharding](https://planetscale.com/docs/vitess/sharding) on PlanetScale. You can apply these to the fields in your models that should serve as shard keys in your database setup:

```prisma
// Single-column shard key
model User {
  id     String @default(uuid())
  region String @shardKey
}

// Multi-column shard key
model User {
  id         String @default(uuid())
  country    String
  customerId String
  @@shardKey([country, customerId])
}
```
Note that using this feature requires setting the [`shardKeys`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/planetscale#how-to-define-shard-keys-in-your-prisma-schema-preview) Preview features flag on your Prisma Client generator:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js" // or `prisma-client`
  output          = "../generated/prisma"
  previewFeatures = ["shardKeys"]
}
```
### Performance improvements for `prisma migrate dev`

We improved the `prisma migrate dev` command by optimizing the interactions with the shadow database. Our measurements show a 2x improvement in speed for some databases!

## Try out the new features & share your feedback

This week we released major improvement, both for Prisma Postgres and for Prisma ORM: Better local development, more elaborate UI workflows in VS Code, manual backups for Prisma Postgres, a remote MCP server to enable Prisma Postgres workflows in AI tools, a Rust-free preview of Prisma ORM for MySQL, PlanetScale and MSSQL, and more.

If you're using any of these features, we want to know what you think! Join the discussion on [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord), and ping us on [X](https://pris.ly/x).
