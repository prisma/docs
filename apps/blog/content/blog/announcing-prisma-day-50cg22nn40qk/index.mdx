## What to expect from Prisma Day

Prisma Day is dedicated to highlighting how application development, especially with data-intensive applications, is evolving. The day covers three main themes:

- Bring the **Prisma community** together in summery Berlin 😎
- Highlight **modern database workflows** and **app development best practices**
- Share how companies use **Prisma in production** to to leverage these workflows

### Ermerging trends in databases and application development

Many modern applications rely on several kinds of databases and other data sources to access the data they need. This brings new challenges to developers, such as managing and keeping application data in sync across multiple data sources.

Prisma Day focusses on recent trends that help engineers access and manage their data in better ways. Learn about multi-model databases, data platforms, data meshes and other technologies that help application developers to work with data more efficiently.

### Expert featured speakers

To accomplish all of this, we’ve invited some great speakers from the application development and database space and the Prisma community, including:

- [Spencer Kimball](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencerwkimball/), CEO at CockroachDB
- [Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg), CEO at ZEIT
- [Siegfried Puchbauer](https://twitter.com/ziegfri3d), Principal Engineer at Splunk
- [Evan Weaver](https://twitter.com/evan), CEO at FaunaDB
- [Vittorio Adamo](https://twitter.com/vztorious), Software Engineer at adidas
- [Johannes Schickling](https://twitter.com/schickling?lang=en), CEO at Prisma

In bringing together engineers and thought leaders from across industries and communities, Prisma Day will offer a deep introduction to modern approaches for managing application data. With speakers coming from companies in different stages of growth, the talks also highlight how the takeaways can apply across company sizes.

You can learn more about the full schedule on the Prisma Day [page](https://www.prisma.io/day)!

### A look into the future of Prisma

In addition to broader discussions about and application development, Prisma Day will have a preview of upcoming
Prisma features and products.

Some of the new features include Prisma 2, Yoga 2, and a number of currently unannounced improvements 🤫.

The sneak peak will also highlight some of the new Prisma 2 capabilities such as:

- using Prisma as a library
- an improved modeling language and powerful migration system
- a more powerful Prisma client API

> You can learn more about our upcoming features by taking a look at our [roadmap](https://pris.ly/roadmap).

Prisma Day is also great opportunity to share your personal feedback, give input on the Prisma features you’d like to see, and talk about what improvements would make the biggest difference for you.
