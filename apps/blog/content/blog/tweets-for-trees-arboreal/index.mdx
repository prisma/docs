  We're celebrating the launch of Prisma 2 to General Availability with a tree-planting initiative: join in for Prisma's April-long "Tweets for Trees" program.💚 🌿

As we enter into April of 2021 in some of the most eventful years of our lifetime, we wanted to do something a little different to celebrate the spring time 🌸. 

Since Prisma started, being eco-friendly has been something that we've [valued internally](https://prisma.io/about) and now we're excited to invite our community to join in to our effort!

With the recent release of Prisma [Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-migrate-ga-b5eno5g08d0b), all three aspects (Client, Migrate, and Studio) of Prisma are production ready. We've loved seeing what people have been writing and [posting on Twitter](https://pris.ly/x), and we thought we could use the opportunity to do something more. 

**With [Earth Day](https://www.earthday.org/) 🌍 coming up on the 22nd, Prisma will be planting a tree for every tweet about Prisma we see in April.** 

We're calling this initiative **#TweetsForTrees**. Every tweet tagging [@prisma](https://pris.ly/x) in the month of April will be eligible.

## How It Works

- In the month of April, the sharp sleuths at Prisma, will be on the lookout for tweets about Prisma. For any tweets containing "@prisma", we will reply with a 🌳 emoji, as long as it doesn't disturb the flow of the conversation. Otherwise, we'll just count it and get the tree quietly 🤩
- Weekly, we'll round up all of the tweets that we found and order that number of trees through [Tree-Nation](https://tree-nation.com/)
- We'll then let everyone know how many trees we've planted at the end of each week this month
- We'll just be counting original tweets that contain @prisma, rather than any conversation that includes @prisma in the replies

## How you can join in ✅

- Spread the word about Prisma, and tweet using the Prisma username. Some exciting recent announcements include:
    - The [Migrate GA](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-migrate-ga-b5eno5g08d0b)
    - The [Prisma Studio GA](https://www.prisma.io/blog)
    - Any of the new [Prisma releases](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) (in the month of April we expect to release Prisma 2.21, and 2.22)
    - You can also see all of the exciting new releases and updates that happened this quarter in our [summary blog post](https://www.prisma.io/blog/whats-new-in-prisma-q1-2021-spjyqp0e2rk1)
- Help us spot any tweets we've missed. You can ping us directly when people reference Prisma.

As this is a year, where we can only connect virtually 📺 and see each other through the screen, we're excited to make a greater impact beyond our desks! We're looking forward to seeing what a change we can make in the world together! 🌳 💚
