## Prisma ORM v6.13.0 is packed with new features

We’ve been hard at work behind the scenes developing several new features for Prisma ORM, check out all the updates below!

### Configuring Prisma ORM via `prisma.config.ts` is now Generally Available

Ever wanted a TypeScript-native way to configure your Prisma ORM project? With [`prisma.config.ts`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference) now Generally Available, that’s now a reality!

This file provides a native way to specify configuration options for your project, including:

- Custom paths for various Prisma assets:
    - Prisma schema file
    - Migrations
    - SQL view definitions
    - TypedSQL queries
- A `seed` command to populate your database based on some executable script
- Externally managed tables (see below)
- Driver adapters used by the Prisma CLI

Here’s an example Prisma Config file that specified custom locations for various project assets in and a seed script inside a `db` directory:

```ts
import path from "node:path";
import { defineConfig } from "prisma/config";

export default defineConfig({
  schema: path.join("db", "schema.prisma"),
  migrations: {
    path: path.join("db", "migrations"),
    seed: "tsx db/seed.ts",
  },
});
```
Now, when you run Prisma CLI commands, these custom paths will be respected—for instance, migration files will be created in the specified directories. 

Check out [the documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference) to learn more about the Prisma Config file!

### Using multiple schemas is now Generally Available

Looking to better organize your database tables? Multi-schema support is now Generally Available in Prisma ORM!

Databases like PostgreSQL and SQL Server allow logical organization of tables through *schemas*. With Prisma ORM, you can assign tables to specific schemas using the `@@schema` attribute:

```tsx
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  schemas  = ["base", "shop"]
}

model User {
  id     Int     @id
  orders Order[]

  @@schema("base")
}

model Order {
  id      Int  @id
  user    User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId  Int

  @@schema("shop")
}
```
Learn more about multiple schemas [in our docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/multi-schema).

### More robust support for SQL views (Preview)

SQL views are *virtual* tables defined by a stored query. They don’t store data but reflect the result of a query each time they're accessed.

We’re continuing to make support for views in Prisma ORM more robust. This release introduces key guardrails:

- `@id`, `@index`, and `@unique` are no longer permitted on `view` blocks.
- `findUnique` queries and cursor-based pagination are disabled for views.
- Writes and implicit ordering are disallowed in Prisma Client for views.
- Relationships involving views are disallowed in Prisma Schema.

These updates align Prisma ORM’s API with what SQL views actually support, making it safer and clearer to use them. Learn more about views [in our docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/views).

### Externally managed tables: query without migrations

Sometimes, you might not want Prisma ORM to manage specific tables—such as ones handled by another team or service.

With this release, externally managed tables can now be:

- Queried via Prisma Client
- Ignored by Prisma Migrate

Specify them in your `prisma.config.ts` like this:

```ts
// prisma.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  tables: {
    external: [
      "users",
    ]
  },
  ...
})
```
A common use case is the [`users` table from Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/managing-user-data), which you may want to query but never modify via migrations. Learn more about externally managed tables [in our docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/externally-managed-tables).

## `pgvector` extension support for Prisma Postgres in Early Access

We’ve added a much-requested feature to Prisma Postgres: [Early Access](https://www.prisma.io/docs/platform/maturity-levels#early-access) support for the [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) PostgreSQL extension along with several other popular Postgres extensions!

It allows vector storage directly in your Postgres instance, making Prisma Postgres perfect for building AI-powered applications without needing a separate vector database.

Native `pgvector` support in Prisma ORM is coming soon. In the meantime, use it via [custom migrations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/customizing-migrations) and [TypedSQL](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-typedsql-make-your-raw-sql-queries-type-safe-with-prisma-orm).

Create a migration like this:

```shell
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-pgvector --create-only
```
Then customize the migration file:

```sql
-- prisma/migrations/<timestamp>-add-pgvector/migration.sql

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

CREATE TABLE "Document" (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  embedding VECTOR(1536)
);
```
Apply the the migration in your database:

```tsx
npx prisma migrate dev
```
Use it via TypedSQL:

```sql
-- prisma/sql/semanticSearch.sql

SELECT id, title, embedding
FROM "Document"
ORDER BY "embedding" <=> $1
LIMIT 5;
```
Then, run `prisma generate --sql` and use the query in your code:

```tsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate';
import { semanticSearch } from '@prisma/client/sql';

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

const queryEmbedding = [0.12, -0.5, 0.33, ...]; // match your embedding model’s dimensions

const result = await prisma.$queryRawTyped(semanticSearch(queryEmbedding));
```
In addition to `pgvector`, Prisma Postgres now includes Early Access support for `pg_search`, `pg_stat_statements`, `citext`, `pg_trgm`, `fuzzystrmatch`, and `unaccent`. If you don’t see the extension you need, you can [request it here](https://pris.ly/i-want-extensions).

See [the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/postgres-extensions) for details on Postgres extensions in Prisma Postgres.

## CI/CD workflows for Prisma Postgres via a new Management API

Need to provision Prisma Postgres instances in CI/CD, attach databases to preview branches, or offer managed databases to users? Our [new Management API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/api-reference/management-api) has you covered!

It’s a REST API that lets you:

- Create/delete Prisma Postgres instances
- Manage connection strings
- Automate workflows in [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io/)

Here’s an example of creating a project with the `POST /project` endpoint in TypeScript:

```tsx
// Set HTTP headers (auth via a dedicated service token)
const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${SERVICE_TOKEN}`, // get your token in Prisma Console
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
};

// Create a new project
const projectName = `demo-project-${Date.now()}`;
const region = 'us-east-1';

const createProjectRes = await axios.post(
  `https://api.prisma.io/v1/projects`,
  { name: projectName, region },
  { headers }
);

const project = createProjectRes.data;
const projectId = project.id || (project.data && project.data.id);

console.log('Created project and databases: \\n', project);
```
Learn more in our guides:

- [Basic usage](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/management-api-basic)
- [CI/CD with GitHub Actions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/github-actions)

### CI/CD GitHub Actions for Prisma Postgres available on GitHub Marketplace

Based on the Management API, we’ve also published two templates for GitHub Actions that you can use in your own CI/CD setups:

- [**Create Prisma Postgres Database Action**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-prisma-postgres-database)
- [**Delete Prisma Postgres Database Action**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/delete-prisma-postgres-database)

These Actions serve as the foundational building blocks for integrating Prisma Postgres into CI/CD pipelines. 

![GitHub Actions sample](/blog/orm-6-13-0-ci-cd-workflows-and-pgvector-for-prisma-postgres/imgs/d08557fd614a1bcf64b7c3f55bd81d799443f426-2040x1618.png)

They enable workflows like provisioning databases on every pull request, running integration tests against real instances, and managing database lifecycles end-to-end. We’ve included several examples in the README to help users get started quickly. The setup is straightforward, and these Actions are designed to plug into user's workflows with minimal effort.

### Instant Postgres with `npx create-db` — no auth required

We launched a new CLI command that allows you to spin up a new database within seconds:

```shell
npx create-db # no auth required
```
The command doesn’t require authentication, so you can play around with your database without any initial hurdles! 

![Running npx create-db](/blog/orm-6-13-0-ci-cd-workflows-and-pgvector-for-prisma-postgres/imgs/bd1a52263c6e36773fe0c4b003a81298d7f175f4-800x450.gif)

Your instance will be automatically deleted after 24 hours *but* you can claim it and put it into your [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) account if you want to keep using it after that period. Learn more about the new command [in our docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/introduction/npx-create-db).

## New navigation UI for Prisma Console

The [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io/) got a visual refresh! Navigation has been redesigned to make workflows like:

- Creating new projects
- Switching between projects and databases
- Accessing project settings

…easier and more intuitive than ever.

![New Dashboard](/blog/orm-6-13-0-ci-cd-workflows-and-pgvector-for-prisma-postgres/imgs/a3438ae7d08cb86d8ac9db19dc2ad2ac4edf2c4c-3070x1866.png)

## Try out the new features & let us know what you think

We’ve released a bunch of new features this week! Prisma Config and multi-schema support are now GA, and SQL view support is almost there. On the Prisma Postgres side, we're excited about `pgvector` support and the new Management API—great for CI/CD and preview databases.
