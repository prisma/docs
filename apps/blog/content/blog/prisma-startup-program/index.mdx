excerpt: |
  At Prisma, we know that building a startup is an intense journey—one that requires focus, speed, and the right tools to scale. That’s why we’re excited to introduce the Prisma Startups Program, designed to help early-stage companies move fast, stay lean, and build scalable applications with ease.

## What’s in the Program?

We’ve built this program to provide startups with the best resources to accelerate development and scale with confidence, while focusing on your own mission — not your infrastructure. Here’s what you get:

- **$10,000 in credits** – Have your database bill covered for up to a year and $10k, while building with Prisma Postgres, our modern serverless database.
- **1:1 Guidance on Design & Architecture** – Work directly with our experts to optimize your infrastructure and ensure best practices in database and application design.
- **Direct Support in a Slack Channel** – Gain access to a dedicated Slack channel where you can get real-time help from our team, and even connect with other startup founders.
- **Co-Marketing & Growth Opportunities** – Get featured in our case studies, newsletters, and startup showcases to help amplify your reach.

## Who’s Eligible?

The Prisma Startups Program is open to early-stage companies that are building scalable applications up to Series A stage. If you’re an ambitious founder looking to accelerate your development workflow, this program is for you. (see link at the bottom for full detail)

## Meet Prisma Postgres: The Next Generation of Serverless Databases

Prisma Postgres is a truly next-generation serverless database. Unlike traditional serverless databases, Prisma Postgres eliminates cold starts while offering full integration with the Prisma ORM, ensuring seamless development and ultra-fast performance. As part of the **Prisma Startups Program**, participants receive credits to help them build with the power of Prisma Postgres.

Applying is simple—just visit our [Startups Program page](https://prisma.io/startups), fill out a short application, and our team will review your submission. We’re committed to supporting the next generation of innovative companies, and we’d love to have you onboard.
