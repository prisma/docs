## Releases & new features

Our engineers have been hard at work issuing new [releases](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/) with many improvements and new features every two weeks. Here is an overview of the most exciting features that we have launched in the last three months.

You can stay up-to-date about all upcoming features on our [roadmap](https://pris.ly/roadmap).

### Prisma Migrate is generally available 🚀

The biggest news in this quarter certainly was the launch of Prisma Migrate for [General Availability](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#generally-available-ga). This means, you can now use Prisma Migrate without the `--preview-feature` option:

**Before v2.19.0**
```
npx prisma migrate <COMMAND> --preview-feature

# for example:
npx prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
```
**Now**
```
npx prisma migrate <COMMAND>

# for example:
npx prisma migrate dev
```
You can learn more about this in the [release notes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.19.0), the [announcement article](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-migrate-ga-b5eno5g08d0b) and the [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac-HWBTtLAU&t=51s&ab_channel=Prisma) by [Daniel](https://twitter.com/daniel2color) and [Tom](https://twitter.com/_tomhoule).

### Use native database types in the Prisma schema

In this quarter, we made it possible to use a much broader range of native database types in the Prisma schema.

For example, you can now define `VARCHAR` types of a specific length or use other database-specific types like (in this case for PostgreSQL) `MONEY`, variations of date/time types like `TIME`, `TIMETZ` or `TIMESTAMPTZ` and a lot more.

Here's an example:



```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement()) @db.Integer
  email    String    @unique @db.VarChar(191)
  birthday DateTime? @db.Timestamptz
  wealth   Decimal   @db.Money
}
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE "User" (
    "id" SERIAL NOT NULL,
    "email" VARCHAR(191) NOT NULL,
    "birthday" TIMESTAMPTZ,
    "wealth" MONEY NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "User.email_unique" ON "User"("email");
```


For a full overview of available types, check out the type mapping sections in the docs:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql#type-mapping-between-postgresql-to-prisma-schema)
- [MySQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mysql#type-mapping-between-mysql-to-prisma-schema)
- [SQLite](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/sqlite#data-model-mapping)
- [SQL Server](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/sql-server#type-mapping-between-microsoft-sql-server-to-prisma-schema) (Preview)

### Seed your database with the Prisma CLI (Preview)

The new [`prisma db seed`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/command-reference#db-seed-preview) command enables you to automatically [invoke a seed script](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/migrate/seed-database#set-up-seeding-in-typescript) to feed your database with some initial data.

The command expects a file called `seed` with the respective file extension inside your main prisma directory:

- JavaScript: `prisma/seed.js`
- TypeScript: `prisma/seed.ts`
- Shell: `prisma/seed.sh`

Alternatively you can pass the `--schema` option to the CLI command in order to point to the location of the seed script or define a default `schema` location in your `package.json` which will be picked up every time you run the command.

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Expand to view a sample seed script">
```ts
// prisma/seed.ts

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// A `main` function so that we can use async/await
async function main() {
  const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: 'sarah@prisma.io',
    },
  })
  console.log(`New user created`, newUser.id)
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    console.error(e)
    process.exit(1)
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### New features for the Prisma Client API

We regularly add new features to the Prisma Client API to enable more powerful database queries that were previously only possible via plain SQL and the [`$queryRaw`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/raw-database-access#queryraw) escape hatch .

#### Order by relations (Preview)

Since [2.16.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.16.0), you can order the results of `findMany` queries by properties of [related](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations) models. For example, you can order a list of posts alphabetically by the names of their authors:



```ts
cons posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  orderBy: [
    {
      author: {
        name: 'asc',
      },
    },
  ],
})
```
```prisma
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  authorId Int
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  nam   String
  posts Post[]
}
```


Additionaly, the [2.19.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.19.0) release makes it possible to order by the aggregates (e.g. count) of relations as well. Here's is an example that orders a list of users by the number of the posts they created:



```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  orderBy: {
    posts: {
      count: 'asc',
    },
  },
})
```
```prisma
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  authorId Int
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  nam   String
  posts Post[]
}
```


#### Count on relations (Preview)

This [highly requested feature](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5079) is now Preview since [2.20.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.20.0). You can now count the number of related records by passing `_count` to the `select` or `include` options and then specifying which relation counts should be included in the resulting objects via another `select`.

For example, counting the number of posts that an user has written:



```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: {
    _count: {
      select: { posts: true },
    },
  },
})
```
```js
{
  id: 1,
  email: 'alice@prisma.io',
  name: 'Alice',
  _count: { posts: 2 }
}
```


#### Efficient bulk creates with `createMany`

The new `createMany` operation (introduced in [2.16.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.16.0)) enables you to insert data a whole lot faster:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.createMany({
  data: [
    { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    { email: 'nilu@prisma.io' },
    { email: 'mahmoud@prisma.io' },
    { email: 'etel@prisma.io' },
  ],
})

console.log(`Created ${result.count} users!`)
```
#### Directly set foreign keys

Since [2.15.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.16.0), it is possible to dirctly set foreign keys instead of wiring up relations via the `connect` API:

```ts
// An example of the new API that directly sets the foreign key
const user = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: 'Hello World',
    userId: 42,
  },
})

// If you prefer, you can still use the previous API via `connect`
const user = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: 'Hello World',
    user: {
      connect: { id: 42 }, // sets userId of Profile record
    },
  },
})
```
#### Group by

Since [2.14.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.14.0), Prisma Client supports _group by_ queries:



```ts
const locations = await client.agent.groupBy({
  by: ['location'],
  min: {
    rate: true,
  },
})
```
```js
[
  { location: "Los Angeles", min: { rate: 10.00 } },
  { location: "London", min: { rate: 20.00 } },
  { location: "Tokyo", min: { rate: 30.00 } }
]
```
```prisma
model Agent {
   id         String @id
   name       String
   location   String
   rate       Float
 }
```


Additionally, you can further filter the result by using the `having` option:



```ts
const locations = await client.agent.groupBy({
  by: ['location', 'rate'],
  min: {
    rate: true,
  },
  having: {
    rate: {
      gte: 20,
    },
  },
})
```
```js
[
  { location: "London", rate: 20.00, min: { rate: 20.00 } },
  { location: "Tokyo", rate: 30.00, min: { rate: 30.00 } }
]
```
```prisma
model Agent {
   id         String @id
   name       String
   location   String
   rate       Float
 }
```


You can learn more about these queries in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/aggregation-grouping-summarizing).

#### Reducing overhead between Node.js and Rust with N-API (Preview)

[N-API](https://napi.rs/) is a new technique for binding Prisma's Rust-based [query engine](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-engines/query-engine) directly to Prisma Client that was introduced in [2.20.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.20.0). This reduces the communication overhead between the Node.js and Rust layers when resolving Prisma Client's database queries.

Enabling the N-API will not affect your workflows in any way, the experience of using Prisma will remain exactly the same.

The N-API has different runtime characteristics than the current communication layer between Node.js and Rust. There may be some rough edges during the Preview period.

#### New features for Prisma Client Go

In case you're not aware, [Prisma Client also is available for Golang](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-go) in an [Early Access](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/releases#early-access) version.

You can learn more about Prisma Client Go in the [documentation](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-go/tree/master/docs). Also note that we are actively looking for feedback for Prisma Client Go!

You can help us accelerate the release process by [creating issues](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-go/issues) and sharing your feedback in the [`#prisma-client-go`](https://app.slack.com/client/T0MQBS8JG/C015HGAQZ0D) channel on the [Prisma Slack](https://slack.prisma.io).

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Expand to view the new Prisma Client Go features from this quarter">
This quarter, Prisma Client Go saw some exciting updates as well:

_Upserts_

```go
post, _ := client.Post.UpsertOne(
    // query
    Post.ID.Equals("upsert"),
).Create(
    // set these fields if document doesn't exist already
    Post.Title.Set("title"),
    Post.Views.Set(0),
    Post.ID.Set("upsert"),
).Update(
    // update these fields if document already exists
    Post.Title.Set("new-title"),
    Post.Views.Increment(1),
).Exec(ctx)
```
_Dynamic filters_

```go
func CreateUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var params []db.UserSetParam
    email := r.PostFormValue("email")
    kind := r.PostFormValue("kind")
    if kind == "customer" {
        // Set the referrer for users of type customer only
        params = append(params, db.User.Referer.Set(r.Header.Get("Referer"))
    }
    user, err := client.User.CreateOne(
        db.User.Kind.Set(kind),
        db.User.Email.Set(email),
        params...,
    ).Exec(r.Context())
    // ... Handle the response
}
```
_Transactions_

```go
createUserA := client.User.CreateOne(
	db.User.ID.Set("c"),
	db.User.Email.Set("a"),
)
createUserB := client.User.CreateOne(
	db.User.ID.Set("d"),
	db.User.Email.Set("b"),
)
err := client.Prisma.Transaction(createUserA, createUserB).Exec(ctx)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
```
_New types: `BigInt`, `Decimal` and `Bytes`_

```go
var views db.BigInt = 1
bytes := []byte("abc")
dec := decimal.NewFromFloat(1.23456789)
created, err := client.User.CreateOne(
  db.User.Picture.Set(bytes),
  db.User.Balance.Set(dec),
  db.User.Views.Set(views),
).Exec(ctx)
```

## Tools & ecosystem

### Blitz

We are excited for the [Blitz](https://blitzjs.com/) community to see them launch an official beta version of their framework, including a new website and documentation:

<TweetEmbedComp tweets={["1362048912476016642"]} />

Blitz is a batteries-included framework that's inspired by Ruby on Rails, is built on Next.js, and features a "Zero-API" data layer abstraction that eliminates the need for REST/GraphQL. It uses Prisma as its default ORM layer.

### KeystoneJS

While it's already possible to use KeystoneJS with Prisma as the ORM, the [upcoming version of KeystoneJS](https://next.keystonejs.com/) will use Prisma as its default database adapter.

KeystoneJS founder [Jed Watson](https://twitter.com/JedWatson) recently was a guest on the [What's new in Prisma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwhb33vm5uk&t=1902s&ab_channel=Prisma) livestream where he gave a demo of KeystoneJS with Prisma.

<TweetEmbedComp tweets={["1362717932078383109"]} />

### Wasp

Backed by YCombinator, the twin brothers [Martin](https://twitter.com/MartinSosic) and [Matija](https://twitter.com/matijasosic) Šošić are building [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev/), a DSL for building fullstack web applications. They recently [launched Wasp on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26091956).

To learn more about Wasp, be sure to check out Matija's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3PNKJKsSuU&ab_channel=Prisma) at our recent Prisma Meetup:

<Youtube videoId="p3PNKJKsSuU" />

### Amplication

[Amplication](https://github.com/amplication/amplication) is another exciting tool that promises to make web developers more productive, is built on Prisma and recently [launched on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25749492).

It allows to instantly generate fully-fledged REST and GraphQL APIs. The projects are configured via a web UI but can be fully customized as the underlying NestJS app can be downloaded and edited by the developer.

### `prisma-appsync` generator

[Sylvain Simao](https://linktr.ee/maoosi) recentely released a first version of [`prisma-appsync`](https://github.com/maoosi/prisma-appsync), a custom `generator` for the Prisma schema that enables developer to generate a full-blown GraphQL CRUD API via AWS AppSync and deployable with single command of the AWS CDK.

To learn more, check out the [documentation](https://prisma-appsync.vercel.app/) and watch our recent [What's new in Prisma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac-HWBTtLAU&t=494s&ab_channel=Prisma) episode.

## What's next?

The best places to stay up-to-date about what we are currently working on are [GitHub issues](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues) and our public [roadmap](https://pris.ly/roadmap).

We are currently working on a [connector for MongoDB](https://www.notion.so/prismaio/Support-MongoDB-9f115ebf4a754069a7d7eaae94dc4651) and are hoping to have an Early Access version of it ready in the next three months. 

Another major area we are focusing on is the development of a _cloud product_ that will make it easier for teams and larger organizations to collaborate on Prisma projects. To get an initial impression of what we are planning, you can [watch the talks from the Prisma Enterprise Event](https://prisma-data.typeform.com/to/YUln0miL). Stay tuned and keep an eye out for more articles on this blog in the next few weeks 👀
