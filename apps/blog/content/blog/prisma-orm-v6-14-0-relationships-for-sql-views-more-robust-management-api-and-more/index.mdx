  Yesterday, we released [Prisma ORM v6.14.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.14.0) with the ability to define relationships across SQL views, a more robust Management API for programmatically provisioning Prisma Postgres, various fixes and stability improvements.
---

## Relationships & `findUnique` queries for SQL views (Preview)

In the [last release](https://pris.ly/release/6.13.0), we improved the robustness of [SQL views](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/views) defined in the Prisma schema. Views are _virtual_ tables that don't allow for defining foreign keys in the underlying database. 

However, as an application developer, it can be convenient to also define relations across them. We've received this feedback from several people who had been using views in that way with Prisma ORM. So, in this release we're re-introducing the `@unique` attribute for views. This attribute enables:

- relationships to and from views
- `findUnique` queries, cursor-based pagination and implicit ordering for views

Here's how you can define them on the `view` blocks in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
view UserInfo {
  email String @unique
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```
## Various fixes & stability improvements in Prisma ORM

As we're getting closer to Prisma ORM v7, we're focusing a lot on increasing the stability of the new, ESM-compatible `prisma-client` generator as well the Rust-free Prisma ORM (aka `queryCompiler`). In the last sprint, we fixed several issues related to both of these. This combination will become the default in v7 and we're working hard on bringing these features into General Availability. You can try them out with your favorite stack with our [ready-to-run examples](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client).

Additionally, we increased the robustness of Prisma ORM and cleaned up some legacy code:

- Fixed several regressions, e.g. related to Prisma Config
- Removed middleware from Prisma Client (i.e. the `prisma.$use` method), which was deprecated since v4.16.0. Use [Prisma Client extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions) instead.
- Deprecated `metrics` Preview feature (which will be removed in Prisma v7)

## Increased robustness of Prisma Postgres Management API

We recently released an [API for programmatically managing Prisma Postgres instances](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/introduction/management-api) that's perfect for CI/CD workflows. In this release, we made it more robust and are bringing it closer to its General Availability release.

While it's not yet fully production-ready, we encourage to try it out! If you want to provision databases in your CI/CD pipeline, check out these example GitHub Actions we've built as a reference for you:

- [Create Prisma Postgres Database Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-prisma-postgres-database)
- [Delete Prisma Postgres Database Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/delete-prisma-postgres-database)

We also published several guides that show you how to get started with it:

- [Getting started with the Prisma Management API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/management-api-basic)
- [Provisioning preview databases with GitHub Actions and Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/github-actions)
- [Partner database provisioning & user claim flow](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/management-api)

## Revoke OAuth tokens  in Prisma Console

If you use OAuth to authorize third-party applications to act on your behalf in the Prisma Console, you can now revoke any app's access at any time. The Prisma Console shows a list of your authorized (connected) apps, and you can easily remove one to immediately block further access.

## ICYMI: Last release was packed with new features

In case you missed it: Our [last release](https://pris.ly/release/6.14.0) was *huge* and packed with new features! Here's the TLDR of what we put out last time:

- **Prisma ORM**
  - **Prisma Config file (`prisma.config.ts`) is Generally Available** – Native way to configure schema paths, migrations, seeds, and more; no need for `earlyAccess` flag anymore.
  - **Multi-schema support is Generally Available** – Allows assigning models to different database schemas in Postgres and SQL Server using `@@schema`.
  - **Improved SQL views support (still in Preview)** – Adds guardrails for views by disabling unsupported features.
  - **Externally managed tables** – Lets you exclude specific tables from Prisma Migrate while still querying them via Prisma Client.
- **Prisma Postgres**
  - **Extension support for Prisma Postgres** – Prisma Postgres now supports `pgvector`, `pg_search`, `pg_stat_statements`, `citext`, `pg_trgm`, `fuzzystrmatch`, and `unaccent`. If you don't see the extension you need, you can [request it here](https://pris.ly/i-want-extensions). Extensions only work on *new* instances, if you want to use any of them on your existing instance, [reach out to us](mailto:support@prisma.io).
  - **Management API for Prisma Postgres** – REST API to provision, delete, and manage Prisma Postgres instances programmatically, perfect for CI/CD and scripting workflows.
  - **GitHub Actions for Prisma Postgres** – Actions for creating and deleting databases in CI/CD workflows, available on GitHub Marketplace.
  - **New CLI: `npx create-db`** – Instantly spin up a new Postgres database—no authentication required.

## Try it out & share your feedback

In this release we brought Prisma ORM closer to its next major version release by making it more robust and fixing various issues. We also worked on the stability of the Management API for programmatically managing Prisma Postgres instances and will be moving it into General Availability soon!

If you've tried any of the new features we've released, we'd love your feedback! Join the conversation on [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord) or ping us on [X](https://pris.ly/x).
