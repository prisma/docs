### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What are the benefits of purchasing through AWS Marketplace?

**A:** No, you will have access to the same features and functionality as if you had purchased directly from Prisma.

#### How does pricing compare between AWS Marketplace and direct purchase?
**A:** The pricing for our products on AWS Marketplace is consistent with our direct pricing. However, because you are paying annually, there’s a 10% discount built into the annual pricing and for ongoing usage, if you are on the Pro plan, you get the Business plan usage pricing.

#### Can I purchase Prisma products through AWS Marketplace if I'm not in the United States?
**A:** AWS Marketplace is available in many countries. Please check AWS Marketplace availability in your region or contact our sales team for more information.

#### How do I manage my Prisma subscription after purchasing through AWS Marketplace?

#### Which Prisma Data Platform plans are available on AWS Marketplace?
**A:** You can purchase the Pro and Business plans on AWS Marketplace as public offers. If you are interested in Private offers, please follow the outlined process within AWS Marketplace. Note that even though the Pro and Business plans are annual on AWS Marketplace, usage is still billed on a monthly basis.

#### Do you offer a free trial through AWS Marketplace?
**A:** There is no free trial when purchasing through AWS Marketplace, but you can still do a free trial by signing up directly on Prisma Data Platform and then elect to pay via AWS Marketplace once your testing is over.

#### Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan once I have subscribed?
**A:** Since you will make an annual purchase, downgrading is not possible automatically. However, we are more than happy to help through the process. Just ping us at [support@prisma.io](mailto:support@prisma.io).

#### Do I need to host anything on AWS to make the purchase through AWS Marketplace?
**A:** No, only billing will route through AWS Marketplace. You will still manage your account on the Prisma Data Platform and all resources are deployed and managed automatically by the Prisma Data Platform. No additional infrastructure is required to be set up by you.
