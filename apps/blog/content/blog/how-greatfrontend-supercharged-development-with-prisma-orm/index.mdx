## The Birth of GreatFrontEnd

GreatFrontEnd is a cutting-edge development platform built to help front-end engineers upskill and advance their careers. They have two main development products:
 
  1. A [technical interview preparation platform](https://www.greatfrontend.com/) where front end engineers can practice coding interview questions.
  2. A [real-world projects platform](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects) where engineers can learn front end from zero by building real-world apps hands-on.
 
As their platform grew to support over 700,000 active users, their reliance on raw SQL queries started to hinder progress. They needed a smarter, more scalable solution to manage database interactions without compromising on type integrity.

## Overcoming Database Challenges

The team at GreatFrontEnd, boasting experience from companies like Meta, understood the power of type-safe APIs. But their existing raw SQL approach posed three major obstacles:

- **Type Safety Risks** – Writing raw SQL left room for runtime errors, increasing the chances of bugs creeping into production.
- **Schema Management Complexity** – Manually tracking and migrating schema changes across environments was tedious and error-prone.
- **Future-Proofing & Portability** – They needed a solution that wouldn't lock them into a single database provider, allowing flexibility for future scaling.

After evaluating various ORM solutions, they turned to Prisma ORM as the clear answer to these challenges.

## Why Prisma ORM?

GreatFrontEnd explored alternatives like Sequelize, but Prisma's modern approach to schema management and type-safe query generation stood out. Since they primarily use PostgreSQL, Prisma's ability to facilitate seamless transitions to MySQL or MongoDB in the future provided an added layer of adaptability.

### Transforming the Development Workflow

The shift to Prisma ORM brought an immediate transformation to GreatFrontEnd's development process:

Effortless Schema Evolution – Prisma’s built-in migration system made modifying schemas straightforward while maintaining backward compatibility.

Type-Safe Queries, Fewer Bugs – The auto-generated types reduced the risk of database query errors, significantly improving code reliability.

Seamless Sync Across Environments – From staging to production, database migrations became a smooth, predictable process.

## The Road Ahead

Having followed Prisma’s journey since its early Graphcool days, GreatFrontEnd sees it as the most robust ORM in the JavaScript ecosystem. Its continuous innovation and strong community support give them confidence in its ability to meet their evolving needs as they scale.

GreatFrontEnd’s experience highlights how the right database toolkit can elevate development efficiency and code quality. With Prisma’s comprehensive feature set, they’ve built a strong foundation for scalable, type-safe, and future-proof database operations—setting the stage for even greater innovation ahead.
