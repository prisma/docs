### With Checked Steps

Use the `checked` prop to mark completed steps with a checkmark icon. This is useful for showing progress in multi-step workflows.

```tsx
import { Steps, Step } from "@prisma-docs/eclipse";

export function CompletedSteps() {
  return (
    <Steps>
      <Step checked active>
        #### Create account
        Account created successfully.
      </Step>
      <Step active>
        #### Verify email
        Email verified.
      </Step>
      <Step checked active>
        #### Complete profile
        Currently filling out profile information.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        #### Start using the app
        Ready to begin after profile completion.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  );
}
```

<div className="not-prose my-6">
  <p className="text-sm font-semibold mb-4">Live Example:</p>
</div>

<Steps>
  <Step checked active>
    #### Create account
    Account created successfully.
  </Step>
  <Step active>
    #### Verify email
    Email verified.
  </Step>
  <Step checked active>
    #### Complete profile
    Currently filling out profile information.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### Start using the app
    Ready to begin after profile completion.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### With Active Steps

Use the `active` prop to visually highlight current or completed steps. Steps without the `active` prop are displayed with reduced opacity and neutral colors instead of the branded accent color, making them appear inactive.

```tsx
import { Steps, Step } from "@prisma-docs/eclipse";

export function ProgressIndicator() {
  return (
    <Steps>
      <Step active>
        #### Create account
        Your account has been created successfully.
      </Step>
      <Step active>
        #### Verify email
        Email verification in progress...
      </Step>
      <Step>
        #### Complete profile
        Add your personal information (upcoming).
      </Step>
      <Step>
        #### Start using the app
        Begin exploring features (upcoming).
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  );
}
```

<div className="not-prose my-6">
  <p className="text-sm font-semibold mb-4">Live Example:</p>
</div>

<Steps>
  <Step active>
    #### Create account
    
    Sign up for a new account with your email.
  </Step>
  <Step active>
    #### Verify email
    
    Check your inbox and click the verification link.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### Complete profile
    
    Add your personal information and preferences.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### Start using the app
    
    You're all set! Begin exploring features.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Vertical Variant

Use the `variant="vertical"` prop to display steps in a traditional vertical timeline layout, perfect for detailed instructions and tutorials.

```tsx
import { Steps, Step } from "@prisma-docs/eclipse";

export function VerticalSteps() {
  return (
    <Steps variant="vertical">
      <Step variant="vertical">
        #### Install dependencies
      </Step>
      <Step variant="vertical">
        #### Configure environment
      </Step>
      <Step variant="vertical">
        #### Start the server
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  );
}
```

<div className="not-prose my-6">
  <p className="text-sm font-semibold mb-4">Live Example:</p>
</div>

<Steps variant="vertical">
  <Step variant="vertical">
    #### Install dependencies
  </Step>
  <Step variant="vertical">
    #### Configure environment
  </Step>
  <Step variant="vertical" active>
    #### Start the server
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Steps Props

- `children` - Step components (ReactNode, required)
- `variant` - Layout variant: `"horizontal"` or `"vertical"` (default: `"horizontal"`)

### Step Props

- `children` - Step content, usually a heading and description (ReactNode, required)
- `active` - Whether the step is active/current/completed (boolean, default: false)
- `checked` - Whether the step is completed, displays a checkmark (boolean, default: false)
- `variant` - Layout variant: `"horizontal"` or `"vertical"` (should match parent Steps variant)

### Prop Details

The `variant` prop controls the layout direction:
- **`"horizontal"`** (default) - Horizontal progress indicator layout with separators between steps
- **`"vertical"`** - Traditional vertical timeline layout with connector lines

The `checked` prop replaces the step number with a checkmark (✓) icon to indicate completion. This is useful for:
- **Progress tracking** - Show which steps have been completed
- **Onboarding flows** - Guide users through setup with visual feedback
- **Form wizards** - Indicate completed sections

The `active` prop visually highlights the step indicator and content to show that it's the current step, a completed step, or an important step. Steps without this prop appear dimmed to indicate they are future, optional, or not yet completed. This is useful for:
- **Progress indicators** - Show which steps are active/completed vs. upcoming
- **Conditional workflows** - Highlight required steps while dimming optional ones
- **Multi-stage processes** - Indicate current and completed stages in a process

### Features

- ✅ Visual timeline with connector lines
- ✅ Numbered step indicators
- ✅ Checkmark indicators for completed steps
- ✅ Support for rich content (headings, code blocks, images)
- ✅ Automatic step numbering
- ✅ Active state for current or completed steps
- ✅ Vertical and horizontal layout variants
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessible and keyboard navigable
- ✅ Based on Fumadocs Steps

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive heading (h3 or h4) for each step title
- Keep step content concise and actionable
- Include code examples when relevant
- Order steps chronologically or logically
- Use 3-7 steps for optimal comprehension
- Add context or explanations after the heading
- Use `checked` prop to mark completed steps
- Use `active` prop to highlight current steps or completed actions
- Combine `checked` and `active` to create clear progress indicators
- Use horizontal variant (default) for progress indicators and short workflows
- Use vertical variant for detailed instructions and longer tutorials
- Ensure `variant` prop matches between `Steps` and `Step` components
- End with a clear completion or next steps

### Common Use Cases

The Steps component is perfect for:

- **Installation guides** - Step-by-step package installation and setup
- **Configuration workflows** - Sequential configuration steps
- **Troubleshooting guides** - Ordered debugging procedures
- **Onboarding flows** - User onboarding sequences with progress tracking
- **Migration guides** - Database or system migration steps
- **Tutorial sequences** - Learning paths and tutorials
- **Progress indicators** - Show completed and upcoming steps
