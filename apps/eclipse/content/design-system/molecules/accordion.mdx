import { Accordion, Accordions } from "@prisma-docs/eclipse";

### Usage

**Basic Accordion**

The Accordion component displays collapsible content sections with smooth animations.

```tsx
import { Accordions, Accordion } from "@prisma-docs/eclipse";

export function FAQSection() {
  return (
    <Accordions type="single">
      <Accordion title="What is Prisma?">
        Prisma is a next-generation ORM that makes working with databases easy for application developers.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="How do I get started?">
        You can get started by installing Prisma CLI and initializing a new project.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="What databases are supported?">
        Prisma supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB, and CockroachDB.
      </Accordion>
    </Accordions>
  );
}
```

<div className="not-prose my-6">
  <p className="text-sm font-semibold mb-4">Live Example:</p>
</div>

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="What is Prisma?">
    Prisma is a next-generation ORM that makes working with databases easy for application developers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I get started?">
    You can get started by installing Prisma CLI and initializing a new project.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What databases are supported?">
    Prisma supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB, and CockroachDB.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

**Multiple Open Items**

Allow multiple accordion items to be open simultaneously:

```tsx
import { Accordions, Accordion } from "@prisma-docs/eclipse";

export function MultipleAccordion() {
  return (
    <Accordions type="multiple">
      <Accordion title="Installation">
        Run npm install to get started.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Configuration">
        Configure your settings in the config file.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Usage">
        Import and use the components in your app.
      </Accordion>
    </Accordions>
  );
}
```

<div className="not-prose my-6">
  <p className="text-sm font-semibold mb-4">Live Example:</p>
</div>

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Installation">
    Run npm install to get started.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configuration">
    Configure your settings in the config file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Usage">
    Import and use the components in your app.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

**With Hash Linking**

Add IDs to accordion items for deep linking:

```tsx
import { Accordions, Accordion } from "@prisma-docs/eclipse";

export function HashLinkedAccordion() {
  return (
    <Accordions type="single">
      <Accordion 
        id="what-is-prisma" 
        title="What is Prisma?"
      >
        Prisma is a next-generation ORM that makes working with databases easy.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion 
        id="getting-started" 
        title="How do I get started?"
      >
        You can get started by installing Prisma CLI.
      </Accordion>
    </Accordions>
  );
}
```

When you provide an `id` prop, a copy link button appears that allows users to copy a direct link to that accordion item.

<div className="not-prose my-6">
  <p className="text-sm font-semibold mb-4">Live Example:</p>
</div>

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion 
    id="prisma-info" 
    title="What is Prisma?"
  >
    Prisma is a next-generation ORM that makes working with databases easy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    id="getting-started-guide" 
    title="How do I get started?"
  >
    You can get started by installing Prisma CLI.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

**With Custom Values**

Specify custom values for controlling which items are open:

```tsx
import { Accordions, Accordion } from "@prisma-docs/eclipse";

export function CustomValueAccordion() {
  return (
    <Accordions type="single" defaultValue="intro">
      <Accordion value="intro" title="Introduction">
        Welcome to our documentation.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion value="setup" title="Setup">
        Follow these steps to set up your project.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion value="usage" title="Usage">
        Learn how to use the features.
      </Accordion>
    </Accordions>
  );
}
```

### Accordions Props

- `type` - Control behavior: `"single"` (one open at a time) or `"multiple"` (multiple can be open) (optional, default: "single")

- `id` - Optional ID for the accordion (enables hash linking with copy button) (string, optional)
- `children` - The content shown when expanded (ReactNode, required)

### Best Practices

- Use clear, concise titles that describe the content
- Keep content readable and well-formatted
- Use `type="single"` for FAQ sections where only one answer should be visible
- Use `type="multiple"` for step-by-step guides where users may want to reference multiple sections
- Add `id` props when you want to enable deep linking to specific items
- Group related items together in the same Accordions container
- Limit the number of accordion items to 5-10 for better usability

- **FAQ sections** - Organize frequently asked questions
- **Step-by-step guides** - Break down complex processes
