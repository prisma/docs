        This privacy policy applies to the following Prisma websites: prisma.io, console.prisma.io,
        cloud.prisma.io, cloudprojects.prisma.io, and graph.cool. It is issued by Prisma Data, Inc.,
        which acts as the data controller for personal data described in this policy. Questions may
        be directed to <a href="mailto:dpo@prisma.io">dpo@prisma.io</a>.

          Prisma gathers data from website visitors and service users. Required contact details
          include name, company name, address, phone number, and email address. Billing information
          encompasses credit card details and employee count. Optional data covers company revenue
          and industry specifics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Website navigational information includes browser type, IP address, and user actions on
          the site. Embeddable Prisma Studio automatically collects application usage patterns,
          performance metrics, and integration metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
          Free Tier accounts provide metadata regarding usage volume and feature access for abuse
          monitoring and optimization. Users wanting Free Tier data deletion should contact{" "}
          <a href="mailto:support@prisma.io">support@prisma.io</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Free Tier telemetry captures API call frequency, schema size, project activities, and
          integration types — helping prevent abuse while maintaining service reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prisma does not intentionally collect sensitive personal data (such as health data,
          biometric data, or data revealing racial or ethnic origin).

        <p>
          Prisma utilizes customer data to deliver and support services. Contact forms enable
          outreach regarding service interest. Marketing efforts involve using provided information
          to discuss services and share company updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Credit card information is used exclusively for financial qualification and payment
          collection. Website navigational data helps operate and improve the site while enabling
          personalization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where the GDPR or UK GDPR applies, Prisma processes personal data on the following legal
          bases: performance of a contract (providing the services), legitimate interests (service
          improvement, security, and abuse prevention), consent (marketing communications and
          non-essential cookies), and compliance with legal obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Embeddable Studio telemetry enhances functionality and stability. Free Tier users receive
          transactional communications — such as plan limit, security, and service change notices —
          that are part of core service functionality and cannot be opted out of. Marketing
          communications, including feature announcements, always include an opt-out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prisma uses automated systems to monitor usage trends for abuse detection. Prisma does not
          make decisions producing legal or similarly significant effects about individuals based
          solely on automated processing.
