// Pricing hero: headline plus the plan cards, which it takes as children so the
// plan data stays in pricing-plans.tsx.
//
// Shane (2026-07-30): "Could we try a version where the hero and pricing table
// are visible above the fold? Right now there's a bit too much introductory text
// before you actually get to the pricing… I'd love the experience to be more
// like Vercel's pricing page, where you land and immediately see the plans."
//
// So the hero is a title band. What came out, and where it went — nothing is
// simply lost except the plan blurbs (see pricing-plans.tsx):
//  - The Pearly Plan testimonial and its prism ray. André approved removing it;
//    its avatar was a placeholder anyway and TestimonialsReveal already carries
//    testimonials further down the page.
//  - The subhead, which defined an operation. PricingHowItWorks opens with the
//    same definition ("Every query your app runs… counts as one operation"), so
//    the explanation still lands, just after the prices rather than before them.
//    That inversion is the point of the ask.
//  - The three checkmarks. "Free tier, no credit card required" is on the Free
//    card, "One bill, one platform" and the 5x claim are both in
//    PricingComparison.
//  - The two CTAs. Every plan card has its own, and CtaBurst closes the page.
//
// UNWRAPPED, unlike every other section on the site: no rounded panel, no
// border, full-bleed. André (2026-07-30) compared the page to Vercel's and asked
// for the wrapper off and more room throughout. The panel was containing the
// layout and making it read tighter than the reference. The spectral wash and
// grain stay — they carry the brand here now that the panel doesn't — but they
// run edge to edge and the section clips them.

          off at the section boundary and drew a visible seam straight across the
