// "How Prisma pricing works" — the every-plan-includes list stacked on the
// right. The calculator lives in its own section after this one (see
// pricing-calculator.tsx).
//
// Sits *below* the plan cards as of 2026-07-30 (client request). Reads as the
// explanation of the cards above it, and "Every plan includes" now lands as a
// footnote to them, which is where it belongs.
//
// Rewritten for the Compute GA launch (Shane, 2026-08-24): the V2 copy
// explained operations only, and this section is where the page's one-usage-
// model story has to land — Compute's four meters and Postgres's operations
// as two halves of the same idea. The operation definition keeps Gregory's
// locked wording (db-only); the workflow-stays-free paragraph and the bold
// spend-limit promise carry over from V2.

                Prisma bills you for real work, on both halves of your stack. Your app on Prisma
                Compute pays for the requests it serves, the memory and CPU it uses while running,
                and the data it sends out. Your database on Prisma Postgres counts every query as
                one operation, and operations are what you pay for.

                The ceremony around shipping stays free: deploys, preview branches, idle time, and
                the number of people on your team never add to the bill. An idle app scales to zero
                and costs nothing. A request does the same work whether it comes from a person, a
                script, or an AI agent, so that work is all you&apos;re charged for.

                Every paid plan also includes a hard spend limit, on by default, so usage-based
                pricing stays predictable and never becomes a surprise bill.
