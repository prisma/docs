// V2 plan cards. Corrections applied on top of V2:
//  - Gregory (2026-07-24): Business has an overage rate, $0.0010 per 1,000
//  - Shane (2026-07-29): "Most popular" moved from Pro to Starter, to anchor
//    on the lower price rather than making Prisma read as expensive; Free
//    states that it is free forever
//
// `compute` is each plan's Prisma Compute pricing — Compute GA (Shane,
// 2026-08-24). The numbers are LOCKED IN, hand-entered by Shane: requests
// include 1M requests, 360 GB-hours of memory, 4 vCPU-hours, and 10 GB of
// outbound bandwidth on Free with no usage billing. Paid tiers include
// 5M/20M/100M requests, then bill every meter by use. These cards are the
// page's source of truth — keep the Prisma Compute group in
// pricing-spec-table.tsx, pricing-data.ts, and the llms surfaces in sync
// with them.
//
// `blurb` is kept in the data but NOT rendered (2026-07-30). Shane asked to land
// on the plans with no preamble, and trimming the cards is what buys the last
// 40px: at 1440x800 the blurb pushed each card to 494px and the CTA fell below
// the fold. Left in place rather than deleted because it is approved V2 copy and
// this is the one piece of it with nowhere else to live — restoring it is a
// one-line change if the client would rather have the copy than the fold.
// Verify the fold if you do.
