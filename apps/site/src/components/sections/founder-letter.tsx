              <p>
                I spent the first three years of my career rebuilding the same things over and over.
                Authentication, billing, dashboards, email flows. Every new project started with
                weeks of boilerplate before I could write a single line of code that actually
                mattered.
              </p>

              <p>
                The worst part? I knew I wasn&apos;t alone. Every founder I talked to had the same
                story. Brilliant ideas collecting dust because the overhead of starting from zero
                was just too high. We were all solving the same solved problems instead of building
                the things only we could build.
              </p>

              <p>
                So we built the starting line we wished we had. Not a framework that locks you in,
                but a foundation you can make your own. Every piece is something we&apos;ve shipped
                in production, battle-tested across real products with real users. We stripped away
                the complexity and kept what actually matters.
              </p>

              <blockquote className="my-6 border-l-2 border-primary pl-4 italic text-foreground">
                &ldquo;The best products aren&apos;t built by the people with the most time.
                They&apos;re built by the people who spend their time on the right things.&rdquo
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                If you&apos;re tired of rebuilding what&apos;s already been built, we made this for
                you. Let&apos;s get to work.
