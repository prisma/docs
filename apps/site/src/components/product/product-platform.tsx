// The cross-sell. V4 shipped this as a fan of connections into three cards, and
// review found the picture read as lock-in — everything flowing out of Prisma,
// no way out drawn. The cards were then given a "swaps for" row, which said the
// right thing but nobody felt it.
//
// It is now an instrument the visitor operates: PlatformStack lets them rebuild
// the stack layer by layer and watch the golden path dim rather than break. The
// argument for using all of Prisma is made by what they lose on each swap, in
// the stack's own footer, rather than by a diagram insisting on it.
