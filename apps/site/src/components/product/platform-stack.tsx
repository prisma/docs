// The interactive half of the platform section.

// Two earlier attempts failed the same way: they listed each layer's
// alternatives as equal-weight rows, which read as a comparison table and gave
// no reason to touch anything. This one is built around a single mechanic —
// every layer has one slot, and you swap what's in it. Click an alternative and
// it physically flies up into the slot while the current occupant drops into
// its place, on a shared-layout tween. The motion IS the affordance: things
// move where you clicked, so the thing looks clickable.
//
// The message rides on the mechanic. Each slot holding its Prisma option glows
// in that product's brand hue and the pipeline between them flows; swap one out
// and that stretch of the pipeline goes grey and still. The path dims, it never
// breaks — which is exactly "best together, swappable when needed".
//
// Layers run cyan → yellow → red: the canonical product-accent order (icons.ts)
// and the order you'd build in — schema, data, deploy.
