// /orm copy, from the approved V4 of the Notion card "Product Page Batch One
// (3-5) - Copy", with the 2026-08-06 client review's changes marked inline.
//
// The review's headline note on this page: "The redesign leans heavily into
// AI/agents immediately. I'd first establish the core ORM value (schema →
// generated client → type-safe queries) since that's still what most users
// come for." V4's hero led with the agent, so the hero has been rewritten to
// lead with the schema and the typed client. The agent argument is not
// removed — it keeps the migrations narrative and the whole feedback-loop
// section below, it just no longer arrives before the ORM has been explained.
//
// Two notes on what V4 deliberately does NOT do, both still honoured:
//  - There is no signup CTA. The open-source ORM leads with GitHub and the
//    docs; "free to start" framing was ruled out for this page.
//  - The features and integrations carry no "Learn more" destinations, so none
//    are rendered rather than invented.
