// /compute copy, from the approved V4 of the Notion card "Product Page Batch
// One (3-5) - Copy", with the 2026-08-06 client review's changes marked inline.
//
// The review asked this page for three things, and the hero tour answers all
// three: show the deployment experience immediately (Connect → Deploy → Live),
// bring starter templates far higher, and name what actually runs here instead
// of leaving it abstract.
//
// Three things V4 deliberately does on this page:
//  - No testimonial section. /orm and /postgres carry one; Compute does not,
//    which is why this page composes its sections directly.
//  - No "in public beta" callout. V3 had one and V4 removed it — don't
//    reintroduce it from the homepage, which still labels Compute as beta.
//  - Five features (V4 shipped four; Object Store buckets, launched 2026-07-24,
//    were added after the review), rendered three-then-two with the last pair
//    centred — see product-features.tsx.
