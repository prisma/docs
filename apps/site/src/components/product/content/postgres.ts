// /postgres copy, from the approved V4 of the Notion card "Product Page Batch
// One (3-5) - Copy", with the deviations the 2026-08-06 client review asked for
// marked inline. Everything unmarked is still V4 verbatim.
//
// Three notes on this page specifically:
//  - Five features, which is the awkward count: they render three across with
//    the last pair centred beneath (see product-features.tsx).
//  - "no cold starts" stays where V4 put it — the tail of the compliance
//    feature. A standing guardrail says not to promote it to a headline claim,
//    so it is deliberately absent from the illustrations.
//  - The review asked the first screen to answer "why Prisma Postgres and not
//    any other Postgres?". The hero tour is that answer: branching, Studio and
//    Query Insights are the three things a bare managed Postgres doesn't give
//    you, so they lead rather than sitting in feature cards further down.
