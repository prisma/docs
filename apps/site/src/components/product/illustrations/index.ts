// Illustrations referenced by name from ProductPageContent, for the same reason
// icons are (see ../icons.ts): content objects stay serializable and CMS-ready.
// Extend as product pages need more abstractions.
//
// Two scales live here. Feature-card abstractions sit in a SurfaceCard and are
// read at ~260px tall; the hero-tour panels (see ../product-tour.tsx) sit in a
// HeroPanel and fill ~600x450, so they carry far more real detail. Both are in
// this one map because content addresses them the same way.
