// Built from the approved V2 pricing copy, in V2's order (CTA then FAQs).
// Compute GA launch (Shane, 2026-08-24): Compute pricing lives inside the
// existing structures — included allowances on the plan cards, rates and
// allowances as a group in the spec table — NOT as a separate section, hero
// subhead, or strip (all three were tried and removed on Shane's feedback:
// "we already have a table for these things").
// "Every plan includes" is the right-hand column of PricingHowItWorks; the
// calculator's three entry points double as its preset selector.
//
// Plan cards sit directly under the hero panel, ahead of the how-it-works
// copy, per the client (2026-07-30) — Shane asked for the table to be
// reachable without scrolling. The hero subhead still defines an operation
// before the cards quote operation counts, so the definition precedes the
// number even though the full explanation now follows the cards.
// Still to come: the full limits table Ankur asked for — blocked on the
// unanswered rows (Free-tier backups, compliance on Free/Starter, support).
