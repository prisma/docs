        - People who are unfamiliar with relational databases and wish to begin learning. It provides an easy pathway into learning how to write and optimise queries.
        - Applications where a large amount of the queries will be simple crud queries, it is very quick to write the queries in Prisma and the type safety means migrations to the data structure will not allow you to deploy broken queries.

        For more intensive queries, there is the flexibility to "pop the hood" and write raw sql and database functions to do some heavy lifting.`,

        While the company grows, it will become easier to onboard newer developers and reduce the amount of time taken for them to maximise their value to the company.
