# Contributing to Prisma Documentation

Thank you for wanting to contribute to our docs! If you come across some documentation on [prisma.io/docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs) that you feel is missing or incorrect, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## New contributor guide

In general, we would recommend you first open an issue before submitting a pull request. In some cases, Prisma contributors may be able to describe the issue or offer a solution. If you would like to try and solve the issue yourself, please feel free to read [our README](./README.md), get set up with the docs repo, and submit a pull request.

### I am not sure my changes are valid

If you are not sure your changes are valid, then please still open an issue and we will discuss it. Contributions from community members are welcome and will be considered for inclusion.

### Creating an issue

There are no hard and fast rules for creating an issues to the repository. We only ask that you outline your reasoning for creating the issue and try to provide as much detail as possible. Depending on the issue, this could mean explaining what machine you are working on (Is it a Mac? Are you on a Windows machine?), or including a code snippet that demonstrates the issue.

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

### Solving an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See "[Label reference](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference)" for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Creating a pull request (PR)

Similar to issues, we do not have hard and fast rules for Pull Requests. If you are opening a pull request we do ask that you:

- Describe the reason for the PR. A little context goes a long way in helping to quickly scan the PR
- Briefly describe what changes were made
- Link to any relevant issues

The Prisma team may ask for changes before a PR can be merged. As these changes are made, please mark the corresponding comments as "resolved". If you need help on a pull request or would like feedback, please feel free to mention the `@Dev-Connections` team.

As a final note, if you're still working on a PR, please utilize the "Draft Pull Request" feature to let us know that your work is not yet ready. 

Thank you again for contributing to our documentation!
