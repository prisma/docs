Prisma releases updates to Prisma Data Platform multiple times per week, as opposed to the Prisma ORM that we release on a set schedule every few weeks. This is why we consider the lifecycle and process for maturing features in Prisma Data Platform differently.

You can [check out the releases and maturity process for the Prisma ORM](/orm/more/releases) for further details.

You can find information about releases across _all_ Prisma tools and products in the [changelog](https://www.prisma.io/changelog).

### Early Access

If a feature on the Prisma Data Platform is labeled as **Early Access**:

- We have validated a problem and are considering a solution to it but are not certain whether that solution is complete or a perfect fit.
- We want to gather more feedback and adjust the solution as necessary, knowing that users are prepared for significant breaking changes
- We reserve ourselves the right to throttle or remove access to a feature in Early Access to preserve the stability of the platform, or enforcing its use to stay within the scope defined in our [Terms of Service](https://pris.ly/terms).

As always, your feedback in our [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=inline_text) is invaluable to shape the design of the features. This will help us ensure that they can solve your problems in the best way possible.

### Preview

If a feature on the Prisma Data Platform is labeled as **Preview**:

- We have refined the software based on the valuable feedback we obtained during the Early Access phase.
- We developed the feature further, bringing it closer to the final version, though it's not completely ready for production usage.
- We have lifted the invite gate, so users no longer need an invitation to access the feature. Users just need to sign up to gain access.
- We have increased the stability of the software compared to the Early Access phase. While there might still be some issues, they should be less frequent and less critical.
- We use the Preview phase as a final stress test to ensure the product is ready for heavy production workloads.

We recommend testing the product in a staging environment and welcome any feedback in our [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=inline_text). This will assist us in improving the product for its final release.

### General Availability

If a feature in the Prisma Data Platform is Generally Available:

- The solution has undergone extensive testing and, based on significant feedback, is deemed stable and ready for production use cases.
