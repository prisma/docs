Prisma Accelerate provides global caching for read queries using TTL, Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR), or a combination of both. It's included as part of Prisma Postgres, but can also be used with your own database by enabling Accelerate in the [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io?utm_source=docs) and [configuring it with your database](/accelerate/getting-started).
