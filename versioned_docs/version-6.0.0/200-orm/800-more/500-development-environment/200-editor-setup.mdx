This page describes how you can configure your editor for an optimal developer experience when using Prisma ORM.

If you don't see your editor here, please [open a feature request](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) and ask for dedicated support for your editor (e.g. for syntax highlighting and auto-formatting).

## VS Code extension

You can install the official [Prisma VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma). It adds extra capabilities to VS Code when developing applications with Prisma ORM:

- Syntax highlighting of `schema.prisma`
- Linting
  - Diagnostic tools are used to surface errors and warnings in your schema file as you type.
- Code Completion
  - Completion results appear for symbols as you type.
  - You can trigger this manually with the `Ctrl+Space` shortcut.
- Documentation help
  - Documentation of a completion result pops up as completion results are provided.
- Quick info on hover
  - Documentation Comments (`///`) of models and enums appear anywhere you hover over their usages.
- Go to Definition
  - Jump to or peek a model or enum's declaration.
- Formatting
  - Format code either manually or on save (if configured).
    - To automatically format on save, add the following to your `settings.json` file:    
      ```json
      "editor.formatOnSave": true
      ```
    - To enable formatting in combination with `prettier`, add the following to your `settings.json` file:or use the [Prettier plugin for Prisma](https://github.com/umidbekk/prettier-plugin-prisma)        
      ```json
      "[prisma]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "Prisma.prisma"
      },
      ```
- Rename
  - Rename models, enums, fields and enum values
    - Click into the model or enum, press `F2` and then type the new desired name and press `Enter`
    - All usages will be renamed
    - Automatically applies `@map` or `@@map` on the schema
- Quick-fixes
  - Quickly fix typos in model and enum names
  - Create new models and enums with a single click

:::tip

If you're using VS Code, you can use [VS Code agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode) to enter prompts such as “create Postgres database” or “apply schema migration” directly in the chat. The VS code agent handles all underlying Prisma CLI invocations and API calls automatically. See our [VS Code Agent documentation](/postgres/integrations/vscode#agent-mode) for more details.
