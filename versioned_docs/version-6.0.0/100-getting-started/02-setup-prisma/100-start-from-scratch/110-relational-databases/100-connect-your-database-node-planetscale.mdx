To connect your database, you need to set the `url` field of the `datasource` block in your Prisma schema to your database [connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls):

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma showLineNumbers
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

You will also need to set the relation mode type to `prisma` in order to [emulate foreign key constraints](/orm/overview/databases/planetscale#option-1-emulate-relations-in-prisma-client) in the `datasource` block:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add showLineNumbers
datasource db {
  provider     = "mysql"
  url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
  //add-next-line
  relationMode = "prisma"
}
```

> **Note**: Since February 2024, you can alternatively [use foreign key constraints on a database-level in PlanetScale](/orm/overview/databases/planetscale#option-2-enable-foreign-key-constraints-in-the-planetscale-database-settings), which omits the need for setting `relationMode = "prisma"`.

The `url` is [set via an environment variable](/orm/prisma-schema/overview#accessing-environment-variables-from-the-schema) which is defined in `.env`:

```bash file=.env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://janedoe:mypassword@server.us-east-2.psdb.cloud/mydb?sslaccept=strict"
```

You now need to adjust the connection URL to point to your own database.

The [format of the connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls) for your database typically depends on the database you use. PlanetScale uses the MySQL connection URL format, which has the following structure (the parts spelled all-uppercased are _placeholders_ for your specific connection details):

```no-lines
mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
```

Here's a short explanation of each component:

- `USER`: The name of your database user
- `PASSWORD`: The password for your database user
- `PORT`: The port where your database server is running (typically `3306` for MySQL)
- `DATABASE`: The name of the [database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-database.html)

For a database hosted with PlanetScale, the [connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls) looks similar to this:

```bash file=.env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://myusername:mypassword@server.us-east-2.psdb.cloud/mydb?sslaccept=strict"
```

The connection URL for a given database branch can be found from your PlanetScale account by going to the overview page for the branch and selecting the 'Connect' dropdown. In the 'Passwords' section, generate a new password and select 'Prisma' to get the Prisma format for the connection URL.

<summary>Alternative method: connecting using the PlanetScale CLI</summary>

Alternatively, you can connect to your PlanetScale database server using the [PlanetScale CLI](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/planetscale-environment-setup), and use a local connection URL. In this case the connection URL will look like this:

```bash file=.env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@localhost:PORT/mydb"
```

<Admonition type="info">

We recommend adding `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing your environment variables.

</Admonition>

To connect to your branch, use the following command:

```terminal
pscale connect prisma-test branchname --port PORT
```

The `--port` flag can be omitted if you are using the default port `3306`.
