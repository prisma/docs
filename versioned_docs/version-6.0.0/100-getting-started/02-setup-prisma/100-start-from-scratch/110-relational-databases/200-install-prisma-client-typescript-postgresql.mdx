These commands serve different purposes in managing your database schema with Prisma. Here’s a breakdown of when and why to use each:

#### `npx prisma migrate dev`

- **Purpose:** This command generates and applies a new migration based on your Prisma schema changes. It creates migration files that keep a history of changes.
- **Use Case:** Use this when you want to maintain a record of database changes, which is essential for production environments or when working in teams. It allows for version control of your database schema.
- **Benefits:** This command also includes checks for applying migrations in a controlled manner, ensuring data integrity.


#### `npx prisma db push`

- **Purpose:** This command is used to push your current Prisma schema to the database directly. It applies any changes you've made to your schema without creating migration files.
- **Use Case:** It’s particularly useful during the development phase when you want to quickly sync your database schema with your Prisma schema without worrying about migration history.
- **Caution:** It can overwrite data if your schema changes affect existing tables or columns, so it’s best for early-stage development or prototyping.
