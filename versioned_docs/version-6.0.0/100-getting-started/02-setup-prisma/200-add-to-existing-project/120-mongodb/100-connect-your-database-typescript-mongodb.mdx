## Connecting your database

To connect your database, you need to set the `url` field of the `datasource` block in your Prisma schema to your database [connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls):

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma showLineNumbers
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

In this case, the `url` is [set via an environment variable](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables) which is defined in `.env`:

```bash file=.env showLineNumbers
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://test:test@cluster0.ns1yp.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase"
```

You now need to adjust the connection URL to point to your own database.

The [format of the connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls) for your database depends on the database you use. For MongoDB, it looks as follows (the parts spelled all-uppercased are _placeholders_ for your specific connection details):

```no-lines
mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
```

Here's a short explanation of each component:

- `USERNAME`: The name of your database user
- `PASSWORD`: The password for your database user
- `HOST`: The host where a [`mongod`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod) (or [`mongos`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos)) instance is running
- `PORT`: The port where your database server is running (typically `27017` for MongoDB)
- `DATABASE`: The name of the database. Note that if you're using MongoDB Atlas, you need to manually append the database name to the connection URL because the environment link from MongoDB Atlas doesn't contain it.

## Troubleshooting

### `Error in connector: SCRAM failure: Authentication failed.`

If you see the `Error in connector: SCRAM failure: Authentication failed.` error message, you can specify the source database for the authentication by [adding](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/9994#discussioncomment-1562283) `?authSource=admin` to the end of the connection string.

### `Raw query failed. Error code 8000 (AtlasError): empty database name not allowed.`

If you see the `Raw query failed. Code: unknown. Message: Kind: Command failed: Error code 8000 (AtlasError): empty database name not allowed.` error message, be sure to append the database name to the database URL. You can find more info in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/docs/issues/5562).
