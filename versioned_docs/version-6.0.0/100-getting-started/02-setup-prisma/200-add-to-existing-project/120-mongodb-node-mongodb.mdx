Learn how to add Prisma ORM to an existing Node.js or TypeScript project by connecting it to your database and generating a Prisma Client for database access. The following tutorial introduces you to [Prisma CLI](/orm/tools/prisma-cli), [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client), and [Prisma Introspection](/orm/prisma-schema/introspection).

<Admonition type="tip">

If you're migrating to Prisma ORM from Mongoose, see our [Migrate from Mongoose guide](/guides/migrate-from-mongoose).

</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

In order to successfully complete this guide, you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine (see [system requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for officially supported versions)
- Access to a MongoDB 4.2+ server with a replica set deployment. We recommend using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

  <Admonition type="warning">

  The MongoDB database connector uses transactions to support nested writes. Transactions **requires** a [replica set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/) deployment. The easiest way to deploy a replica set is with [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/). It's free to get started.

  </Admonition>

Make sure you have your database [connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls) (that includes your authentication credentials) at hand! If you don't have a database server running and just want to explore Prisma ORM, check out the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-sqlite).

> See [System requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for exact version requirements.

## Set up Prisma ORM

As a first step, navigate into it your project directory that contains the `package.json` file.

Next, add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency to your project:

```terminal copy
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

:::note

If your project contains multiple directories with `package.json` files (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, etc.), note that Prisma ORM is specifically designed for use in the API/backend layer. To set up Prisma, navigate to the appropriate backend directory containing the relevant `package.json` file and configure Prisma there.
