## Overview

This page explains the release process of Prisma, how it's versioned and how to deal with breaking changes that might happen throughout releases.

## Releases

Prisma releases typically happen every two weeks. Note that this is _not_ a hard rule, releases might be postponed for internal reasons.

## Product maturity levels

A release can inclue products or features at different maturity levels. Maturity level describes a product or feature's completeness, and what users can expect in terms of breaking changes.

### Experiment

If a feature or product is an **experiment**:

- We want to test whether a problem genuinely exists and if a proposed prototype would solve it.
- We are not yet clear about whether we want to add it to the product surface.

Not recommended for production.

### Early Access

If a feature or product is **early access**:

- We have validated a problem and are considering a solution to it, but are not certain whether that solution is complete or a perfect fit.
- We want to gather more feedback and adjust the solution as necessary, knowing that users are prepared for significant breaking changes

Not recommended for production.

### Preview

If a feature or product is a **preview**:

- We have validated the feature or product in terms of direction and surface.
- Users can count on the feature or product and associated API to be mostly stable, unless stated otherwise in the release notes and documentation.
- There are no significant known issues, although smaller bugs may exist.
- We welcome feedback on these to make the solution stable as quickly as possible.

Previews are typically available behind a feature flag or require some form of opt-in (for example, by providing a `--preview-feature` flag in the CLI).

Not recommended for production.

### Generally Available (GA)

If a feature or product is **generally available**:

- The solution has been tested for some time and we received enough feedback to consider it stable and ready for production use.
- There should be no bugs in 99% of cases (completely bug-free software cannot be guaranteed)

## Versioning

Prisma's approach for versioning is inspired by Semantic Versioning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) but doesn't fully adhere to it.

### Prisma vs SemVer

#### How does SemVer versioning work?

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) uses the following rules for version upgrade (quoted from the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) spec):

_Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:_

1. _`MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,_
1. _`MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and_
1. _`PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes._

_Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format._

#### How does Prisma versioning work?

While Prisma releases follow the _format_ of the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) specification, it does **not** follow the rule that `MINOR` version updates must not have incompatible API changes (i.e. _breaking changes_). This means that there _might_ be breaking changes in any `2.X` release.

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, Prisma's version number is incremented as follows:

1. `MAJOR` version is incremented when major product updates (**likely with breaking changes**) are released,
1. `MINOR` version is incremented for minor product updates (**may have breaking API changes**) are released, and
1. `PATCH` version functionality is added or bugs are fixed (**backwards compatible**).

#### Why does Prisma not follow SemVer?

Prisma is one of many developer tools that doesn't follow the SemVer specification. The main reason is that Prisma has a huge developer surface made up by several tools (the Prisma CLI, Prisma Client, Prisma Migrate, Prisma Studio, ...). Therefore, a breaking change in one tool might not affect usage of another tool, so incrementing the major version number for the tools that are not affected might not be justified.
