## Overview

This page explains the release process of Prisma, how it's versioned and how to deal with breaking changes that might happen throughout releases.

## Releases

Prisma releases typically happen every two weeks. Note that this is _not_ a hard rule, releases might be postponed for internal reasons.

## Versioning

Prisma's approach for versioning is inspired by Semantic Versioning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) but doesn't fully adhere to it.

### Prisma vs SemVer

#### How does SemVer versioning work?

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) uses the following rules for version upgrade (quoted from the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) spec):

_Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:_

1. _`MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,_
1. _`MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and_
1. _`PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes._

_Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format._

#### How does Prisma versioning work?

While Prisma releases follow the _format_ of the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) specification, it does **not** follow the rule that `MINOR` version updates must not have incompatible API changes (i.e. _breaking changes_). This means that there _might_ be breaking changes in any `2.X` release.

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, Prisma's version number is incremented as follows:

1. `MAJOR` version is incremented when major product updates (**likely with breaking changes**) are released,
1. `MINOR` version is incremented for minor product updates (**may have breaking API changes**) are released, and
1. `PATCH` version functionality is added or bugs are fixed (**backwards compatible**).

#### Why does Prisma not follow SemVer?

Prisma is one of many developer tools that doesn't follow the SemVer specification. The main reason is that Prisma has a huge developer surface made up by several tools (the Prisma CLI, Prisma Client, Prisma Migrate, Prisma Studio, ...). Therefore, a breaking change in one tool might not affect usage of another tool, so incrementing the major version number for the tools that are not affected might not be justified.
