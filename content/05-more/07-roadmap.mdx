## Overview

Our roadmap helps us share our current priorities: what we are currently working on and what we are planning to work on in the near term. This reflects our _current plans_ today, and the content is subject to change at any time. Actual results and plans may differ as a result of changing our product strategy or reacting to demands from our user base.

## What's next?

### Modern database access with Prisma Client

[Prisma Client](../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/api) is a modern database access library for Node.js and TypeScript. It is an alternative to traditional ORMs and SQL query builders to read and write data in your database.

Prisma Client is currently in beta, and we are working towards a General Availability (GA) release.

### Schema migrations with Prisma Migrate

[Prisma Migrate](../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate) is a declarative database migration system. It lets you model your database via the Prisma schema and provides a CLI to map the Prisma schema to your database by generating the required SQL migration statements.

Prisma Migrate is already available as an experimental feature.

### JSON support

Some relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL have a `JSON` data type to store JSON text that follows the [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) spec.
