Currently, you can only use [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client) with the Data Proxy to _query_ your database.

When using Prisma CLI, you need a direct (non-Data Proxy) database connection if you apply schema changes to your database with [Prisma Migrate](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/get-started) or [`db push`](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push), or if you [introspect](/concepts/components/introspection) your database. See [Prisma CLI commands that require a direct database connection](#prisma-cli-commands-that-require-a-direct-database-connection).

In Prisma versions 4.10.0 and later, you can [set a direct database connection URL in your Prisma schema](#set-a-direct-database-connection-url-in-your-prisma-schema).

In earlier versions, you must add an [environment variable](/guides/development-environment/environment-variables) with the direct database connection URL and overwrite the [`DATABASE_URL` environment variable](/guides/development-environment/environment-variables#example-set-the-database_url-environment-variable-in-an-env-file) when you need a direct connection.

## Prisma CLI commands that require a direct database connection

The following [Prisma CLI commands](/reference/api-reference/command-reference) require a direct connection:

- `prisma db pull`
- `prisma migrate deploy`
- `prisma migrate dev`
- `prisma migrate diff` (some parameters only)
- `prisma migrate reset`
- `prisma migrate resolve`
- `prisma migrate status`
- `prisma db push`
- `prisma db drop`
- `prisma db execute`
- `prisma studio`

## Set a direct database connection URL in your Prisma schema

To provide a URL for a direct database connection, set the `directUrl` property in the [`datasource`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) block of your Prisma schema:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=8;add
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

<Admonition type="warn">

`prisma studio` currently doesn't support the `directUrl` property.

</Admonition>

Then add the `DIRECT_URL` environment variable to your [`.env` file](/guides/development-environment/environment-variables#using-env-files):

```env file=.env highlight=4-5;add
# Connection to Prisma Data Proxy. Used by Prisma Client.
DATABASE_URL="prisma://__HOST__/?api_key=__KEY__"

# Connection to the database. Used for migrations and introspection.
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__:__PORT__/__DATABASE__"
```
