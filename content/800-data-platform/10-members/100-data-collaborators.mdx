When you want to allow team members to do manual data management (add, edit, delete records), in a lot of cases you need to share the database connection string. Doing so involves granting extensive database privileges which requires taking into account security considerations and the correct configuration of database clients.

With the Prisma Data Platform, you can easily invite data collaborators by just adding their GitHub username to your project and assigning the **Collaborator** user role. After that, they can edit data directly from the **Data Browser** tab.

## Add data collaborators

You can add new data collaborators from the project settings.

**Prerequisites and considerations**

Only the project owner or another user with the **Admin** role can add new collaborators to a project.

**Steps**

1. Go to the [Projects](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page.
2. Select the project to which you want to add a collaborator.
3. From the **Projects** drop-down in the upper-left, select **Project settings**.
4. Click **Members**.
5. Type the GitHub username in the box and click **Invite Member**.
6. In the pop-up window, select **Collaborator** from the **Role** drop-down menu.
7. Click **Save**.

**Results**

- Your new project collaborator can now use their GitHub account to log in to [https://cloud.prisma.io](https://cloud.prisma.io).
- The collaborator can now open your project and edit data from the **Data Browser** tab.
- The collaborator can view and edit data in all environments for this project.
