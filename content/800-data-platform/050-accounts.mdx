To start using the Prisma Data Platform, you need to sign up with your GitHub account. When you do so, you authorize the Prisma GitHub app to read the list of repositories (to which you have granted access), and to read and create new repositories for new projects.

In addition to your GitHub account, you can also use your accounts for [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) when you want to to quickly provision a new database for your projects.

Any PlanetScale or Heroku account that you use with the Prisma Data Platform is a _linked account_. At any time, you can link only one PlanetScale and only one Heroku account. However, you can unlink any currently linked accounts and use others to quickly provision databases.

## Linked accounts

A _linked account_ is a PlanetScale or Heroku account that you use to provision databases for your projects in the Prisma Data Platform.

### Link a PlanetScale or Heroku account

When you create a new project from the [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page, you can select to provision a new database from PlanetScale or Heroku.

To do so, you must have an account for either platform and use that to log in and then do the database provisioning.

After you log in to either platform, the account becomes a linked account in the Prisma Data Platform.

### View your linked accounts

You can view your linked PlanetScale and Heroku accounts when your profile in the upper-right corner and select **Manage integrations**.

All linked accounts appear on the _Integrations_ page under _Linked accounts_.

### Unlink a PlanetScale or Heroku account

At any point in time, you can have only 1 PlanetScale and only 1 Heroku linked account in the Prisma Data Platform.

To use another PlanetScale or Heroku account to provision the database for a project, you can unlink the currently linked account for the respective platform.

**Note**<br /><br />
Unlinking an account does not in any way impact the databases that you provisioned with it.
