To switch to another database in one of your project's [environments](/data-platform/environments), you can change the database connection string for the environment.

<Admonition type="alert">

Allow several minutes for the new connection string to take effect before you test your new database.

## Prerequisites

- You must have the [Project owner](/data-platform/members/roles-permissions) or [Admin](/data-platform/members/roles-permissions) role for the project to edit a database connection string for any of the environments.

## Steps

1. In the Prisma Data Platform, open a project.
2. In the upper left, click the **Projects** drop-down and select **Project settings**.
3. Select the **Environments** tab.
4. Click the three-dot menu for an environment and select **Settings**.
5. In **Connection string**, paste a new connection string.
6. (Optional) If your database is behind a firewall and you can only configure external access from specific IP addresses, then from **Static IPs**, select **Enabled**. Copy the IP addresses and add them to the allowlist of your database.
7. Click **Update Database Connection**.
