You can edit the following settings for any [environment](/data-platform/environments) in a project:

- environment name
- environment URL handle
- set an environment as the default

<Admonition type="alert">

**Important**<br /><br />

You cannot change the Data Proxy location or the database connection string after you create an environment. You can do both only when you create a new environment.
