For each environment of a project, you can edit its settings.

* environment name
* environment URL handle
* database connection string and access to it via static IPs
* change the default environment

**Important**<br /><br />

You cannot change the Data Proxy location after you create an environment. You can select a different Data Proxy location only when you create a new environment.
