You can edit the following settings for any [environment](/data-platform/environments) in a project:

- environment name
- environment URL handle
- database connection string and access to it with static IPs
- set it as the default environment

<Admonition type="alert">

**Important**<br /><br />

You cannot change the Data Proxy location after you create an environment. You can select a different Data Proxy location only when you create a new environment.
