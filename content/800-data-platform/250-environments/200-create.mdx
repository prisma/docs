<TopBlock>

For any project in the Prisma Data Platform, you can create multiple [environments](/data-platform/environments) and associate each environment with a different database, a Data Proxy region, and a different branch of your GitHub repository.

You can use environments to isolate database development activities with separate branches and databases, and dedicate each environment to an activity, such as Development, Staging, and Production, and so on.

</TopBlock>

## Prerequisites

- You are the [Project owner](/data-platform/members/user-roles) or have the [Admin](/data-platform/members/user-roles) role for the project to create a new environment for a project.
- Create a new branch in your GitHub repository.
- Obtain a database connection string for the new environment.
- Based on your [project plan quota](/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas), check if you have capacity for more environments.

## Steps

1.  From the **Environments** drop-down menu, select **Create new environment**.

    />

2.  In **Environment Name**, enter a name for the environment.

    <Admonition>

    **Note**<br /><br />
    Use any naming convention that makes sense for your project.<br /><br />
    If applicable, you can use the Staging, Development, or &lt;Feature name&gt; conventions to dedicate an environment to a database development workflow or to the development of a specific feature.

    </Admonition>

3.  From **Branch**, select the branch of the project repository that you want to use for the new environment.

    <Admonition type="alert">

    **Note**<br /><br />

    You must select a branch from the repository that you configured on the Production environment.<br /><br />

    Because of this, you cannot select a different repository when you create a new environment.

    </Admonition>

4.  In **Prisma Schema path**, enter the path to the `schema.prisma` file.

    <Admonition>

    **Note**<br /><br />

    The pre-filled path `prisma/schema.prisma` is the default path. Change it to the path you plan to use in the environment.

    </Admonition>

5.  In **Connection string**, paste the database connection string for the new environment.
6.  Under **Data Proxy**, from the **Location** drop-down menu, select the geographic location for the Data Proxy.

          <Admonition>

    **Note**<br /><br />

    Select a Data Proxy location that is close to the geographic location of the database for the new environment.<br /><br />
    If you select a location that is geographically distant from the database, then when your application sends requests to the database through the Data Proxy, you might notice some delay in the responses.

          </Admonition>

    <Admonition type="alert">

    **Important**<br /><br />

    After you create an environment, you cannot change its Data Proxy location. You can select a different Data Proxy location only when you create a new environment.

          </Admonition>

7.  (Optional) From **Static IPs**, select **Enabled** if your database is behind a firewall and you can only configure external access from specific IP addresses. Copy the IP addresses and add them to the allowlist of your database.

    <Admonition>

    **Note**<br /><br />

    For more information, see [Static egress IP address](/data-platform/static-ips).

    </Admonition>

8.  Click **Create Environment**.

      width="450px"
    />

## Result

The environment is added to the project and appears in the **Environments** drop-down menu.

## What's next

You can switch between the environments of a project from the **Environments** drop-down menu in the upper left (next to the **Projects** drop-down).

- After you switch to a different environment, the **Data Browser** and **Query Console** use the database and Data Proxy location configured that the environment.
- The **Schema Viewer** tab shows the Prisma schema from the repository branch that you selected for the environment.
