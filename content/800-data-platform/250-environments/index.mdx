For any project in the Prisma Data Platform, you can create multiple environments. You can associate each environment with a different database, Data Proxy location, and a different branch of your GitHub repository.

## About environments in the Prisma Data Platform

You can dedicate each environment to a different stage of your database application life-cycle, such as production, staging, development, or any others that make sense for your project.

For each environment in a [project](/data-platform/projects), you define:

- a GitHub branch (based on the repository of the Production environment)
- a database connection string
- a Data Proxy region

## Default environment

When you first [add a project](/data-platform/projects/add-project), you define the default environment of the project. The default environment has the name **Production**.

When you or your team members open the project, you always start on the default **Production** environment. You can see the name of your current environment in the **Environments** drop-down menu in the upper left.

Until you add another environment and switch to that, the activity that you and your team members carry out in the **Data Browser**, **Query Console**, and **Schema Viewer** occurs in the **Production** environment.

- When you manipulate data in the **Date Browser** or run queries in the **Query Console**, you do so on the database and the Data Proxy region that are defined in the **Production** environment.
- When you view the Prisma schema in the **Schema Viewer**, you do so for the Prisma schema file from the GitHub repository and branch defined in the **Production environment**.

After you [add more environments](/data-platform/environments/create), you can switch to another environment from the **Environments** drop-down menu.
