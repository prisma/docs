In the Prisma Data Platform, you can use the **Schema Viewer** to:

* view the contents of the Prisma schema file for the currently selected environment of a Prisma project
* manage how the Prisma schema is linked and updated for the currently selected environment

## About Schema Viewer

After you create a project, the **Schema Viewer** can show different options and these depend on whether you enabled schema synchronization and whether the database was empty.

* [**Projects with schema synchronization**](#projects-with-schema-synchronization). For such projects, **Schema Viewer** shows the latest version of your Prisma schema with details about the GitHub repository and branch and the time when the schema was last updated. This means that when you created your project or after that, you enabled schema synchronization from GitHub and the platform can automatically read the updates of the `schema.prisma` file and keep that up-to-date in **Schema Viewer**.
* [**Projects with an introspected schema**](#projects-with-an-introspected-schema). For such projects, **Schema Viewer** shows the Prisma schema from when the platform last introspected your database. For such projects, you can manually trigger a new schema introspection and you can also decide to setup schema synchronization from GitHub.
* [**Projects without a schema**](#projects-without-a-schema). Such projects had an empty database (no models or collections) when you created the project and **Schema Viewer** provides the option to enable schema synchronization.

## Projects with schema synchronization

When you have schema synchronization enabled for your project, **Schema Viewer** shows the contents of the most recent version of your Prisma schema file as synched from the GitHub repository and branch for the currently selected project environment.

You can view information about:

* GitHub repository and branch
* last time the Prisma schema was synchronized in the platform
* Prisma schema file path

When you push a new version of Prisma schema to the relevant GitHub repository and branch, the platform detects the change and updates the schema. This keeps the contents in **Schema Viewer** up-to-date and updates the models in [**Data Browser**](/data-platform/data-browser) and [**Query Console**](/data-platform/query-console) so that you and your team always work with the latest models and attributes in your database.

## Projects with an introspected schema

If you create a project with a database that contains some models and data and do not enable schema synchronization, the platform introspects the database and generates a Prisma schema for the project.

For such projects, **Schema Viewer** shows the generated Prisma schema at the bottom and provides the option to enable schema synchronization at the top.

If you do not plan to enable schema synchronization from a GitHub repository for the project, you can work with the generated Prisma schema at the bottom. If you have made changes to your database after the platform first introspected it, you can start a new introspection when you click **Refresh Schema**. With this action, the platform introspects your database again and generates and updates the Prisma schema in **Schema Viewer**.

<Admonition type="alert">

**Important**<br /><br />

You can use the **Refresh Schema** option only if you are the [Project owner](/data-platform/members/user-roles) or an [Admin](/data-platform/members/user-roles) on the project.

## Projects without a schema

If you create your project with an empty database (one which contains no models) and do not enable schema synchronization, the platform tries to introspect the database but because that contains no models, the platform cannot generate an initial Prisma schema for it.

For such projects, **Schema Viewer** does not show a schema and provides the option to link a Prisma schema from a GitHub repository.

  alt="Schema Viewer - Projects with no models and no Prisma schema"
/>

For such projects, [**Data Browser**](/data-platform/data-browser) and [**Query Console**](/data-platform/query-console) remain inactive until you enable schema synchronization.

## Enable schema synchronization

For projects [without a schema](#projects-without-a-schema) or [with an introspected schema](#projects-with-an-introspected-schema), you can enable automated schema synchronization with the provided options.

### Prerequisites

To enable schema synchronization from GitHub, you must be the [Project owner](/data-platform/members/user-roles) or have the [Admin](/data-platform/members/user-roles) role.

### Steps

1. From **GitHub Account**, select a GitHub account or organization.
2. From **Repository**, select a repository.
3. From **Branch**, select the branch that you want to use for the currently selected environment.
4. (Optional) If you have a non-default path for your Prisma schema, define that in **Prisma schema path**.
5. Click **Link Prisma schema**.

### Result

Your Prisma schema is now linked to your current project environment.

[**Data Browser**](/data-platform/data-browser) and [**Query Console**](/data-platform/query-console) are now active and you and your team members can now use them.
