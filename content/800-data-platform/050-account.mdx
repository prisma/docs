To start using the Prisma Data Platform, you need to sign up with your GitHub account. When you do so, you authorize the Prisma GitHub app to read the list of repositories (to which you have granted access), and to read and create new repositories for new projects.

## Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform

When you first go to the [Prisma Data Platform](https://cloud.prisma.io), use **Sign in with GitHub** to sign up.

If your sign up is successful, you can start by [creating your first project](/data-platform/projects/add-project).
