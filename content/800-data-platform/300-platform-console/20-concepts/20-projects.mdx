Projects embody your applications integrated with our products. Each project is associated with a Workspace and can be configured independently from one another.

## API Keys

A project API key is required to authenticate requests from your Prisma Client to products such as Accelerate and Pulse. You may generate multiple API keys per project and manage those via the **Settings** tab of a project's page.
