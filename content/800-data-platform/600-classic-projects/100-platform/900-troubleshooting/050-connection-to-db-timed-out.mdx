## **Problem**

The error _Connection your database timed out_ appears when you use **Data Browser** or **Query Console**.

## **Cause**

When you use **Data Browser** or **Query Console**, the default timeout for requests sent to the database is `15ms`. If a response is not available within this limit, the error appears.

Several reasons related to Data Proxy or database configuration might cause this issue.

### **Causes related to Data Proxy**

- The time added to a request because it is routed through Data Proxy pushed the timeout beyond the limit
- The database and Data Proxy are in different geographic locations

### **Causes related to the response size, database, and network latency**

- The time it took the database to process the query pushed it over the timeout limit
- The payload response is large and could not be processed within the timeout limit
- The depth of the query is large (it includes mutliple relational fields)

## **Solution**

While you can do little to impact potential Data Proxy or network latency, you can start with one of the following solutions.

- Retry the operation in **Data Browser** or the query in **Query Console** and see if it completes successfully.
- Configure your Data Proxy to be closer to or in the same location as the database.

  **Note**<br /><br />
  You can do so only by creating a new environment in which you can specify a different Data Proxy location.
