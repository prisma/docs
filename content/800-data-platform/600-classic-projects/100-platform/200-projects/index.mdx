A _project_ in the Prisma Data Platform is an organizational unit for your JavaScript/TypeScript application that uses Prisma ORM.

You use projects to manage:

- [environments](../environments)
  - your linked GitHub repository and branch
  - your database connection string
  - your Data Proxy region
- [members](../members)
- [paid plan and billing](../billing/plans-and-quotas)

In the Prisma Data Platform, to [create projects](./create), you only need to provide the connection string for your database. You can also select a Data Proxy region for the project, and if necessary, you can configure database access from the supported [static IPs](/data-platform/classic-projects/platform/static-ips) of the platform.

For each project, you can edit the project name and URL handle, and when you no longer need a project, you can delete it.

- [Edit project settings](./edit-settings)
- [Delete a project](./delete-project)

You can view all of your existing projects on the [**Projects**](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page. Projects are grouped in the list based on their [plan](../billing/plans-and-quotas) in the following order:

1. [Scale](../billing/plans-and-quotas#strongscalestrong-plan)
2. [Free](../billing/plans-and-quotas#strongfreestrong-plan)

Within each group, project names are sorted in alphabetical order.
