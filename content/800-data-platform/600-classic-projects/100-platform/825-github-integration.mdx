The [Prisma app for GitHub](https://github.com/apps/prisma) provides an integration between Prisma Data Platform and GitHub. With this integration, you can use your GitHub account to sign up and create an account for Prisma Data Platform, and enable Prisma schema synchronization for a project (if you push your schema to a GitHub repository).

## About the Prisma app for GitHub

When you first link a Prisma schema from a GitHub repository to a project, you install the Prisma app for GitHub. When you install the app, you provide a set of permissions to the app to read your GitHub account data as well as permissions to read all of your GitHub repositories. Specifically, you grant the permissions listed below.

- Read access to the administration, code, and metadata of all your GitHub repositories ([you can later select to do so only for specific repositories](#grant-prisma-app-access-only-to-selected-repositories))
- Read access to the email address of your GitHub account

## Install the Prisma GitHub app

3. On the **Installed GitHub Apps** tab, click **Configure** for the Prisma app.
