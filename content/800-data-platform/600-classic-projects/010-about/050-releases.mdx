This page explains how we consider maturity levels for features of the [Prisma Data Platform](https://cloud.prisma.io).

## Releases

Prisma releases updates to the Prisma Data Platform multiple times per week, as opposed to the Prisma ORM that we release on a set schedule every few weeks. This is why we consider the lifecycle and process for maturing features in the Prisma Data Platform differently.

You can [check out the releases and maturity process for the Prisma ORM](/about/prisma/releases) for further details.
