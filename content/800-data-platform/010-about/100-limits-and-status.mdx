## General limits in the Prisma Data Platform

The table below provides a list of general limits that the Prisma Data Platform has in place.

| Limit type                                                                                                                                                            | Value          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Maximum number of projects on the **Free** plan per account<br /><br /><br />**Note**<br /><br /> The number does not include projects on the **Early Adopter** plan. | 10             |
| Maximum number of projects per account                                                                                                                                | 100            |

## Concurrency limits of the Data Proxy

The concurrency limits of the Data Proxy define the maximum number of proxy instances that can run simultaneously for a single project. By default, at least one proxy instance is started for a single project environment and additional instances are started when an increase in traffic demands that.

In addition, more proxy instances start for a project environment under these circumstances:

- multiple Prisma Clients connect that use a different version of the Prisma Client
- multiple Prisma Clients connect that use a different version of the Prisma schema

| Concurrency limits                                                                                         | Number  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Early Adopter** plan                                     | 3       |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Free** plan                                              | 16      |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Scale** plan                                             | 16      |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Enterprise** plan                                        | Custom  |
| Approximate maximum queries per second with 16 proxy instances\*<br /><br />(**Free** and **Scale** plans) | ~19,200 |

<Admonition>

**Note**<br /><br /> \* The number in the last row does not take into account the complexity of the queries.<br /><br />Complex queries which might require multiple database operations might not reach the maximum numbers and might slow down other queries waiting for a database connection.

## Compatibility with Prisma ORM

We are dedicated to keeping the Prisma Data Platform compatible with the latest version of the Prisma ORM.

- **Compatibility of the platform Data Browser, Query Console, Schema with the Prisma ORM**
  - The interfaces are updated after each Prisma ORM release and aim to support the latest version.
  - In rare occasions, there might be several days worth of a delay before the interfaces begin to support the latest version of the Prisma ORM.
- **Compatibility of the Data Proxy with the Prisma ORM**
  - Data Proxy is updated almost immediately to the latest version of the Prisma ORM.
  - Data Proxy does not yet support the preview features `interactiveTransactions`, `metrics`, and `tracing`.

## Availability and SLO

The [Prisma Status](https://www.prisma-status.com/) page displays the following information:

- current status of the platform
- current and historical uptime of the Data Proxy in all supported locations
- current and historical uptime of the web interface and the GraphQL API used to provide the features in https://cloud.prisma.io
- log of past incidents

The SLO (service-level objective) of the Prisma Data Platform is to provide at least 99.95% availability.
