This page explains how we consider maturity levels for features of the [Prisma Data Platform](https://cloud.prisma.io).

</TopBlock>

## Releases

Prisma releases updates to the Prisma Data Platform multiple times per week, as opposed to the Prisma ORM that we release on a set schedule every few weeks. This is why we consider the lifecycle and process for maturing features in the Prisma Data Platform differently.

You can [check out the releases and maturity process for the Prisma ORM](/about/prisma/releases) for further details.

## Maturity levels

### Early Access

If a feature on the Prisma Data Platform is labeled as **Early Access**:

- We have validated a problem and are considering a solution to it but are not certain whether that solution is complete or a perfect fit.
- We want to gather more feedback and adjust the solution as necessary, knowing that users are prepared for significant breaking changes
- We reserve ourselves the right to throttle or remove access to a feature in Early Access to preserve the stability of the platform, or enforcing its use to stay within the scope defined in our [Terms of Services](https://pris.ly/privacy).

As always, your feedback is invaluable to shape the design of the features so that it can solve your problem in the best way possible.

### General Availability

If a feature in the Prisma Data Platform is Generally Available:

- The solution has been tested for some time and we received enough feedback to consider it stable and ready for production use.
- The feature meets our [availability and SLO standards](/data-platform/about/limits-and-status#availability-and-slo).
