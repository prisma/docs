In the Prisma Data Platform, the **Schema** tab shows the contents of the Prisma schema file for the currently selected environment of a Prisma project.

If you select another environment which uses a separate branch or repository, the **Schema** tab shows the schema file from that branch or repository.

The **Schema** tab also shows the last time when the schema file was pulled from the repository in the `Last pulled from GitHub 9 days ago` line. The Prisma Data Platform updates the schema file contents as soon at it detects a change in the repository.
