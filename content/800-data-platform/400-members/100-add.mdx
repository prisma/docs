In Prisma Data Platform, you can invite team members to a project with their GitHub username.

## Prerequisites

- You are the [Project owner](/data-platform/members/roles-permissions) or have the [Admin](/data-platform/members/roles-permissions) role.
- The new team member must have a GitHub account and must have used that to log in to the platform.
- Obtain their GitHub username.
- Check your [project plan](/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas) and see if you have enough quota to add new team members.

## Steps

1. From the [Projects](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page, select the project to which you want to add a team member.
2. From the **Projects** drop-down in the upper-left, select **Project settings**.
3. Click **Team members**.
4. Enter the GitHub username in the box and click **Invite team member**.
5. In the pop-up window, select a [role](/data-platform/members/roles-permissions) for the new team member from the **Role** drop-down menu.
