Prisma Data Platform supports role-based access (RBAC) to projects.

</TopBlock>

## Roles

Except for the role of Project owner, you can assign any of the roles below to team members.

- Project owner
- Admin
- Developer
- Collaborator
- Viewer

To add users, you need to use their GitHub username and they need to have an account in the platform.

## Permissions

Each role has a fixed set of permissions. When you assign a role to a team member, you grant them the set of permissions that applies to the role. The table below shows the permissions for each role.
