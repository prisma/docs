<TopBlock>

Projects represent your applications that use Prisma ORM. Each individual project is associated with an **[Organization](./organizations)** and may be configured separately from the other projects in that organization.

</TopBlock>

## View an organization's projects

On the **Overview** section of your organization you will see a list of the projects associated with that organization. Clicking any of these projects will bring you into that project's details.

A project's details page is where you can:

- View the project's settings
- Generate project API keys
- Configure applications such as [Pulse](/data-platform/pulse/what-is-pulse) and [Accelerate](/data-platform/accelerate/what-is-accelerate) in your project

## Project API Keys

A project API key is required to validate requests from Prisma Client to products such as Accelerate and Pulse. You may generate multiple project API keys per project and manage those via the **Settings** tab of a project's page.

### View API keys

Within a project's **Settings** tab, you can find your existing project API keys under the **Project API keys** tab.

You can also get to this section from the project page's **Dashboard** view by hitting the **Manage API keys** link if your project has any associated API keys.

### Create an API key

Project API keys can be created within the **Settings** section of a project's details page under the **Project API keys** tab.

Once on this tab, click the **New API Key** button.

You will be prompted for a name for the new API key. After filling in that field, click **Create API Key**.

<Admonition type="info">

The generated API key is only accessible when it is first created, so be sure to copy it and store it in a safe place before closing the popup or clicking **I've stored it securely**.

</Admonition>

### Use an API key

A project API key must be provided to validate requests through products such as Accelerate and Pulse. With an API key in place, Prisma will be able to validate requests and associate usage with the project the project API key belongs to.

Below are examples of how to use a project API key with each product:

#### Accelerate

Accelerate requires your project API key to be passed via the `prisma://` connection string as a URL parameter.

To apply your project API key to an Accelerate connection string, add the `api_key` parameter with the API key as the value:

```shell
# .env
ACCELERATE_URL=prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=__API_KEY__
```

<Admonition type="info">

For more information about setting up and using Accelerate, see the [Accelerate documentation](/data-platform/accelerate/getting-started).

</Admonition>

#### Pulse

Pulse requires the project API key to be passed when extending Prisma Client with the `withPulse` client extension.

To apply your project API key, create an environment variable that holds your API key:

```shell
# .env
PRISMA_API_KEY=__API_KEY__
```

Then use that environment variable when initializing the `withPulse` extension by providing it as the value of the argument object's `apiKey` field:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({
    apiKey: process.env.PRISMA_API_KEY,
  })
)
```

<Admonition type="info">

For more information about setting up and using Pulse, see the [Pulse documentation](/data-platform/pulse/getting-started).

</Admonition>

### Delete an API key

To delete an API key, head into the **Settings** tab of your project and select the **Project API keys** tab on that page.

The table here displays all of your API keys associated with the selected project. This table's **Action** column contains a trash can symbol for each record. Clicking this symbol on any record will open a popup asking if you are sure you want to delete the project API key.

Click **Remove API key** to remove the key.

<Admonition type="warning">

Deleting an API key is irreversible. Any applications using that API key will need to be updated to a valid key to continue functioning as expected.

</Admonition>

## Settings

In a project's **Settings** page, you can:

- Update a project's name
- Delete a project
- Manage a project's API keys (see [Project API Keys](/data-platform/cloud-projects/platform/projects#project-api-keys))

In the **General** tab of the settings page, you will find an input field labeled **Project name**. You can update the name of your project by filling in this field and clicking **Update**.

You can also get to this section from the project page's **Dashboard** tab by hitting the **Manage API keys** link if your project has any associated API keys.

### Delete a project

You can also delete a project from the **Settings** page. On the **General** tab of any project's settings, click **Delete project**. You will then be prompted whether or not you really want to delete the project.

Deleting a project will delete all project API keys associated with that project and remove any database connection strings stored with that project.

<Admonition type="warning">Deleting a project is irreversible.</Admonition>

## Accelerate

Within each Cloud Project you can set up and configure Accelerate, Prisma's global database cache.

<Admonition type="info">

Accelerate is currently in Preview. If you want to learn more about it, check out the [Accelerate webpage](/data-platform/accelerate) and read the [Accelerate documentation](/data-platform/accelerate/what-is-accelerate).

</Admonition>

### Configure Accelerate

To set up Accelerate in your project, enter the **Accelerate** tab on your project's details page.

Alternatively, if you have been given access to Accelerate, you can click **Configure Accelerate** under the **Get Started** section of your project's **Dashboard** page.

The form on the **Accelerate** tab will prompt you for two pieces of information needed to set up Accelerate:

1. Your database connection string
2. The region where you would like to host Accelerate's data proxy

<Admonition type="info">

It is recommended to choose a region closest to your database as this will minimize latency between the data proxy and the database itself.

</Admonition>

Once those fields are filled in, click **Configure Accelerate** at the bottom of the form. This will configure Accelerate to be used by your project.

After this completes, the view will display [instructions](/data-platform/accelerate/what-is-accelerate) on how to begin using Accelerate in your application.

Specifically, you will be prompted to:

1. Copy the Accelerate connection string
2. Set up Accelerate in your application
3. Get a [Project API Key](/data-platform/cloud-projects/platform/projects#project-api-keys) if you do not already have one to use in your Accelerate connection string

### Disable Accelerate

At any time, you may disable Accelerate and no longer use it in your project. To do this, head to the **Accelerate** tab of your project's **Dashboard** page.

On this tab, if Accelerate is already enabled you will see a **Disable Accelerate** button on the top right of the page.

Clicking this button and accepting the resulting prompt will disable Accelerate, making it unusable by the associated project.

### View Accelerate usage

If Accelerate is configured for your project, you will find a **View usage** link on the top right of the Accelerate page next to the **Disable Accelerate** button.

Clicking this link will take you to the **Usage** section of the organization the project is associated with.

See [Usage](/data-platform/cloud-projects/platform/organizations#usage) for details about the metrics available in your organization's **Usage** section.

## Pulse

Within each Cloud Project you can set up and configure Pulse, Prisma's manage [change data capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) (CDC) service.

### Configure Pulse

To set up Pulse in your project, enter the **Pulse** tab on your project's details page.

<Admonition type="info">

This option will look slightly different if you have not yet been given Early Access to Pulse. In that scenario the link's text will change and will take you to the Pulse webpage.

</Admonition>

Alternatively, if you have been given access to Pulse, you can click **Configure Pulse** under the **Get Started** section of your project's **Dashboard** page.

On this page, there are two important sections with instructions to follow to set up Pulse:

#### Prepare your database

First is the **Prepare your database** section. Here, a set of instructions are defined that guide you on preparing your database for supporting real-time functionality.

These configurations are not Prisma-specific, but rather are database configurations Pulse relies on. For more detailed instructions, see the [Pulse documentation](/data-platform/pulse/what-is-pulse).

<Admonition type="info">

Pulse currently works with PostgreSQL databases and MySQL support is coming soon.

</Admonition>

#### Configure Pulse

This section will prompt you for two pieces of information needed to set up Pulse:

1. Your database connection string
2. The region where you would like to host Pulse

<Admonition type="info">

It is recommended to choose a region closest to your database as this will minimize latency between Pulse and the database itself.

</Admonition>

Once those fields are filled in, click **Configure Pulse** at the bottom of the form. This will configure Pulse to be used by your project.

After this completes, the view will display [instructions](/data-platform/pulse/what-is-pulse) on how to begin using Pulse in your application.

Specifically, you will be prompted to:

1. Get a [Project API Key](/data-platform/cloud-projects/platform/projects#project-api-keys) if you do not already have one to use in the Pulse extension
2. Set up Pulse in your application

### Disable Pulse

At any time, you may disable Pulse and no longer use it in your project. To do this, head to the **Pulse** tab of your project's **Dashboard** page.

On this tab, if Pulse is already enabled you will see a **Disable Pulse** button on the top right of the page. Clicking this button will open a panel with instructions on the changes that should be made to your database to drop the replication slot Pulse was configured to use.

Once that change is made, clicking the **Disable Pulse** button on that panel will disable Pulse, making it unusable by the associated project.
