## Sign in / Sign up

Cloud Projects uses your GitHub account to sign in and sign up for the platform. On the Cloud Projects login screen, click the **Continue with GitHub** button to sign in or sign up.

When you sign in for the first time, you will be asked to authorize Prisma on your GitHub account:

/>

Click **Authorize Prisma** to give Cloud Projects access to the email address associated with your GitHub account. This is what is used to identify your account within the Cloud Projects platform.
