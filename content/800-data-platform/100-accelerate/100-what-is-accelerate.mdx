[Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate) is a global database cache available in 280 locations that you can use to achieve up to 1000x faster database queries.

It provides easy access to a globally distributed cache and scalable connection pool for serverless applications via a powerful API. The goal of Accelerate is to improve response times and reduce database load. It works by caching data at the edge using established caching patterns that you control.

While Accelerate is beneficial for all types of applications, being at the edge provides additional benefits to edge function environments like [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions), [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), and [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). Cache hits can be served from data centers near the user regardless of the region of the database.

Accelerate is in [Early Access](https://www.prisma.io/docs/data-platform/about/releases#early-access). While we have high confidence in our product, the nature of an Early Access product is that significant iterations might happen at any time, so we would advise against placing it in a system that requires stability.

<Admonition type="info">

All database queries not served from the cache (eg: write queries, cache misses, etc.) are routed through a [database connection pool](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/database-tools/connection-pooling#what-is-connection-pooling). Currently, this infrastructure is only available in two regions: West Virginia and Ireland. In case the database is hosted far away from the Accelerate infrastructure, latency for queries to the database might be negatively affected. We are working on adding support for more regions.
