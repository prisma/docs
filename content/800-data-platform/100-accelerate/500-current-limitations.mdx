Below are descriptions of known limitations when using Accelerate. If you are aware of any limitations that are missing, please let us know on the [#accelerate-feedback](https://prisma.slack.com/archives/C04KTN0V2Q0) channel in our community Slack.

## Cannot cache raw queries

At the moment, it is not possible to cache the responses of [raw queries](/concepts/components/prisma-client/raw-database-access).

## Not compatible with the fluent API

Client Extensions (which are used in Accelerate) currently do not correctly forward the [fluent API](/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries#fluent-api) types. We hope to get a fix into Client Extensions soon.
