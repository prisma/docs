Below are descriptions of known limitations when using Accelerate. If you are aware of any limitations that are missing, please let us know on the [#accelerate-feedback](https://prisma.slack.com/archives/C04KTN0V2Q0) channel in our community Slack.

## Cannot cache raw queries

At the moment, it is not possible to cache the responses of [raw queries](/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/raw-database-access).

## Connection pool is hosted in one region: West Virginia

All database queries not served from the cache (eg: write queries, cache misses, etc.) are routed through a [database connection pool](/dataguide/database-tools/connection-pooling#what-is-connection-pooling), similar to the [Prisma Data Proxy](/docs/data-platform/data-proxy).

Currently, this infrastructure is only available in one region: West Virginia. In case the database is hosted far away from the Accelerate infrastructure, latency for queries to the database might be negatively affected. We are working on adding support for more regions.

## Not compatible with the fluent API

Client Extensions (which are used in Accelerate) currently do not correctly forward the fluent API types. We hope to get a fix into Client Extensions soon.
