## Prerequisites

To get started with Accelerate, you will need the following:

- A GitHub account.
- A project that uses [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client) `4.16.1` or higher. (If your project is using interactive transactions, you need to use `5.1.1` or higher.)
- A hosted PostgreSQL, MySQL, PlanetScale, CockroachDB, or MongoDB database.

## 1. Enable Accelerate in a Cloud Project

In order to enable Accelerate, you can [log in to Prisma Data Platform and create a new Cloud Project](https://pris.ly/pdp). Follow the instructions in the UI to add Accelerate.

For further information on each individual step, you can find additional documentation [here](/data-platform/cloud-projects/platform/projects#configure-accelerate).

At the end of the setup process, you'll obtain a connection string that connects to Accelerate. This connection string also contains an API key that you need to use when configuring Prisma Client to use Accelerate.

## 2. Use Accelerate in your application

To get started using Accelerate, ensure you’re using Prisma Client `4.16.1` or higher.

### 2.1. Update your database connection string

After enabling Accelerate in your Cloud Project and creating a new API key, you should be given an Accelerate connection string.

To use this connection string, update the `datasource` block's `url` field in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Most likely, as shown above, your database connection string in defined in a `.env` file rather than hard-coded into the schema file.

Update that variable to use the new Accelerate connection string:

```shell
# .env
# __API_KEY__ is a unique API key that Accelerate generates and automatically assigns to a project.
DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=__API_KEY__"

# Previous connection string
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/db_name?schema=public"
```

Prisma Migrate and Prisma Studio do not work with a `prisma://` connection string. In order to continue using these features add a new variable to the `.env` file named `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` whose value is the direct database connection string:

```shell highlight=3;add
# .env
DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=__API_KEY__"
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/db_name?schema=public"
```

Then in your Prisma schema's `datasource` block add a field named `directUrl` with the following:

```prisma highlight=4;add
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Prisma Migrate and Prisma Studio will use the `directUrl` connection string rather than the one defined in `url` when this configuration is provided.

### 2.2. Install the Accelerate Prisma Client extension

Run the following command to install the Accelerate extension for Prisma Client:

```shell
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

If your Prisma version is below `4.16.1`, enable the Prisma Client extension feature:

```prisma
/// prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

### 2.3. Generate Prisma Client for Accelerate

Run the following command to generate Prisma Client for Accelerate:

```shell
npx prisma generate --accelerate
```

<Admonition type="warning">

If your Prisma version is below `5.0.0`, generate Prisma Client with the `--data-proxy` option:

```shell
npx prisma generate --data-proxy
```

</Admonition>

### 2.4. Extend your Prisma Client instance to add the Accelerate extension

To use Accelerate, you must extend Prisma Client with the Accelerate extension.
Extend your Prisma Client instance to add the Accelerate extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
```

If you are going to deploy to an edge runtime (like Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, Deno Deploy, or Netlify Edge Functions), use our edge client instead:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
```

If VS Code does not recognize the `$extends` method, refer to [this section](/data-platform/accelerate/faq#vs-code-does-not-recognize-the-extends-method) on how to resolve the issue.

<Admonition type="info">

If you are using [Prisma Middleware](/concepts/components/prisma-client/middleware) in your application, make sure they are added before any Prisma Client extensions (like Accelerate). For example:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$use(middleware).$extends(withAccelerate())
```

### 2.5. Use Accelerate in your database queries

The `withAccelerate` extension primarily does two things:

- Gives you access to the `cacheStrategy` field within each applicable model method that allows you to define a cache strategy per-query.
- Routes all of your queries through a connection pooler.

#### No cache strategy to only use connection pool

If you simply want to take advantage of Accelerate's connection pooling feature without applying a cache strategy, you may run your query the same way you would have without Accelerate.

By enabling Accelerate and supplying the Accelerate connection string, your queries now use the connection pooler by default.

#### Define a cache strategy

Update a query with the new `cacheStrategy` property which allows you to define a cache strategy for that specific query:

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: 'alice@prisma.io',
    },
  },
  cacheStrategy: { swr: 60, ttl: 60 },
})
```

In the example above, `swr: 60` and `ttl: 60` means Accelerate will serve cached data for 60 seconds and then another 60 seconds while Accelerate fetches fresh data in the background.

You should now see improved performance for your cached queries.
