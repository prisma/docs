## Prerequisites

To be able to participate in Accelerate’s Early Access program, you need the following prerequisites:

- A GitHub account
- A project that uses [Prisma Client](/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client) `4.10.0` or higher.
- A hosted PostgreSQL, MySQL, PlanetScale, CockroachDB, or MongoDB database
- An invite to Accelerate’s Early Access program

<Admonition type="info">

During early access, we can allow only a certain number of participants to join. To get access to Accelerate please join the [waitlist](https://prisma-data.typeform.com/to/WwPDKEQ5?typeform-source=prisma103696.typeform.com).

## Enable Accelerate in a Cloud Project

Follow the steps described [here](/data-platform/cloud-projects/platform/projects#configure-accelerate) to configure Accelerate in a Cloud Project.

<Admonition type="info">

You need a Prisma Cloud Project to use Accelerate.

</Admonition>

## Use Accelerate in your application

To get started using Accelerate, ensure you’re using Prisma Client `4.10.0` or higher.

### Update your database connection string

After enabling Accelerate in your Cloud Project and creating a new API key, you should be given an Accelerate connection string.

Update your database connection string in your `.env` file to use that Accelerate connection string:

```shell
# .env
# __API_KEY__ is a unique API key that Accelerate generates and automatically assigns to a project.
DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=__API_KEY__"

# Previous connection string
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/db_name?schema=public"
```

### Install the Accelerate Prisma Client extension

Run the following command to install the Accelerate extension for Prisma Client:

```shell
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

If your Prisma version is below `4.16.0`, enable the Prisma Client extension feature:

```prisma
/// prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

### Generate Prisma Client for Data Proxy

Run the following command to generate Prisma Client for the Prisma's data proxy:

```shell
npx prisma generate --accelerate
```

<Admonition type="warning">

If your Prisma version is below `5.0.0`, generate Prisma Client with the `--data-proxy` option:

```shell
npx prisma generate --data-proxy
```

</Admonition>

### Extend your Prisma Client instance to add the Accelerate extension

To use Accelerate, you must extend Prisma Client with the Accelerate extension.
Extend your Prisma Client instance to add the Accelerate extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prismaWithAccelerate = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
```

If VS Code does not recognize the `$extends` method, refer to [this section](/data-platform/accelerate/faq#vs-code-does-not-recognize-the-extends-method) on how to resolve the issue.

<Admonition type="info">

If you are using [Prisma Middleware](/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/middleware) in your application, make sure they are added before any Prisma Client extensions (like Accelerate). For example:

```ts
const prismaWithAccelerate = new PrismaClient()
  .$use(middleware)
  .$extends(withAccelerate())
```

</Admonition>

### Define your first cache strategy

Update a query with the new `cacheStrategy` property which allows you to define a cache strategy for that specific query:

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: 'alice@prisma.io',
    },
  },
  cacheStrategy: { swr: 60, ttl: 60 },
})
```

In the example above, `swr: 60` and `ttl: 60` means Accelerate will serve cached data for 60 seconds and then another 60 seconds while Accelerate fetches fresh data in the background.

You should now see improved performance for your cached queries.

For information about which strategy best serves your application, see [Select a cache strategy](https://www.notion.so/36960c5683cd4ff598b4fb64f7b5a64c#565c30792ea5487683961a6b27780a59).
