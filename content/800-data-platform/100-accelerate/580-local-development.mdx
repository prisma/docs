Prisma Accelerate is designed to efficiently scale database connections in a production environment while providing a global cache. To leverage the benefits of connection pooling and a global cache, it is essential to utilize a publicly accessible database.

In development environments, using a publicly available database may not be possible, and you may want to use a local database. Here, we will explain how to use Prisma Accelerate client extension in a development environment with a local database.

## Prisma Accelerate with a local database

To benefit from Accelerate's connection pool and global cache features, you must have a publicly accessible database, enabling the creation of a Prisma Accelerate URL. It's important to note that Accelerate's features won't function with a local database.

However, using a local database URL, you can add the Accelerate client extension to your Prisma Client. This will allow you to use a local database in your development environment. Keep in mind that, in this scenario, caching and connection pooling won't be available.

In a production environment, when a generated Accelerate connection string is used, you will be able to use connection pooling and caching by adding the Accelerate client extension to the `PrismaClient`.

Here is how to use a local PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM and Prisma Accelerate client extension (without caching and connection pooling):

1. Paste your local database URL in your .env file

   ```.env
   DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@127.0.0.1:5432/localdb"
   ```

2. Generate a Prisma Client

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

   > Note: The `--no-engine` cannot be used when working with a local database, as it generates an engineless Prisma Client which requires the use of an Accelerate connection string.

3. Add Prisma Accelerate to your project

   ```typescript
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
   import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

   const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
   ```

   > `PrismaClient` infers that a local database is being used from the database connection string and disables the connection pooling and caching functionalities of Prisma Accelerate.

## Using Prisma Accelerate in edge functions in a development environment

When working with Prisma Accelerate in a dev environment for [Next.js edge functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions), you must use a `PrismaClient` without an engine.

To create this engineless PrismaClient, run the command `prisma generate --no-engine`. Now, you will be able to use `PrismaClient` for the edge.

```bash
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client/edge";
```

You must use the Accelerate connection string to use `PrismaClient` for the edge with Accelerate.
