Prisma Accelerate is designed to efficiently scale database connections in a production environment while providing a global cache. To leverage the benefits of connection pooling and a global cache, it is essential to utilize a publicly accessible database.

In development environments, you may want to use a local database to minimize expenses. Furthermore, you may consider extending `PrismaClient` with the Accelerate client extension once, so that you can use a local database in development and a hosted database with Accelerate’s connection pooling and caching enabled. This eliminates the need for conditional logic to switch clients between development and production.

Here, we will explain how to use Prisma Accelerate client extension in a development environment with a local database.

## Using Prisma Accelerate client extension in development and production

Accelerate doesn’t work with a local database. However, using a local database URL, you can add the Accelerate client extension to your Prisma Client. This will allow you to use a local database in your development environment. Keep in mind that, in this scenario, caching and connection pooling won't be available.

Here is how to use a local PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM and Prisma Accelerate client extension (without caching and connection pooling):

1. Paste your local database URL in your .env file

   ```.env
   DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@127.0.0.1:5432/localdb"
   ```

2. Generate a Prisma Client

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

   > Note: The `--no-engine` cannot be used when working with a local database, as it generates an engineless Prisma Client which requires the use of an Accelerate connection string.

3. Add Prisma Accelerate to your project

   ```typescript
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
   import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

   const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
   ```

   > `PrismaClient` with the Accelerate client extension uses the local database connection. Accelerate won’t work as a local database is being used.

In a production environment, when a generated Accelerate connection string is used, you will be able to use connection pooling and caching by adding the Accelerate client extension to the `PrismaClient`.

## Locally using Prisma Accelerate in edge functions

When working with Prisma Accelerate in a dev environment for [Next.js edge functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions), you must use `PrismaClient` that can be used in edge functions.

```bash
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client/edge";
```

The `PrismaClient` in Next.js edge functions does not support a direct database connection, hence you have to use the Accelerate connection string.
