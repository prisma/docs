## **Problem**

The contents of the Prisma schema file does not seem to update in **Schema Viewer** of your project after you make a change to the file and push that to GitHub.

## **Solution**

Make sure that you open **Schema Viewer** both for the correct project and environment.

If you have multiple environments on a single project, you might be looking at an environment that is based on another branch or repository in GitHub.
