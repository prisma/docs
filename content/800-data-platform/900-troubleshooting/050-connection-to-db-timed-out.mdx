## **Problem**

The error _Connection your database timed out_ appears when you use the **Data Browser** or the **Query Console**.

## **Cause**

When using the **Data Browser** or the **Query Console**, the default timeout for requests sent to the database is `15ms`. If a response is not avaialble within this limit, the error appears.

Several reasons related to the Data Proxy or database configuration might cause this issue.

### **Causes related to Data Proxy**

* The time added to a request because it is routed through the Data Proxy pushed the timeout beyond the limit
* The database and Data Proxy are in different geolocations

### **Causes related to the response size, database, and network latency**

* The time it took the database to process the query pushed it over the timeout limit
* The payload response is large and could not be processed within the timeout limit
* The depth of the query is large (it includes mutliple relational fields)

## **Solution**

While you can do little to impact potential Data Proxy or network latency, you can start with one of the following solutions.

* Retry your operation in the **Data Browser** or query in the **Query Console** and see if it completes successfully.
* Configure your Data Proxy to be closer to or in the same location as the database.

    **Note**<br /><br />
    You can do so only by creating a new environment in which you can specify a different Data Proxy location.
