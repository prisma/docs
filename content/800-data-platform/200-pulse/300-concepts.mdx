## Change data capture

[Change data capture (CDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) is a technique used to track and capture changes in a database enabling real-time updates. It allows applications to be informed about the modifications in the database, ensuring data consistency between multiple applications.

## Logical replication

Logical replication is a method of replicating data objects and their changes based on their replication identity (usually a primary key). You can read more about logical replication and how it pertains to your database in Postgres' documentation [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).
