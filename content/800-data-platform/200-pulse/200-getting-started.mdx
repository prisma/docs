## Prerequisites

To participate in Pulse's Early Access program, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- A GitHub account.
- A project that uses [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client) `4.14.0` or higher.
- A publicly accessible PostgreSQL database.
- Ability to use the superuser account of the database instance. In the future, we will support the ability to connect to your database from Pulse with a limited access, non-superuser account.
- An invitation to [Pulse's Early Access program](https://prisma-data.typeform.com/to/K3fQej6J).

You will also need a database with the following configurations:

- Postgres version 12+.
- Ensure your database is publicly accessible.
- Enable [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-quick-setup.html) on your database.
- A database superuser that can be used for connections inside Pulse.

## 1. Enable Pulse in a Cloud Project

Follow the steps described [here](/data-platform/cloud-projects/platform/projects#configure-pulse) to configure Pulse in a Cloud Project.

## 2. Use Pulse in an application

<Admonition type="info">

We have created an [example repository](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter) on GitHub to help you get started using Pulse. If you would like to start there, you can do so.

</Admonition>

The following will show how you can utilize Pulse in an existing application. We will be adding Pulse to the [hello-prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql) example from our documentation.

### 2.1. Install the Pulse Prisma Client extension

In a project using [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client), run the following command to install the Pulse extension:

```shell
npm install @prisma/extension-pulse
```

### Store your Cloud Projects API key in your .env file

The Pulse extension requires you to use a Cloud Projects API key.

<Admonition type="info">

You should have received an API key from the Cloud Projects dashboard when setting up your project.

</Admonition>

In `.env`, add a variable named `PULSE_API_KEY`:

```shell
# .env
PULSE_API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY"

# Example:
# PULSE_API_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcGlfa2V5IjoiNGMxNzM0MGItMmFhYy00MGMxLWE1ZDctNzYyNmRjNjg3NjM4IiwidGVuYW50X2lkIjoiY2VhZjE0NThkZGUyYzJmNTU0ZmNkNTI2MmFmOWY1ODljMWJiZmRhNDU0N2UxMjM1ODk3MGQ2MGI1ZjRlNTU0OCIsImludGVybmFsX3NlY3JldCI6ImM1ZTcxYjJhLTE0NzdawdwDliZS1hM2IzLTczODFkNDM5ZmEwZSJ9.wCUlghC_suFBr2vnk0q_5I8iRNRDyEQo0W9rnhf6mCw"
```

### 2.2. Create a Pulse-enabled Prisma Client

To use Pulse, you must extend Prisma Client with the Pulse extension.
Add the following to extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Pulse extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({ apiKey: process.env.PULSE_API_KEY })
)
```

### 2.3. Create your first Pulse subscription

With the Pulse extension applied, you may now use Pulse's `subscribe()` method on any model defined in your Prisma Schema to subscribe to data change events.

In the example below, a subscription is made on a `user` table that listens for _any_ change event on that table:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withPulse({ apiKey: apiKey }))

async function main() {
  const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({})

  if (subscription instanceof Error) {
    throw subscription
  }

  for await (const event of subscription) {
    console.log('just received an event:', event)
  }
}

main()
```

Refer to the [API Reference](/data-platform/pulse/api-reference) section for more detail on the filtering options available to the `subscribe()` method.
