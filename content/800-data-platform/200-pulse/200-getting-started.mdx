## Prerequisites

To participate in Pulse's Early Access program, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- A GitHub account.
- A project that uses [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client) `4.14.0` or higher.
- A publicly accessible PostgreSQL database.
- Ability to use the superuser account of the database instance. In the future, we will support the ability to connect to your database from Pulse with a limited access, non-superuser account.
- An invitation to Pulse's Early Access program.

## Set up a database

You will need a database with the following configurations:

- Postgres version 12+
- Ensure your database is publicly accessible
- Enable [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-quick-setup.html) on your database
- A database superuser that can be used for connections inside Pulse

If you have a database that meets these requirements, you can proceed. If you are having issues setting up Pulse with your database and we do not have a guide to help with your setup, please join the Prisma community Slack and post your issues in the [#pulse-feedback](https://prisma.slack.com/archives/C058GKE3C1E) channel.

## Enable Pulse in a Cloud Project

Follow the steps described [here](/data-platform/cloud-projects/platform/projects#configure-pulse) to configure Pulse in a Cloud Project.

<Admonition type="info">

You need a Prisma Cloud Project to use Pulse.

</Admonition>

## Use Pulse in an application

<Admonition type="info">

We have created an [example repository](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter) on GitHub to help you get started using Pulse. If you would like to start there, you can do so.

</Admonition>

The following will show how you can utilize Pulse in an existing application. We will be adding Pulse to the hello-prisma example from our documentation. If you don't have an application started, please follow [this guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql) and return here afterwards.

### Install the Pulse Prisma Client extension

In a project using [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client), run the following command to install the Pulse extension:

```shell
npm install @prisma/extension-pulse
```

<!-- ### Store your Cloud Projects API key in your .env file

The Pulse extension requires you to use a Cloud Projects API key.

<Admonition type="info">

You should have received an API key from the Cloud Projects dashboard when setting up your project.

</Admonition>

In `.env`, add a variable named `PULSE_API_KEY`:

```shell
# .env
PULSE_API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY"

# Example:
# PULSE_API_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcGlfa2V5IjoiNGMxNzM0MGItMmFhYy00MGMxLWE1ZDctNzYyNmRjNjg3NjM4IiwidGVuYW50X2lkIjoiY2VhZjE0NThkZGUyYzJmNTU0ZmNkNTI2MmFmOWY1ODljMWJiZmRhNDU0N2UxMjM1ODk3MGQ2MGI1ZjRlNTU0OCIsImludGVybmFsX3NlY3JldCI6ImM1ZTcxYjJhLTE0NzdawdwDliZS1hM2IzLTczODFkNDM5ZmEwZSJ9.wCUlghC_suFBr2vnk0q_5I8iRNRDyEQo0W9rnhf6mCw"
``` -->

### Create a Pulse-enabled Prisma Client

To use Pulse, you must extend Prisma Client with the Pulse extension.
Add the following to extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Pulse extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withPulse({ apiKey: apiKey }))
```

<Admonition type="warning">
  We recommend storing your Cloud Projects API key in an environment variable.
</Admonition>

### Create your first Pulse subscription

With the Pulse extension applied, you may now use Pulse's `subscribe()` method on any model defined in your Prisma Schema to subscribe to data change events.

In the example below, a subscription is made on a `user` table that listens for _any_ change event on that table:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withPulse({ apiKey: apiKey }))

async function main() {
  const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({})

  if (subscription instanceof Error) {
    throw subscription
  }

  for await (const event of subscription) {
    console.log('just received an event:', event)
  }
}

main()
```

<Admonition type="info">

Refer to the [API Reference](/data-platform/pulse/api-reference) section for more detail on the filtering options available to the `subscribe()` method.
