If you no longer need a project in the Prisma Data Platform, you can delete it from the project settings.

</TopBlock>

## Prerequisites and considerations

- You must be the [owner](/data-platform/members/user-roles) of the project.
- You can delete any project that is on the [Free plan](/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas#strongfreestrong-plan).
- To delete a project on the [Scale plan](/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas#strongscalestrong-plan), you must first [downgrade it to the Free plan](/data-platform/billing/manage-plans#downgrade-to-free-plan).

## Steps

1. In the upper left, click your project name and select **Project settings**.
