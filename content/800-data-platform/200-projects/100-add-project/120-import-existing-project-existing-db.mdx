</TopBlock>

## Prerequisites and considerations

* GitHub account
* GitHub repository with your Node.js application that uses Prisma ORM
* Connection string to a [Prisma ORM-supported database](/reference/database-reference/supported-databases)
* [Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform](/data-platform/accounts#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform)
* [Grant the Prisma GitHub app read and write permissions to your GitHub repositories](/data-platform/projects/add-project#grant-read-and-write-permissions-to-the-prisma-github-app)

## Steps

1. Go to the [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page and click **New Project**.
2. On the _Configure project_ page, name your project and select an existing GitHub repository.
    1. In **Display Name**, enter a name for your project.

        **Note**<br /><br />
        The display name of a project appears in several places in the Prisma Data Platform.<br />
          &nbsp;• [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page<br />
          &nbsp;• [_Billing_](https://cloud.prisma.io/billing) page<br />
          &nbsp;• **Projects** drop-down in the upper left

    2. From **GitHub Accounts & Organizations**, select a GitHub account or an organization.
    3. Select **Import a Prisma repository**.
    4. From **Repository**, select the GitHub repository you want to import.
    5. From **Branch**, select the branch you want to import.
    6. In **Prisma Schema path**, check that the import wizard detects the path of the `schema.prisma` file correctly.
    7. Click **Next**.

3. On the _Configure environment_ page, connect your database and configure the Data Proxy location.
    1. In the **Connection string** text box, paste your database connection string.
    2. Under _Data Proxy_, from the **Location** drop-down menu, select the geographic location for the Data Proxy.
        <Admonition>
        
        **Note**<br /><br />
        Select a Data Proxy location that is close to the geographic location of your database.<br /><br />
        If you select a Data Proxy location that is remote from your database, then when your application sends requests to your database through the Data Proxy, the responses might be slow or time out due to higher latency.
        </Admonition>
    3. From **Static IPs**, select **Enabled** if your database is behind a firewall and you can only configure external access from specific IP addresses. Copy the IP addresses and add them to the allowlist of your database.
        <Admonition>

        **Note**<br /><br />
        For more information, see [Static egress IP address](/data-platform/static-ips). 
        </Admonition>
    4. Click **Create Project**.

        />

4. On the _Deploy project_ page, you can deploy your project to Vercel, and save your connection strings and environment variables.
5. Click **Done**.
