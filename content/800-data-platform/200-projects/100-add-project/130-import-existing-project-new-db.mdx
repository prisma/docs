## What's next

If you have existing migrations, you can use `prisma migrate deploy` to [manually deploy your Prisma schema to the new database](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/migrate-development-production#production-and-testing-environments).

Alternatively, you can [create new database migrations with `prisma migrate dev`](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/get-started) and continue exploring the Prisma Data Platform.
