In the Prisma Data Platform, you can add projects when you create a new one from one of the provided application templates, or when you import your existing JavaScript/TypeScript applications that use Prisma ORM. When you import a project, you can choose to test your application and schema with a new database, or you can import with your existing production database.

Before you start, complete the prerequisite steps to prepare your account and give Prisma Data Platform the needed permissions to create and read GitHub repositories for your projects.

## Prerequisites and considerations

- [Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform](/data-platform/account#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform).
- [Grant read and write permissions to GitHub repositories](/data-platform/projects/add-project#grant-read-and-write-permissions-to-the-prisma-github-app).

### Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform

You need a Prisma Data Platform account to create projects. For more information see [Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform](/data-platform/account#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform).

### Grant read and write permissions to the Prisma GitHub app

When you sign up for the Prisma Data Platform, you must grant access to the Prisma GitHub app to read data about your GitHub profile and use that to log you in to the platform.

In addition, you must also grant read and write permissions to the GitHub app so that it can read and create new repositories.

#### Steps

1. After you [sign up for the Prisma Data Platform](/data-platform/account#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform), go to the [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Click **GitHub Accounts & Organizations**.
4. If you do not see any GitHub accounts or organizations in the drop-down, select **+ Add an Organization or Account**.

   />

5. On the new browser tab that opens, click **Install** to give Prisma read and write permissions to your repositories.

#### Result

Prisma now has the permissions that it needs to read your Prisma schemas and create new repositories for your Prisma Data Platform projects.

You can confirm that the Prisma GitHub app is installed by viewing your GitHub profile and then select **Applications** > **Integrations**.

## Workflows to add projects

You can [add projects](/data-platform/projects/add-project) with one of the following workflows to create new or import existing projects:

1. [Create a new database application from a template](/data-platform/projects/add-project/create-new-project-from-template)
   - **Database**: provide a connection string to an empty database
   - **GitHub repository**: create a new GitHub repository
   - **Use case**: Explore project creation and start with a template Prisma schema which is immediately migrated to the empty database.
2. [Import an existing application with an existing database](/data-platform/projects/add-project/import-existing-project-existing-db)
   - **Database**: provide a connection string to an existing database
   - **GitHub repository**: select an existing GitHub repository
   - **Use case**: Import your production application and configure the Data Proxy to enable connection pooling and prevent exhausted database connections in serverless environments.
3. [Import an existing application with a new database](/data-platform/projects/add-project/import-existing-project-new-db)
   - **Database**: provide a connection string to an empty database
   - **GitHub repository**: select an existing GitHub repository
   - **Use case**: Import your application and use an empty database to explore and test project creation and the features in the Prisma Data Platform.
