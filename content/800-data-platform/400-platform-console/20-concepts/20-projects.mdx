Projects embody your applications integrated with our products. Each project is associated with a Workspace and can be configured independently from one another.

## API Keys

A project API key is required to authenticate requests from your Prisma Client to products such as Accelerate and Pulse. You may generate multiple API keys per project and manage those via the **Settings** tab of a project's page.

### View API keys

Within a project's **Settings** tab, you can find your existing project API keys under the **Project API keys** tab.

You can also get to this section from the project page's **Dashboard** view by hitting the **Manage API keys** link if your project has any associated API keys.

### Create an API key

Project API keys can be created within the **Settings** section of a project's details page under the **Project API keys** tab.

Once on this tab, click the **New API Key** button.

You will be prompted for a name for the new API key. After filling in that field, click **Create API Key**.

The generated API key is only accessible when it is first created, so be sure to copy it and store it in a safe place before closing the popup or clicking **I've stored it securely**.

### Use an API key

A project API key must be provided to validate requests through products such as Accelerate and Pulse. With an API key in place, Prisma will be able to validate requests and associate usage with the project the project API key belongs to.

Below are examples of how to use a project API key with each product:

#### Accelerate

Accelerate requires your project API key to be passed via the `prisma://` connection string as a URL parameter.

To apply your project API key to an Accelerate connection string, add the `api_key` parameter with the API key as the value:

```env file=.env
ACCELERATE_URL=prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=__API_KEY__
```

For more information about setting up and using Accelerate, see the [Accelerate documentation](/data-platform/accelerate/getting-started).

</Admonition>

#### Pulse

Pulse requires the project API key to be passed when extending Prisma Client with the `withPulse` client extension.

To apply your project API key, create an environment variable that holds your API key:

```env file=.env
PRISMA_API_KEY=__API_KEY__
```

Then use that environment variable when initializing the `withPulse` extension by providing it as the value of the argument object's `apiKey` field:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({
    apiKey: process.env.PRISMA_API_KEY,
  })
)
```

For more information about setting up and using Pulse, see the [Pulse documentation](/data-platform/pulse/getting-started).

### Delete an API key

To delete an API key, head into the **Settings** tab of your project and select the **Project API keys** tab on that page.

The table here displays all of your API keys associated with the selected project. This table's **Action** column contains a trash can symbol for each record. Clicking this symbol on any record will open a popup asking if you are sure you want to delete the project API key.

Click **Remove API key** to remove the key.

<Admonition type="warning">

Deleting an API key is irreversible. Any applications using that API key will need to be updated to a valid key to continue functioning as expected.
