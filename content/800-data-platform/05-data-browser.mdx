Use the **Data Browser** in the Prisma Data Platform to view and edit your application data.

</TopBlock>

## Models (tables or collections)

When you first open the **Data Browser**, you see a list of all models defined in your Prisma schema file.

<Admonition>

**What is a model?**<br /><br />

The term **model** refers to the data model definitions that you add to the Prisma schema file. Depending on the database that you use, a model definition, such as `model User`, refers to a **table** in a relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, CockroachDB) or a **collection** in MongoDB.<br /><br />
For more information, see [Defining models](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-models).
</Admonition>

You can select a model and its data opens in a new tab.

### Open and close models

To open another model, click the **+** button.

To close a model, click the the **x** button in the model tab.

### Filter data

Use the **Filters** menu to filter data in the model by adding conditions.

**Steps**

1. Click **Filters** and select **Add a new filter**.
2. Configure the filter.
   1. Select the field by which you want to filter.
   2. Select a comparison operator.
      - **equals**
      - **in**
      - **notin**
      - **lt**
      - **lte**
      - **gt**
      - **gte**
      - **not**
   3. Type the value you want to use for the filter.<br />
      **Step result**: The model is filtered immediately after you define the first filter.
3. To add a new filter, click **Add a new filter** and repeat the steps above.
4. To remove a filter, click the **x** button on the right.

**Result**

* The data in the model is filtered based on the conditions you added.
* The default **None** value in the **Filters** menu changes to the number of filters you added.

### Show and hide fields

You can select which fields to view or hide by using the **Fields** menu.

<Admonition>

**What is a field?**<br /><br />

A **field** is a property of a model which you add in the data model definitions in the Prisma schema file. Depending on the database that you use, a field , such as the `title` field in `model User { title String }`, refers to a **column** in a relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, CockroachDB) or a **document field** in MongoDB.<br /><br />
For more information, see [Defining fields](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-fields).
</Admonition>

**Steps**

1. Click the **Fields** menu.
2. Select only the fields you want to see and deselect any fields you want to hide.

**Result**

The model is immediately filtered to exclude the data from any fields you have deselected.

Also, the **Fields** menu shows the number of fields that are currently selected.

### Show and hide records

You can also select to show or skip a specific number of records in the model view.

<Admonition>

**What is a record?**<br /><br />

A **record** refers to a **row of data in a table** in a relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, CockroachDB) or a **document** in MongoDB.
</Admonition>

**Steps**

1. Click the **Showing** menu.
2. In the **Take** box, specify the maximum number of records that you want the model view to show.
3. In the **Skip** box, specify how many of the first records you want to hide.

**Result**

The model is immediately filtered to show or hide records based on your selection.

The **Showing** menu indicates how many records are shown out of how many available records are in the model.

## Editing data

In the model view, you can edit data directly in the model cells. You can add new records as well as delete existing records.

You must confirm every edit operation (add, edit, or delete). You confirm added and edited records with the **Save change** button. When you select records and click **Delete records**, you confirm the deletion in a dialog box.

You can accumulate multiple added records and edited cells, which you can then finalize with the **Save changes** button. 

In contrast, you cannot accumulate the deletion of records. Instead, you can select multiple records and delete them at once with the **Delete records** button. This also means that when you delete records, the operation completes immediately (after you confirm it).

In addition, if you have any accumulated added or edited records and then decide to delete records, the deletion also force-saves the accumulated edits.

You can discard any accumulated changes with the **Discard changes** button.

### Add a record

1. In the model view, click **Add record**.
2. Based on the data allowed in each field, type the data for the record.

   | Field data type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
