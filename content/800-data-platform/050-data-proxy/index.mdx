Serverless functions are ephemeral and short-lived, so their database connections are numerous and brief.

Because of this, using traditional databases in serverless environments often leads to the exhaustion of the maximum number of concurrent database connections and increased latencies when each request needs to establish a database connection.

Data Proxy in the Prisma Data Platform provides database connection management and pooling, load balancing, scaling, and fault tolerance so that you can manage and scale database connections for applications that run with Prisma ORM in serverless environments. With Data Proxy, your application can scale and maintain predictable database performance as it also limits the total number of database connections.

Designed specifically with serverless functions in mind, Data Proxy provides a wide range of benefits for applications that run in serverless and edge environments.

## Architecture

Prisma develops and maintains the Data Proxy infrastructure and services to provide connection pooling, load balancing, scaling, and fault tolerance for database applications that run in serverless and edge environments.

Data Proxy infrastructure is currently available in two regions:

* US East 1 (West Virginia, United States)
* EU Central 1 (Frankfurt, Germany)

In each region, the Data Proxy infrastructure has multiple clusters that enable the load balancing, high availability, and failover of database connection pooling and management.

You can use Data Proxy with [all databases that Prisma ORM supports](/reference/database-reference/supported-databases).

## Connection pooling and connection management

Data Proxy provides connection pooling so that your application can reuse active connections and never exhaust the maximum number of connections that your database allows.

Connection pooling with the Data Proxy utilizes orchestrated Prisma [query engine](/concepts/components/prisma-engines/query-engine) technology to open, maintain, and close connection pools and, thus, help applications load-balance and scale database requests based on demand.

A Data Proxy connection pool maintains active database connections and ensures that an application reuses those when new requests come in.

In each region, Data Proxy management services orchestrate the lifecycle of connection pools. The lifecycle of a Data Proxy connection pool goes through the following stages:

* the assignment of connection pools from each available cluster in the region
* the increase of connection pools when the workload of your application increases
* the maintenance of idle connection pools
* the decrease and stop of connection pools after six minutes of inactivity within a pool

This orchestration ensures that you accumulate Data Proxy usage (in CPU milliseconds) only when your database processes queries.

The orchestration of Data Proxy connection pools ensures high availability, load balancing, and scalability of your application.

* **High availability**. In each region, the Data Proxy infrastructure runs multiple clusters. By default and until your application reaches higher workloads, from each cluster the Data Proxy starts and assigns a connection pool to an application. If a cluster goes through a period of downtime, the remaining ones take over the management of connection pools.

    **Note**<br /><br />

    You can select only one of the available regions for an environment of your application in the Prisma Data Platform.

    Because of this, the high availability of Data Proxy infrastructure applies within a single region. Data Proxy connection pools from other regions cannot take over an application's connection pool from the current region.

    </Admonition>
* **Load balancing**. In each region, the number of incoming requests for an application is distributed between multiple connection pools running from the different clusters available in the region.
* **Scalability**. Data Proxy creates new connection pools during periods of higher activity and closes connection pools when they are no longer necessary. This orchestration provides the flexibility to scale your database application and allows for reduced costs at times of lower activity.

## Reduced bundle size

When you generate Prisma Client to work with Data Proxy, the query engine logic to connect and maintain connection pools is delegated to Data Proxy. As a result, you have a reduced bundle size for your application which helps to speed up load times and enable faster performance.

For more information see, [Bundle size](/data-platform/data-proxy/bundle-size).

## Cold starts prevention

Data Proxy prevents unnecessary serverless cold starts as it keeps the existing database connections live and reuses them for new requests. This prevents the cold start of new containers whenever serverless functions are invoked after the first cold start.
