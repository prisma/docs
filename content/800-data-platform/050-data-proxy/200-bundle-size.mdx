When you use the [Prisma Client with the Data Proxy](/data-platform/data-proxy/use-data-proxy#), the logic of how to connect, query, manage database connections and connection pools resides in the Data Proxy and is no longer bundled with the Prisma Client. This leads to a reduced size of the Prisma Client and faster deployment and load times for your applications that use Prisma.

## Prisma Client variants and bundle sizes

By default, the Prisma Client bundles the query engine which includes the connection logic for all databases that Prisma supports. With the Data Proxy, you offload the query engine logic to connect to your database and manage connection pooling to the Data Proxy, and you also achieve a much smaller bundle size for your application.
