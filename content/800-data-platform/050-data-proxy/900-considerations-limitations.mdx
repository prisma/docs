## Considerations

### Connect to databases hosted with a provider different from AWS

You can connect to a database hosted on any provider that is accessible from a public internet address. For best results and response times, configure Data Proxy in a region that is the same or as close as possible to the database.

We plan to expand the number of providers and regions. If we don't yet support a region or provider, you can [submit a request](https://pris.ly/proxy-new-region). This helps us to prioritize providers and regions.

### Recommended concurrent connections

We recommend that you use a database that supports at least 20 concurrent connections. You will probably not need to set a concurrency limit on AWS Lambda. If necessary, requests are queued until they can be processed.

For more information about configuring a maximum number of connections to the database, see [Manage the number of database connections](/data-platform/data-proxy/use-data-proxy#manage-the-number-of-database-connections).

### Idle connections to the database

Data Proxy keeps several connection pools running to maintain open database connections even when no queries run from your application. The connection pools and any remaining idle connections close after six minutes of inactivity (or when no incoming queries are sent the database).

The number of idle connections to the database depends on the number of running connection pools at any point in time. 
In each of the supported locations, the Data Proxy architecture includes multiple clusters that maintain idle connections to the database.

## Limitations

### Prisma Migrate and Introspection do not work with a Data Proxy connection string

You cannot use specific Prisma CLI commands, such as `prisma migrate` and `prisma db pull` with a Data Proxy connection string.

You can work around this issue when you [specify a direct database connection string for each Prisma CLI command](/data-platform/data-proxy/prisma-cli-with-data-proxy) that you need.

### Data Proxy concurrency limits

Depending on your [project plan](/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas), the Prisma Data Proxy provides a different [limit of concurrent proxy instances](/data-platform/about/limits-and-status#concurrency-limits-of-the-data-proxy).

The performance of a single proxy instance depends on a large number of variables:

- the type of queries
- latencies and deployment locations
- the performance of your database
- ...

If you are seeing `429` HTTP errors in your logs, this probably means that you are hitting the concurrency limits.

[Contact Support](/data-platform/contact-support) if you are hitting the concurrency limits and have trouble scaling your Prisma application.

### Unsupported Prisma Client features

#### Metrics and Tracing preview features not supported
Data Proxy does not yet support the following Prisma Client preview features:

- [Metrics](/concepts/components/prisma-client/metrics)
- [OpenTelemetry tracing](/concepts/components/prisma-client/opentelemetry-tracing)

To use Data Proxy in such cases, you must first remove `metrics` and `tracing` from the `previewFeatures` section of your `schema.prisma` file.

For example:

```diff
   generator client {
     provider        = "prisma-client-js"
-     previewFeatures = ["metrics", "tracing"]
+     previewFeatures = []
   }
```

If you have one or more of the listed preview features enabled and you run `prisma generate --data-proxy`, the command shows an error.

#### <inlinecode>$connect</inlinecode> and <inlinecode>$disconnect</inlinecode> not supported

While still available with the Data Proxy, the `PrismaClient` method `$connect` does not create a new connection pool and the `$disconnect` method does not close the connection pool.

Both methods are valid code in Prisma Client with the Data Proxy, but they do not have any impact on the connections to the database. This is because the Data Proxy manages the connections.

You can keep `$connect` and `$disconnect` as they are. Your application will continue to run as expected.
