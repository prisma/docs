## Deploy to Vercel Serverless Functions

You only need minimal changes to an existing project using Prisma Client with [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions#serverless-functions) to start using the Data Proxy.

Our Vercel Deployment sample repository has a [special branch](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-vercel/tree/data-proxy) showing how to deploy a Prisma application to Vercel Serverless Functions using the Data Proxy. [Use this link to create a Vercel project based on this branch](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fprisma%2Fdeployment-example-vercel%2Ftree%2Fdata-proxy&env=DATABASE_URL,MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL,PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY&envDescription=DATABASE_URL%20-%20Data%20Proxy%20URL%2C%20MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL%20-%20direct%20connection%20string%2C%20PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY%20-%20always%20set%20to%20true%20so%20Vercel%20generates%20a%20Data%20Proxy%20Client&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prisma.io%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdata-platform%2Fdata-proxy%23using-the-data-proxy-in-a-prisma-application). It makes sure you set the correct environment variables for getting a Prisma Client for Data Proxy and running migrations when Data Proxy is configured.

If you want to adapt your project manually:

- Add an environment variable `PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY` to your [Vercel project settings](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) and set its value to `true`.
- If you want to deploy migrations via Vercel, follow our instructions on how to ["Providing the connection string to Prisma Migrate"](#providing-the-connection-string-to-prisma-migrate)
