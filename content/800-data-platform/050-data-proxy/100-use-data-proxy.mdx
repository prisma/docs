To use the Data Proxy for a JavaScript/TypeScript application that uses Prisma, you must first [create a project](/data-platform/projects/create) in Prisma Data Platform. When you create the project, you do the following:

- select a Data Proxy region for the project (make sure that it is close to your database)
- [create a Data Proxy connection string](/data-platform/projects/create#optional-create-a-data-proxy-connection-string)

<Admonition>

**Note**<br /><br />

When you create your project, you do not need to also create a Data Proxy connection string. You can always create a new Data Proxy connection string at a later time as described below in [Enable Data Proxy for a project](#enable-the-data-proxy-for-a-project).

</Admonition>

You can then configure the connection string in your development or deployment environment and [generate Prisma Client for the Data Proxy](#generate-prisma-client-for-the-data-proxy).

</TopBlock>

## Enable the Data Proxy for a project

When you create a project in the platform, the Data Proxy is automatically enabled for your project.

<Admonition>

**Note**<br /><br />

The fact that the Data Proxy is enabled for a project does not yet mean that your application starts to use the proxy.<br /><br />

Your application starts to use the proxy only after you configure a generated Data Proxy connection string as an environment variable for your project so that Prisma Client uses the proxy connection string and not the direct connection to the database.

</Admonition>

### Prerequisites

- [Create a project to add your application in the platform](/data-platform/projects/create). During the process, select a geographic location for the Data Proxy that is closest to the location of your database.
- If your database is behind a firewall, [enable static IP addresses](/data-platform/static-ips) for your project and add the IP addresses for the selected Data Proxy region to the allowlist of your database.
  - US East 1 (West Virginia)
    - 54.204.197.119
    - 3.222.148.224
    - 54.204.47.202
    - 3.227.136.248
  - EU Central 1 (Frankfurt, Germany)
    - 35.157.74.165
    - 18.194.25.248
    - 18.184.112.103
    - 18.157.219.25

### Steps

1. Open your project in the Prisma Data Platform. You can do so from the [**Projects**](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page.
2. Get a Data Proxy connection string for the selected environment.

   1. With the project open and an environment selected, click the **Data Proxy** tab.
   2. Click **Create a connection string**.

      <Admonition type="info">

      **Note**<br /><br />

      You can generate as many Data Proxy connection strings as you need. You can later revoke any of the connection strings that you no longer need.

      </Admonition>

   3. Enter a name for the new Data Proxy connection string and click **Create**.

      <img
        src="../images/data-proxy/create-and-name-new-connection-string.png"
        alt="Prisma Data Platform - Data Proxy - Create and name a new Data Proxy connection string"
        width="450px"
      />

   4. Copy the `prisma://` connection string.

      <Admonition type="warning">

      **Important**<br /><br />

      Save the `prisma://` connection string securely. After you navigate to another page, you cannot retrieve the connection string again from the **Data Proxy**. You can only generate a new connection string, if necessary.

      </Admonition>

        src="../images/data-proxy/copy-connection-string.png"
        alt="Prisma Data Platform - Data Proxy - Copy the Data Proxy connection string"
        width="650px"
      />

## Generate Prisma Client for the Data Proxy

After you create your project in the platform and enable the Data Proxy, you can generate Prisma Client for the Data Proxy and use it with the `prisma://` connection string you obtained.

You can generate and use Prisma Client for the Data Proxy in the following environments:

- In your local development environment, to test the process.
- In your deployment platform. You must replace the direct database connection string with the Data Proxy connection string and make sure that Prisma Client is auto-generated with the `--data-proxy` flag as described below.

### Prerequisites

- [Enable Data Proxy for your project](#enable-the-data-proxy-for-a-project).
- Copy the Data Proxy connection string. Do so for the project environment for which you want to generate Prisma Client.

### Steps

1. In your local development environment, replace the direct database connection string with the Data Proxy `prisma://` connection string.

   ```bash file=.env highlight=1;delete|2;add
   - DATABASE_URL="postgresql://****:****@****"
   + DATABASE_URL="prisma://****:****@****"
   ```

   <Admonition>

   **Note**<br /><br />
   For security reasons, we strongly recommend that you always use environment variables for your database connection strings and Data Proxy strings. Do not hard-code them into your `schema.prisma` file.<br /><br />
   For more information, see [Using `.env` files](/guides/development-environment/environment-variables#using-env-files).

   </Admonition>

1. Install `prisma` and `@prisma/client`.<br /><br />
   Make sure to use version 3.15.2 or later.<br />

   ```terminal
   npm install prisma@latest --save-dev
   npm install @prisma/client@latest --save
   ```

1. Generate Prisma Client with the `--data-proxy` option.

   ```terminal
   npx prisma generate --data-proxy
   ```

   The generated Prisma Client is a lightweight version because it excludes the local [query engine](/concepts/components/prisma-engines/query-engine) files. The Data Proxy handles the query engine logic.

1. Instantiate Prisma Client in your application code.

   - To use the Data Proxy with Node.js, instantiate `@prisma/client`. [Learn more](/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/generating-prisma-client).

       <TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="TypeScript" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="JavaScript" icon="code"/>]}>

       <tab>

     ```ts
     import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
     const prisma = new PrismaClient()
     // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
     ```

       </tab>

       <tab>

     ```js
     const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/clientj')
     const prisma = new PrismaClient()
     // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
     ```

       </tab>

       </TabbedContent>

   - To use the Data Proxy in Edge runtimes, such as Cloudflare Workers or Vercel Edge Functions, instantiate `@prisma/client/edge`.

       <Admonition>

     **Note**<br /><br />

     You can use `@prisma/client/edge` only with the Data Proxy. In such cases, make sure to use the `--data-proxy` flag or the `PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY=true` environment variable when you [generate Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/generating-prisma-client).

       </Admonition>

       <TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="TypeScript" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="JavaScript" icon="code"/>]}>

       <tab>

     ```ts
     import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge'
     const prisma = new PrismaClient()
     // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
     ```

       </tab>

       <tab>

     ```js
     const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client/edge')
     const prisma = new PrismaClient()
     // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
     ```

       </tab>

       </TabbedContent>

### Result

Your application now uses the Data Proxy.

The generated Prisma Client has a reduced bundle size because the entire query engine logic is now hosted with the Data Proxy.

## Manage the number of database connections

You can adjust the maximum number of database connections of each Data Proxy connection pool.

To do so, in the Prisma Data Platform add the `connection_limit` parameter to the database connection string of the environment in your project.

```
postgresql://user:password@host:5432/mydb?connection_limit=60
```
