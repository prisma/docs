Currently, you can only use [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client) with the Data Proxy to _query_ your database.

</TopBlock>


### Problem
If you want to run [migrations](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/get-started), [introspection](/concepts/components/introspection),  or any of the [Prisma CLI commands](/reference/api-reference/command-reference) listed below, you can only do so on a direct (non-Data Proxy) database connection.

**Important**<br /><br />

If your database is behind a firewall, add your local IP address to the allowlist of your database.

</Admonition>

- `prisma db pull`
- `prisma migrate deploy`
- `prisma migrate dev`
- `prisma migrate diff` (some parameters only)
- `prisma migrate reset`
- `prisma migrate resolve`
- `prisma migrate status`
- `prisma db push`
- `prisma db drop`
- `prisma db execute`
- `prisma studio`

### Solution

Assuming that you have `env("DATABASE_URL")` in your `schema.prisma` file, you must override the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable before you run `npx prisma migrate deploy` or any of the commands in the list above.

You can declare the environment variable `MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL`, and use that to override the connection.

For example:

```bash file=.env highlight=2;add
DATABASE_URL="prisma://..."
MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

```

Then, in `package.json` under `scripts`, you can add a new line for each Prisma CLI command you want to use so as to override the Data Proxy connection string.

```js file=package.json highlight=5,6;add
{
  ...,
  "scripts": {
    "generate-client": "prisma generate --data-proxy",
    "migrate-deploy": "DATABASE_URL=\"$MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL\" prisma migrate deploy",
    "dev": "DATABASE_URL=\"$MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL\" prisma migrate dev",
  }
}
```
