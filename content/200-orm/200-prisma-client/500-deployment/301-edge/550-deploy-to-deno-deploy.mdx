<TopBlock>

With this guide, you can learn how to build and deploy a simple application to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). The application uses Prisma ORM to save a log of each request to a [Prisma Postgres](/postgres) database.

This guide covers the use of Prisma CLI with Deno CLI, Deno Deploy, Prisma Client, and Prisma Postgres.

<Admonition type="info">

This guide demonstrates how to deploy an application to Deno Deploy in conjunction with a Prisma Postgres database, but you can also use [your own database with Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate/getting-started#prerequisites).

## Prerequisites

- a free [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/login) account
- a free [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) account
- Node.js & npm installed
- Deno v1.29.4 or later installed. [Learn more](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/#install-deno).
- (Recommended) Latest version of Prisma ORM.
- (Recommended) Deno extension for VS Code. [Learn more](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/vscode/).

## 1. Set up your application and database

To start, you create a directory for your project, and then use `deno run` to initialize your application with `prisma init` as an [npm package with npm specifiers](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/node/).

To set up your application, open your terminal and navigate to a location of your choice. Then, run the following commands to set up your application:

```terminal
mkdir prisma-deno-deploy
cd prisma-deno-deploy
deno run --reload -A npm:prisma@latest init --db
```

Enter a name for your project and choose a database region.

This command:

- Connects your CLI to your [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io) account. If you're not logged in or don't have an account, your browser will open to guide you through creating a new account or signing into your existing one.
- Creates a `prisma` directory containing a `schema.prisma` file for your database models.
- Creates a `.env` file with your `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., for Prisma Postgres it should have something similar to `DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI..."`).

Edit the `prisma/schema.prisma` file to define a `Log` model, add a custom `output` path and enable the `deno` preview feature flag:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3-4,12-23;add showLineNumbers
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  //add-start
  previewFeatures = ["deno"]
  output          = "../generated/client"
  //add-end
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

//add-start
model Log {
  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  level   Level
  message String
  meta    Json
}

enum Level {
  Info
  Warn
  Error
}
//add-end
```

:::note

To use Deno, you need to add the preview feature flag `deno` to the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file. 

Deno also requires you to generate Prisma Client in a custom location. You can enable this with the `output` parameter in the `generator` block. 

:::

Then, install [the Client extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-accelerate) required to use Prisma Postgres:

```terminal
deno install npm:@prisma/extension-accelerate
```

Prisma Client does not read `.env` files by default on Deno, so you must also install `dotenv-cli` locally:

```terminal
deno install npm:dotenv-cli
```

## 2. Create the database schema

With the data model in place and your database connection configured, you can now apply the data model to your database.

```terminal
deno run -A npm:prisma migrate dev --name init
```

The command does two things:

1. It creates a new SQL migration file for this migration
1. It runs the SQL migration file against the database

At this point, the command has an additional side effects. The command installs Prisma Client and creates the `package.json` file for the project.

## 3. Create your application

You can now create a local Deno application. Create `index.ts` in the root folder of your project and add the content below:

```ts file=index.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.140.0/http/server.ts";
import { withAccelerate } from "npm:@prisma/extension-accelerate";
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/client/deno/edge.ts";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

async function handler(request: Request) {
  // Ignore /favicon.ico requests:
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  if (url.pathname === "/favicon.ico") {
    return new Response(null, { status: 204 });
  }

  const log = await prisma.log.create({
    data: {
      level: "Info",
      message: `${request.method} ${request.url}`,
      meta: {
        headers: JSON.stringify(request.headers),
      },
    },
  });
  const body = JSON.stringify(log, null, 2);
  return new Response(body, {
    headers: { "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8" },
  });
}

serve(handler);
```

:::info

**VS Code error: `An import path cannot end with a '.ts' extension`**<br /><br />

If you use VS Code and see the error `An import path cannot end with a '.ts' extension` for the `import` statements at the beginning of `index.ts`, you need to install the [Deno extension for VS Code](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/vscode/), select **View** > **Command Palette** and run the command **Deno: Initialize Workspace Configuration**. This tells VS Code that the TypeScript files in the current project need to run with Deno, which then triggers the correct validations.

:::

## 4. Test your application locally

You can now start your application locally and test the creation of log entries.

```terminal
npx dotenv -- deno run -A ./index.ts
```

In a web browser, open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/). This page writes your request to the database.

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "level": "Info",
  "message": "GET http://localhost:8000/",
  "meta": {
    "headers": "{}"
  }
}
```

Reload the page a few times.<br /><br />Every time you reload, the script generates a new log entry and the `id` of the current log entry increments.

This confirms that your application works when you run it from your local environment.

## 5. Create a repository and push to GitHub

You need a GitHub repository to add your project to Deno Deploy and enable automated deployments whenever you push changes.

To set up a GitHub repository:

1. [Create a private GitHub repository](https://github.com/new).

2. Initialize your repository locally and push your changes to GitHub, with the following commands:

   ```terminal
   git init -b main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/prisma-deno-deploy
   git add .
   git commit -m "initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 6. Deploy to Deno Deploy

Use the GitHub repository to add your application to Deno Deploy:

1. Go to [https://dash.deno.com/](https://dash.deno.com/).
1. Select a GitHub organization or user and then select a repository.
1. Select a production branch and select **Fresh (Automatic)** mode so that Deno Deploy can deploy every time you push a change to the repository.
1. Select `index.ts` as the entry point to your project.
1. Click `Create & Deploy`.

The deployment should fail as you have to add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. 

Locate and navigate to the settings for the project.

1. To define the database connection string, click **Add Variable** in the **Environment Variables** section.
   1. For **KEY**, enter `DATABASE_URL`.
   1. For **VALUE**, paste the database connection string.
1. Click **Save**.<br />
   
You have to add some code and create another commit to trigger a re-dployment.

Add the following code in your `index.ts` file:

```ts file=index.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.140.0/http/server.ts";
import { withAccelerate } from "npm:@prisma/extension-accelerate";
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/client/deno/edge.ts";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

async function handler(request: Request) {
  // Ignore /favicon.ico requests:
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  if (url.pathname === "/favicon.ico") {
    return new Response(null, { status: 204 });
  }

  //add-start
  console.log("Request received.")
  //add-end

  const log = await prisma.log.create({
    data: {
      level: "Info",
      message: `${request.method} ${request.url}`,
      meta: {
        headers: JSON.stringify(request.headers),
      },
    },
  });
  const body = JSON.stringify(log, null, 2);
  return new Response(body, {
    headers: { "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8" },
  });
}

serve(handler);
```

Commit the new changes:

```terminal
git add . 
git commit -m "add log"
git push origin main
```

This rebuilds the deployment, which now works because the environment variable has been added. After it completes, follow the URL in the deployment output. The application should show the same result as before, with a new, incremented log record ID:

```text
{
  "id": 5,
  "level": "Info",
  "message": "GET https://prisma-deno-deploy.deno.dev/",
  "meta": {
    "headers": "{}"
  }
}
```

## Summary

You successfully deployed a Deno application that you created in TypeScript, which uses Prisma Client connecting to a Prisma Postgres database.
