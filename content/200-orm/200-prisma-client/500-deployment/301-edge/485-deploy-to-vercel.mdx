This page covers everything you need to know to deploy an app that uses Prisma Client for talking to a database in [Vercel Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware) or a [Vercel Function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions) deployed to the [Vercel Edge Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/edge-runtime).

To deploy a Vercel Function to the Vercel Edge Runtime, you can set `export const runtime = 'edge'` outside the request handler of the Vercel Function.

## General considerations when deploying to Vercel Edge Functions & Edge Middleware

### Using an edge-compatible driver

Vercel's Edge Runtime currently only supports a limited set of database drivers:

- [Neon Serverless](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) uses HTTP to access the database (also compatible with [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres))
- [PlanetScale Serverless](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver) uses HTTP to access the database
- [`@libsql/client`](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-client-ts) is used to access Turso databases

Note that [`node-postgres`](https://node-postgres.com/) (`pg`) is currently _not_ supported on Vercel Edge Functions.

When deploying a Vercel Edge Function that uses Prisma ORM, you need to use one of these [edge-compatible drivers](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/overview#edge-compatibility-of-database-drivers) and its respective [driver adapter](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) for Prisma ORM.

> **Note**: [Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate) enables you to access _any_ database from _any_ edge function provider. No edge-compatible driver is necessary.

### Setting your database connection URL as an environment variable

First, ensure that the `DATABASE_URL` is set as the `url` of the `datasource` in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql" // this might also be `mysql` or another value depending on your database
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

#### Development

When in **development**, you can configure your database connection via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (e.g. [using `.env` files](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables)).

#### Production

When deploying your Edge Function to **production**, you'll need to set the database connection using the `vercel` CLI:

```terminal
npx vercel env add DATABASE_URL
```

This command is interactive and will ask you to select environments and provide the value for the `DATABASE_URL` in subsequent steps.

Alternatively, you can configure the environment variable [via the UI](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#creating-environment-variables) of your project in the Vercel Dashboard.

### Generate Prisma Client in `postinstall` hook

In your `package.json`, you should add a `"postinstall"` section as follows:

```js file=package.json showLineNumbers
{
  // ...,
  "postinstall": "prisma generate"
}
```

### Size limits on free accounts

Vercel has a [size limit of 1 MB on free accounts](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/limitations). If your application bundle with Prisma ORM exceeds that size, we recommend upgrading to a paid account or using Prisma Accelerate to deploy your application.

## Database-specific considerations & examples

This section provides database-specific instructions for deploying a Vercel Edge Functions with Prisma ORM.

### Prerequisites

As a prerequisite for the following section, you need to have a Vercel Edge Function (which typically comes in the form of a Next.js API route) running locally and the Prisma and Vercel CLIs installed.

If you don't have that yet, you can run these commands to set up a Next.js app from scratch (following the instructions of the [Vercel Functions Quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/quickstart)):

```terminal
npm install -g vercel
npx create-next-app@latest
npm install prisma --save-dev
npx prisma init
```

We'll use the default `User` model for the example below:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}
```

### Vercel Postgres

If you are using Vercel Postgres, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-neon` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature) because Vercel Postgres uses [Neon](https://neon.tech/) under the hood
- be aware that Vercel by default calls the environment variable for the database connection string `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` while the default name used in the Prisma docs is typically `DATABASE_URL`; using Vercel's naming, you need to set the following fields on your `datasource` block:
  ```prisma
  datasource db {
    provider  = "postgresql"
    url       = env("POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL") // uses connection pooling
    directUrl = env("POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING") // uses a direct connection
  }
  ```

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema & database connection

> **Note**: If you don't have a project to deploy, follow the instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) to bootstrap a basic Next.js app with Prisma ORM in it.

First, ensure that the database connection is configured properly. In your Prisma schema, set the `url` of the `datasource` block to the `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` and the `directUrl` to the `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` environment variable. You also need to enable the `driverAdapters` feature flag:

```prisma file=schema.prisma showLineNumbers
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL") // uses connection pooling
  directUrl = env("POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING") // uses a direct connection
}
```

Next, you need to set the `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` and `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` environment variable to the values of your database connection.

If you ran `npx prisma init`, you can use the `.env` file that was created by this command to set these:

```bash file=.env showLineNumbers
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="postgres://user:password@host-pooler.region.postgres.vercel-storage.com:5432/name?pgbouncer=true&connect_timeout=15"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="postgres://user:password@host.region.postgres.vercel-storage.com:5432/name"
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-neon
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

#### 3. Configure `postinstall` hook

Next, add a new key to the `scripts` section in your `package.json`:

```js file=package.json highlight=5;add showLineNumbers
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    //add-next-line
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

#### 4. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If you ran `npx prisma init` above, you need to migrate your database schema to create the `User` table that's defined in your Prisma schema (if you already have all the tables you need in your database, you can skip this step):

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

#### 5. Use Prisma Client in your Vercel Edge Function to send a query to the database

If you created the project from scratch, you can create a new edge function as follows.

First, create a new API route, e.g. by using these commands:

```terminal
mkdir src/app/api
mkdir src/app/api/edge
touch src/app/api/edge/route.ts
```

Here is a sample code snippet that you can use to instantiate `PrismaClient` and send a query to your database in the new `app/api/edge/route.ts` file you just created:

```ts file=app/api/edge/route.ts showLineNumbers
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaNeon } from '@prisma/adapter-neon'
import { Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless'

export const runtime = 'edge'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const neon = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL })
  const adapter = new PrismaNeon(neon)
  const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

  const users = await prisma.user.findMany()

  return NextResponse.json(users, { status: 200 })
}
```

#### 6. Run the Edge Function locally

Run the app with the following command:

```terminal
npm run dev
```

You can now access the Edge Function via this URL: [`http://localhost:3000/api/edge`](http://localhost:3000/api/edge).

#### 7. Set the `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` environment variable and deploy the Edge Function

Run the following command to deploy your project with Vercel:

```terminal
npx vercel deploy
```

Note that once the project was created on Vercel, you will need to set the `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` environment variable (and if this was your first deploy, it likely failed). You can do this either via the Vercel UI or by running the following command:

```
npx vercel env add POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL
```

At this point, you can get the URL of the deployed application from the Vercel Dashboard and access the edge function via the `/api/edge` route.

### PlanetScale

If you are using a PlanetScale database, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-planetscale` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature)

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema & database connection

> **Note**: If you don't have a project to deploy, follow the instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) to bootstrap a basic Next.js app with Prisma ORM in it.

First, ensure that the database connection is configured properly. In your Prisma schema, set the `url` of the `datasource` block to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You also need to enable the `driverAdapters` feature flag:

```prisma file=schema.prisma showLineNumbers
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider     = "mysql"
  url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
  relationMode = "prisma" // required for PlanetScale (as by default foreign keys are disabled)
}
```

Next, you need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file that's used both by Prisma and Next.js to read your env vars:

```bash file=.env showLineNumbers
DATABASE_URL="mysql://32qxa2r7hfl3102wrccj:password@us-east.connect.psdb.cloud/demo-cf-worker-ps?sslaccept=strict"
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-planetscale
npm install @planetscale/database
```

#### 3. Configure `postinstall` hook

Next, add a new key to the `scripts` section in your `package.json`:

```js file=package.json highlight=5;add showLineNumbers
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    //add-next-line
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

#### 4. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If you ran `npx prisma init` above, you need to migrate your database schema to create the `User` table that's defined in your Prisma schema (if you already have all the tables you need in your database, you can skip this step):

```terminal
npx prisma db push
```

#### 5. Use Prisma Client in an Edge Function to send a query to the database

If you created the project from scratch, you can create a new edge function as follows.

First, create a new API route, e.g. by using these commands:

```terminal
mkdir src/app/api
mkdir src/app/api/edge
touch src/app/api/edge/route.ts
```

Here is a sample code snippet that you can use to instantiate `PrismaClient` and send a query to your database in the new `app/api/edge/route.ts` file you just created:

```ts file=app/api/edge/route.ts showLineNumbers
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaPlanetScale } from '@prisma/adapter-planetscale'
import { Client } from '@planetscale/database'

export const runtime = 'edge'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const client = new Client({ url: process.env.DATABASE_URL })
  const adapter = new PrismaPlanetScale(client)
  const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

  const users = await prisma.user.findMany()

  return NextResponse.json(users, { status: 200 })
}
```

#### 6. Run the Edge Function locally

Run the app with the following command:

```terminal
npm run dev
```

You can now access the Edge Function via this URL: [`http://localhost:3000/api/edge`](http://localhost:3000/api/edge).

#### 7. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and deploy the Edge Function

Run the following command to deploy your project with Vercel:

```terminal
npx vercel deploy
```

Note that once the project was created on Vercel, you will need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (and if this was your first deploy, it likely failed). You can do this either via the Vercel UI or by running the following command:

```
npx vercel env add DATABASE_URL
```

At this point, you can get the URL of the deployed application from the Vercel Dashboard and access the edge function via the `/api/edge` route.

### Neon

If you are using a Neon database, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-neon` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature)

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema & database connection

> **Note**: If you don't have a project to deploy, follow the instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) to bootstrap a basic Next.js app with Prisma ORM in it.

First, ensure that the database connection is configured properly. In your Prisma schema, set the `url` of the `datasource` block to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You also need to enable the `driverAdapters` feature flag:

```prisma file=schema.prisma showLineNumbers
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Next, you need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file that's used both by Prisma and Next.js to read your env vars:

```bash file=.env showLineNumbers
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:password@ep-nameless-pond-a23b1mdz.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-neon
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

#### 3. Configure `postinstall` hook

Next, add a new key to the `scripts` section in your `package.json`:

```js file=package.json highlight=5;add showLineNumbers
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    //add-next-line
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

#### 4. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If you ran `npx prisma init` above, you need to migrate your database schema to create the `User` table that's defined in your Prisma schema (if you already have all the tables you need in your database, you can skip this step):

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

#### 5. Use Prisma Client in an Edge Function to send a query to the database

If you created the project from scratch, you can create a new edge function as follows.

First, create a new API route, e.g. by using these commands:

```terminal
mkdir src/app/api
mkdir src/app/api/edge
touch src/app/api/edge/route.ts
```

Here is a sample code snippet that you can use to instantiate `PrismaClient` and send a query to your database in the new `app/api/edge/route.ts` file you just created:

```ts file=app/api/edge/route.ts showLineNumbers
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaNeon } from '@prisma/adapter-neon'
import { Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless'

export const runtime = 'edge'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const neon = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL })
  const adapter = new PrismaNeon(neon)
  const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

  const users = await prisma.user.findMany()

  return NextResponse.json(users, { status: 200 })
}
```

#### 6. Run the Edge Function locally

Run the app with the following command:

```terminal
npm run dev
```

You can now access the Edge Function via this URL: [`http://localhost:3000/api/edge`](http://localhost:3000/api/edge).

#### 7. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and deploy the Edge Function

Run the following command to deploy your project with Vercel:

```terminal
npx vercel deploy
```

Note that once the project was created on Vercel, you will need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (and if this was your first deploy, it likely failed). You can do this either via the Vercel UI or by running the following command:

```
npx vercel env add DATABASE_URL
```
