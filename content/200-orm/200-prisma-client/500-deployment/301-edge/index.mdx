If your application is deployed via an "Edge Function" offering or is deployed from a [serverless](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/serverless) offering and has a non-standard runtime, it is a _edge-deployed_ app. Common examples for such offerings include [Cloudflare Workers or Pages](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-cloudflare), [Vercel Edge Functions or Edge Middleware](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-vercel), and [Deno Deploy](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-deno-deploy).


:::tip Use Prisma ORM without Rust binaries

If Prisma's Rust engine binaries cause large bundle sizes, slow builds, or deployment issues (for example, in serverless or edge environments), you can switch to the [`queryCompiler`](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine) Preview feature introduced in [v6.7.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.7.0).

**When enabled, Prisma Client is generated without a Rust-based query engine binary**, reducing build artifacts and removing native binary dependencies:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["queryCompiler", "driverAdapters"]
}
```

Note that the [`driverAdapters`](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) Preview feature is **required** alongside `queryCompiler`.
When using this architecture:

* No Rust query engine binary is downloaded or shipped.
* The database connection pool is maintained by the native JS database driver you install (e.g., `@prisma/adapter-pg` for PostgreSQL).

This setup can simplify deployments in serverless or edge runtimes. Learn more in the [docs here](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine). Curious why we're moving away from the Rust engine? Take a look at why we're transitioning from Rust binary engines to an all-TypeScript approach for a faster, lighter Prisma ORM in our [blog post](https://www.prisma.io/blog/try-the-new-rust-free-version-of-prisma-orm-early-access).
