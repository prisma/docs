If your application is deployed via an "Edge Function" offering or is deployed from a [serverless](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/serverless) offering and has a non-standard runtime, it is a _edge-deployed_ app. Common examples for such offerings include [Cloudflare Workers or Pages](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-cloudflare), [Vercel Edge Functions or Edge Middleware](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-vercel), and [Deno Deploy](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-deno-deploy).
