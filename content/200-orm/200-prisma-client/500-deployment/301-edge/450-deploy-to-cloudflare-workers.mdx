## General considerations when deploying to Cloudflare Workers

This section covers _general_ things you need to be aware of when deploying to Cloudflare Workers and are using Prisma ORM, regardless of the database provider you use.

### Using an edge-compatible driver

When deploying a Cloudflare Worker that uses Prisma ORM, you need to use an [edge-compatible driver]() and its respective [driver adapter]() for Prisma ORM.

> **Note**: [Prisma Accelerate](/acccelerate) enables you to access _any_ database from _any_ edge function provider. No edge-compatible driver is necessary.

The edge-compatible drivers for Cloudflare Workers are:

- [Neon Serverless](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) uses HTTP to access the database
- [PlanetScale Serverless](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver) uses HTTP to access the database
- [`node-postgres`](https://node-postgres.com/) (`pg`) uses Cloudflare's `connect()` (TCP) to access the database

> **Note**: There's [also work being done](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/pull/2289) on the `node-mysql2` driver which will enable to access traditional MySQL databases from edge functions as well.

### Setting your database connection URL as an environment variable

First, ensure that the `DATABASE_URL` is set as the `url` of the `datasource` in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql" // this might also be `mysql` or another value depending on your database
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

#### Development

When using your Worker in **development**, you can configure your database connection via the [`.dev.vars` file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#secrets-in-development) locally.

Assuming you use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable from above, you can set it inside `.dev.vars` as follows:

```bash
# .dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
```

In the above snippet, `your-database-connection-string` is a placeholder that you need to replace with the value of your own connection string, for example:

```bash
# .dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb"
```

Note that **the `.dev.vars` file is not compatible with `.env` files which are typically used by Prisma ORM**.

This means that you need make sure that Prisma ORM gets access to the environemnt variable when needed, e.g. when running a Prisma CLI command like `prisma migrate dev`.

There are several options for achieving this:

- Run your Prisma CLI commands using `dotenv` to specify from where the CLI should read the environment variable, for example:
  ```terminal
  dotenv -e .dev.vars -- npx prisma migrate dev
  ```
- Create a script in `package.json` that reads `.dev.vars` via `dotenv`. You can then execute `prisma` commands as follows: `npm run env -- npx prisma migrate dev`. Here's a reference for the script:
  ```js
  "scripts":  { "env": "dotenv -e .dev.vars" }
  ```
- Duplicate the `DATABASE_URL` and any other relevant env vars into a new file called `.env`. that's used by Prisma ORM.

#### Production

When deploying your Worker to **production**, you'll need to set the database connection using the `wrangler` CLI:

```terminal
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL your-database-connection-string
```

In the above snippet, `your-database-connection-string` is a placeholder that you need to replace with the value of your own connection string, for example:

```terminal
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb
```

## Database-specific considerations & examples

This section provides database-specific instructions for deploying a Cloudflare Worker with Prisma ORM.

### Prerequisites

As a prerequisite for the following section, you need to have a Cloudflare Worker running locally and the Prisma CLI installed. If you don't have that yet, you can run these commands:

```terminal
npm create cloudflare@latest prisma-cloudflare-worker-example -- --type hello-world
cd prisma-cloudflare-worker-example
npm install prisma --save-dev
npx prisma init
```

We'll use the default `User` model for the example below:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}
```

### PostgreSQL (traditional)

If you are using a traditional PostgreSQL database that's accessed via TCP, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-pg` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature)
- set `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml`

<!-- <details><summary>Expand to see step-by-step deployment instructions</summary>

The following steps are the instructions to deploy the Cloudflare Worker.

</details>  -->

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema & database connection

First, ensure that database connection is configured properly. In your Prisma schema, set the `url` of the `datasource` block to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You also need to enable the `driverAdapters` feature flag:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Next, you need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the value of your database connection string. You'll do this in a file called `.dev.vars` used by Cloudflare:

```bash file=.dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb"
```

Because the Prisma CLI by default is only compatible with `.env` files, you can adjust your `package.json` with the following script that loads the env vars from `.dev.vars`. You can then use this script to load the env vars before executing a `prisma` command.

Add this script to your `package.json`:

```js file=package.json highlight=5;add
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ....
    "env": "dotenv -e .dev.vars"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Now you can execute Prisma CLI commands as follows while enusring that the command has access to the env vars in `.dev.vars`:

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-pg
npm install pg
npm install @types/pg --save-dev # if you're using TypeScript
```

#### 3. Set `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml`

In your `wranger.toml` file, add the following line:

```toml file=wranger.toml
node_compat = true
```

#### 4. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If you ran `npx prisma init` above, you need to migrate your database schema to create the `User` table that's defined in your Prisma schema (if you already have all the tables you need in your database, you can skip this step):

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

#### 5. Use Prisma Client in your Worker to send a query to the database

Here is a sample code snippet that you can code to instantiate `PrismaClient` and send a query to your database:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'
import { Pool } from 'pg'

export interface Env {
  DATABASE_URL: string
}

export default {
  async fetch(_: any, env: Env) {
    const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: env.DATABASE_URL })
    const adapter = new PrismaPg(pool)
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

    const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
    const result = JSON.stringify(users)
    return new Response(result)
  },
}
```

#### 6. Run the Worker locally

To run the Worker locally, you can run the `wrangler dev` command:

```terminal
npx wrangler dev
```

#### 7. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and deploy the worker

To deploy the worker, you first need to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable [via the `wrangler` CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#secrets-on-deployed-workers):

```terminal
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
```

The command is interactive and will ask you to enter the value for the `DATABASE_URL` env var as the next step in the terminal.

> **Note**: This command requires you to be authenticated, and will ask you to log in to your Cloudflare account in case you are not.

Then you can go ahead then deploy the worker:

```terminal
npx wrangler deploy
```

### PlanetScale

If you are using a PlanetScale database, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-planetscale` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature)
- manually remove the conflicting `cache`field ([learn more](<https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/native-integrations/planetscale/#:~:text=fetch%3A%20(,init)%3B>)):

  ```ts
  export default {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
      const client = new Client({
        url: env.DATABASE_URL,
        // see https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/698
        fetch(url, init) {
          delete init['cache']
          return fetch(url, init)
        },
      })
      const adapter = new PrismaPlanetScale(client)
      const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

      // ...
    },
  }
  ```

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema & database connection

First, ensure that database connection is configured properly. In your Prisma schema, set the `url` of the `datasource` block to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You also need to enable the `driverAdapters` feature flag:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider     = "mysql"
  url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
  relationMode = "prisma" // recommended for PlanetScale DBs
}
```

Next, you need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the value of your database connection string. You'll do this in a file called `.dev.vars` used by Cloudflare:

```bash file=.dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb"
```

Because the Prisma CLI by default is only compatible with `.env` files, you can adjust your `package.json` with the following script that loads the env vars from `.dev.vars`. You can then use this script to load the env vars before executing a `prisma` command.

Add this script to your `package.json`:

```js file=package.json highlight=5;add
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ....
    "env": "dotenv -e .dev.vars"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Now you can execute Prisma CLI commands as follows while enusring that the command has access to the env vars in `.dev.vars`:

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-planetscale
npm install @planetscale/database
```

#### 3. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If you ran `npx prisma init` above, you need to migrate your database schema to create the `User` table that's defined in your Prisma schema (if you already have all the tables you need in your database, you can skip this step):

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma db push
```

#### 4. Use Prisma Client in your Worker to send a query to the database

Here is a sample code snippet that you can code to instantiate `PrismaClient` and send a query to your database:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaPlanetScale } from '@prisma/adapter-planetscale'
import { Client } from '@planetscale/database'

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const client = new Client({
      url: env.DATABASE_URL,
      // see https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/698
      fetch(url, init) {
        delete init['cache']
        return fetch(url, init)
      },
    })
    const adapter = new PrismaPlanetScale(client)
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

    const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
    const result = JSON.stringify(users)
    return new Response(result)
  },
}
```

#### 6. Run the Worker locally

To run the Worker locally, you can run the `wrangler dev` command:

```terminal

Then you can go ahead then deploy the worker:

```terminal
npx wrangler deploy
```

### Neon

If you are using a Neon database, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-neon` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature)

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema & database connection

First, ensure that database connection is configured properly. In your Prisma schema, set the `url` of the `datasource` block to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You also need to enable the `driverAdapters` feature flag:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Next, you need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the value of your database connection string. You'll do this in a file called `.dev.vars` used by Cloudflare:

```bash file=.dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb"
```

Because the Prisma CLI by default is only compatible with `.env` files, you can adjust your `package.json` with the following script that loads the env vars from `.dev.vars`. You can then use this script to load the env vars before executing a `prisma` command.

Add this script to your `package.json`:

```js file=package.json highlight=5;add
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ....
    "env": "dotenv -e .dev.vars"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Now you can execute Prisma CLI commands as follows while enusring that the command has access to the env vars in `.dev.vars`:

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-neon
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

#### 3. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If you ran `npx prisma init` above, you need to migrate your database schema to create the `User` table that's defined in your Prisma schema (if you already have all the tables you need in your database, you can skip this step):

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

#### 5. Use Prisma Client in your Worker to send a query to the database

Here is a sample code snippet that you can code to instantiate `PrismaClient` and send a query to your database:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaNeon } from '@prisma/adapter-neon'
import { Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless'

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const neon = new Pool({ connectionString: env.DATABASE_URL })
    const adapter = new PrismaNeon(neon)
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

    const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
    const result = JSON.stringify(users)
    return new Response(result)
  },
}
```

#### 6. Run the Worker locally

To run the Worker locally, you can run the `wrangler dev` command:

```terminal
npx wrangler dev
```
