This page covers everything you need to know to deploy an app with Prisma ORM to a [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) or to [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages).

## General considerations when deploying to Cloudflare Workers

This section covers _general_ things you need to be aware of when deploying to Cloudflare Workers or Pages and are using Prisma ORM, regardless of the database provider you use.

### Using an edge-compatible driver

When deploying a Cloudflare Worker that uses Prisma ORM, you need to use an [edge-compatible driver](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/overview#edge-compatibility-of-database-drivers) and its respective [driver adapter](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) for Prisma ORM.

The edge-compatible drivers for Cloudflare Workers and Pages are:

- [Neon Serverless](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) uses HTTP to access the database
- [PlanetScale Serverless](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver) uses HTTP to access the database
- [`node-postgres`](https://node-postgres.com/) (`pg`) uses Cloudflare's `connect()` (TCP) to access the database
- [`@libsql/client`](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-client-ts) is used to access Turso databases via HTTP
- [Cloudflare D1](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-cloudflare#cloudflare-d1) is used to access D1 databases

There's [also work being done](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/pull/2289) on the `node-mysql2` driver which will enable access to traditional MySQL databases from Cloudflare Workers and Pages in the future as well.

> **Note**: [Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate) enables you to access _any_ database from _any_ edge function provider. No edge-compatible driver is necessary.

### Setting your database connection URL as an environment variable

First, ensure that the `DATABASE_URL` is set as the `url` of the `datasource` in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql" // this might also be `mysql` or another value depending on your database
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

#### Development

When using your Worker in **development**, you can configure your database connection via the [`.dev.vars` file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#secrets-in-development) locally.

Assuming you use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable from above, you can set it inside `.dev.vars` as follows:

```bash file=.dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
```

In the above snippet, `your-database-connection-string` is a placeholder that you need to replace with the value of your own connection string, for example:

```bash file=.dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb"
```

Note that the `.dev.vars` file is not compatible with `.env` files which are typically used by Prisma ORM.

This means that you need to make sure that Prisma ORM gets access to the environment variable when needed, e.g. when running a Prisma CLI command like `prisma migrate dev`.

There are several options for achieving this:

- Run your Prisma CLI commands using [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli) to specify from where the CLI should read the environment variable, for example:
  ```terminal
  dotenv -e .dev.vars -- npx prisma migrate dev
  ```
- Create a script in `package.json` that reads `.dev.vars` via [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli). You can then execute `prisma` commands as follows: `npm run env -- npx prisma migrate dev`. Here's a reference for the script:
  ```js file=package.json
  "scripts":  { "env": "dotenv -e .dev.vars" }
  ```
- Duplicate the `DATABASE_URL` and any other relevant env vars into a new file called `.env` which can then be used by Prisma ORM.

> **Note**: If you're using an approach that requires `dotenv`, you need to have the [`dotenv-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli) package installed. You can do this e.g. by using this command to install the package locally in your project: `npm install -D dotenv-cli`.

#### Production

When deploying your Worker to **production**, you'll need to set the database connection using the `wrangler` CLI:

```terminal
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
```

The command is interactive and will ask you to enter the value for the `DATABASE_URL` env var as the next step in the terminal.

> **Note**: This command requires you to be authenticated, and will ask you to log in to your Cloudflare account in case you are not.

### Size limits on free accounts

Cloudflare has a [size limit of 1 MB for Workers on the free plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/). If your application bundle with Prisma ORM exceeds that size, we recommend upgrading to a paid Worker plan or using Prisma Accelerate to deploy your application.

If you're running into this problem with `pg` and the `@prisma/adapter-pg` package, you can replace the `pg` with the custom [`@prisma/pg-worker`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/tree/main/packages/pg-worker) package and use the [`@prisma/adapter-pg-worker`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/tree/main/packages/adapter-pg-worker) adapter that belongs to it.

`@prisma/pg-worker` is an optimized and lightweight version of `pg` that is designed to be used in a Worker. It is a drop-in replacement for `pg` and is fully compatible with Prisma ORM.

### Deploying a Next.js app to Cloudflare Pages with `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`

Cloudflare offers an option to run Next.js apps on Cloudflare Pages with [`@cloudflare/next-on-pages`](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages), see the [docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-nextjs-site) for instructions.

Based on some testing, we found the following:

- You can deploy using the PlanetScale or Neon Serverless Driver.
- Traditional PostgreSQL deployments using `pg` don't work because `pg` itself currently does not work with `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` (see [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/issues/605)).

Feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord) if you find that anything has changed about this.

### Set `PRISMA_CLIENT_FORCE_WASM=1` when running locally with `node`

Some frameworks (e.g. [hono](https://hono.dev/)) use `node` instead of `wrangler` for running Workers locally. If you're using such a framework or are running your Worker locally with `node` for another reason, you need to set the `PRISMA_CLIENT_FORCE_WASM` environment variable:

```
export PRISMA_CLIENT_FORCE_WASM=1
```

## Database-specific considerations & examples

This section provides database-specific instructions for deploying a Cloudflare Worker with Prisma ORM.

### Prerequisites

As a prerequisite for the following section, you need to have a Cloudflare Worker running locally and the Prisma CLI installed.

If you don't have that yet, you can run these commands:

```terminal
npm create cloudflare@latest prisma-cloudflare-worker-example -- --type hello-world
cd prisma-cloudflare-worker-example
npm install prisma --save-dev
npx prisma init
```

You'll further need a database instance of your database provider of choice available. Refer to the respective documentation of the provider for setting up that instance.

We'll use the default `User` model for the example below:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}
```

### PostgreSQL (traditional)

If you are using a traditional PostgreSQL database that's accessed via TCP and the `pg` driver, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-pg` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature)
- set `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml` (see the [Cloudflare docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#add-polyfills-using-wrangler))

If you are running into a size issue and can't deploy your application because of that, you can use our slimmer variant of the `pg` driver package [`@prisma/pg-worker`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/tree/main/packages/pg-worker) and the [`@prisma/adapter-pg-worker`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/tree/main/packages/adapter-pg-worker) adapter that belongs to it.

`@prisma/pg-worker` is an optimized and lightweight version of `pg` that is designed to be used in a Worker. It is a drop-in replacement for `pg` and is fully compatible with Prisma ORM.

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema & database connection

> **Note**: If you don't have a project to deploy, follow the instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) to bootstrap a basic Cloudflare Worker with Prisma ORM in it.

First, ensure that the database connection is configured properly. In your Prisma schema, set the `url` of the `datasource` block to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You also need to enable the `driverAdapters` feature flag:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Next, you need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the value of your database connection string. You'll do this in a file called `.dev.vars` used by Cloudflare:

```bash file=.dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb"
```

Because the Prisma CLI by default is only compatible with `.env` files, you can adjust your `package.json` with the following script that loads the env vars from `.dev.vars`. You can then use this script to load the env vars before executing a `prisma` command.

Add this script to your `package.json`:

```js file=package.json highlight=5;add
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ....
    "env": "dotenv -e .dev.vars"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Now you can execute Prisma CLI commands as follows while ensuring that the command has access to the env vars in `.dev.vars`:

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-pg
npm install pg
npm install @types/pg --save-dev # if you're using TypeScript
```

#### 3. Set `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml`

In your `wrangler.toml` file, add the following line:

```toml file=wrangler.toml
node_compat = true
```

> **Note**: For Cloudflare Pages, using `node_compat` is not officially supported. If you want to use `pg` in Cloudflare Pages, you can find a workaround [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2541#issuecomment-1954209855).

#### 4. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If you ran `npx prisma init` above, you need to migrate your database schema to create the `User` table that's defined in your Prisma schema (if you already have all the tables you need in your database, you can skip this step):

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

#### 5. Use Prisma Client in your Worker to send a query to the database

Here is a sample code snippet that you can use to instantiate `PrismaClient` and send a query to your database:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'
import { Pool } from 'pg'

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: env.DATABASE_URL })
    const adapter = new PrismaPg(pool)
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

    const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
    const result = JSON.stringify(users)
    return new Response(result)
  },
}
```

#### 6. Run the Worker locally

To run the Worker locally, you can run the `wrangler dev` command:

```terminal
npx wrangler dev
```

#### 7. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and deploy the Worker

To deploy the Worker, you first need to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable [via the `wrangler` CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#secrets-on-deployed-workers):

```terminal
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
```

The command is interactive and will ask you to enter the value for the `DATABASE_URL` env var as the next step in the terminal.

> **Note**: This command requires you to be authenticated, and will ask you to log in to your Cloudflare account in case you are not.

Then you can go ahead then deploy the Worker:

```terminal
npx wrangler deploy
```

The command will output the URL where you can access the deployed Worker.

### PlanetScale

If you are using a PlanetScale database, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-planetscale` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature)
- manually remove the conflicting `cache` field ([learn more](<https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/native-integrations/planetscale/#:~:text=fetch%3A%20(,init)%3B>)):

  ```ts
  export default {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
      const client = new Client({
        url: env.DATABASE_URL,
        // see https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/698
        fetch(url, init) {
          delete init['cache']
          return fetch(url, init)
        },
      })
      const adapter = new PrismaPlanetScale(client)
      const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

      // ...
    },
  }
  ```

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema & database connection

> **Note**: If you don't have a project to deploy, follow the instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) to bootstrap a basic Cloudflare Worker with Prisma ORM in it.

First, ensure that the database connection is configured properly. In your Prisma schema, set the `url` of the `datasource` block to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You also need to enable the `driverAdapters` feature flag:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider     = "mysql"
  url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
  relationMode = "prisma" // required for PlanetScale (as by default foreign keys are disabled)
}
```

Next, you need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the value of your database connection string. You'll do this in a file called `.dev.vars` used by Cloudflare:

```bash file=.dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="mysql://32qxa2r7hfl3102wrccj:password@us-east.connect.psdb.cloud/demo-cf-worker-ps?sslaccept=strict"
```

Because the Prisma CLI by default is only compatible with `.env` files, you can adjust your `package.json` with the following script that loads the env vars from `.dev.vars`. You can then use this script to load the env vars before executing a `prisma` command.

Add this script to your `package.json`:

```js file=package.json highlight=5;add
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ....
    "env": "dotenv -e .dev.vars"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Now you can execute Prisma CLI commands as follows while ensuring that the command has access to the env vars in `.dev.vars`:

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-planetscale
npm install @planetscale/database
```

#### 3. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If you ran `npx prisma init` above, you need to migrate your database schema to create the `User` table that's defined in your Prisma schema (if you already have all the tables you need in your database, you can skip this step):

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma db push
```

#### 4. Use Prisma Client in your Worker to send a query to the database

Here is a sample code snippet that you can use to instantiate `PrismaClient` and send a query to your database:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaPlanetScale } from '@prisma/adapter-planetscale'
import { Client } from '@planetscale/database'

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const client = new Client({
      url: env.DATABASE_URL,
      // see https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/698
      fetch(url, init) {
        delete init['cache']
        return fetch(url, init)
      },
    })
    const adapter = new PrismaPlanetScale(client)
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

    const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
    const result = JSON.stringify(users)
    return new Response(result)
  },
}
```

#### 6. Run the Worker locally

To run the Worker locally, you can run the `wrangler dev` command:

```terminal
npx wrangler dev
```

#### 7. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and deploy the Worker

To deploy the Worker, you first need to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable [via the `wrangler` CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#secrets-on-deployed-workers):

```terminal
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
```

The command is interactive and will ask you to enter the value for the `DATABASE_URL` env var as the next step in the terminal.

> **Note**: This command requires you to be authenticated, and will ask you to log in to your Cloudflare account in case you are not.

Then you can go ahead then deploy the Worker:

```terminal
npx wrangler deploy
```

The command will output the URL where you can access the deployed Worker.

### Neon

If you are using a Neon database, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-neon` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature)

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema & database connection

> **Note**: If you don't have a project to deploy, follow the instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) to bootstrap a basic Cloudflare Worker with Prisma ORM in it.

First, ensure that the database connection is configured properly. In your Prisma schema, set the `url` of the `datasource` block to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You also need to enable the `driverAdapters` feature flag:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Next, you need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the value of your database connection string. You'll do this in a file called `.dev.vars` used by Cloudflare:

```bash file=.dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:password@ep-nameless-pond-a23b1mdz.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
```

Because the Prisma CLI by default is only compatible with `.env` files, you can adjust your `package.json` with the following script that loads the env vars from `.dev.vars`. You can then use this script to load the env vars before executing a `prisma` command.

Add this script to your `package.json`:

```js file=package.json highlight=5;add
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ....
    "env": "dotenv -e .dev.vars"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Now you can execute Prisma CLI commands as follows while ensuring that the command has access to the env vars in `.dev.vars`:

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-neon
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

#### 3. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If you ran `npx prisma init` above, you need to migrate your database schema to create the `User` table that's defined in your Prisma schema (if you already have all the tables you need in your database, you can skip this step):

```terminal
npm run env -- npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

#### 5. Use Prisma Client in your Worker to send a query to the database

Here is a sample code snippet that you can use to instantiate `PrismaClient` and send a query to your database:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaNeon } from '@prisma/adapter-neon'
import { Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless'

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const neon = new Pool({ connectionString: env.DATABASE_URL })
    const adapter = new PrismaNeon(neon)
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

    const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
    const result = JSON.stringify(users)
    return new Response(result)
  },
}
```

#### 6. Run the Worker locally

To run the Worker locally, you can run the `wrangler dev` command:

```terminal
npx wrangler dev
```

#### 7. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and deploy the Worker

To deploy the Worker, you first need to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable [via the `wrangler` CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#secrets-on-deployed-workers):

```terminal
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
```

The command is interactive and will ask you to enter the value for the `DATABASE_URL` env var as the next step in the terminal.

> **Note**: This command requires you to be authenticated, and will ask you to log in to your Cloudflare account in case you are not.

Then you can go ahead then deploy the Worker:

```terminal
npx wrangler deploy
```

The command will output the URL where you can access the deployed Worker.

### Cloudflare D1

If you are using a D1 database, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-d1` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature)
- set `sqlite` as the `datasource` provider in your Prisma schema
- manually generate SQL statements for schema changes using `prisma migrate diff` but execute them using [D1's migration system](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/migrations/)

You can find a [deployment-ready example on GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/deployment-platforms/edge/cloudflare-workers/with-d1).

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema

> **Note**: If you don't have a project to deploy, follow the instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) to bootstrap a basic Cloudflare Worker with Prisma ORM in it.

In your Prisma schema, add the `driverAdapters` Preview feature to the `generator` block and set the `provider` of the `datasource` to `sqlite`. If you just bootstrapped the Prisma schema with `prisma init`, also be sure to add the following `User` model to it:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}
```

Note that in this tutorial, you won't need the `.env` file since the connection between Prisma ORM and D1 will happen through a [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/bindings/).

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-d1
```

Also, be sure to use a version of the Wrangler CLI that's above [`wrangler@^3.39.0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/releases/tag/wrangler%403.39.0), otherwise the `--remote` flag that's used in the next sections won't be available.

#### 3. Set the D1 database connection via a binding

To connect your Workers with the D1 instance, add the following binding to your `wrangler.toml` (if you don't have a D1 instance yet, you can create one using the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) or with the [`wrangler d1 create`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#create) command):

```toml file=wrangler.toml
name = "prisma-cloudflare-worker-example"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-03-20"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.DB
database_name = "__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__" # to be replaced
database_id = "__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID__"     # to be replaced
```

Note that `__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__` and `__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID__` in the snippet above are placeholders that should be replaced with the database name and ID of your own D1 instance.

If you weren't able to grab this ID from the terminal output, you can also find it in the Cloudflare Dashboard or by running `npx wrangler d1 list` and `npx wrangler d1 info __YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__` in your terminal.

#### 4. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If your Prisma schema only contains the `User` model but your D1 database is still empty, you need to make sure that there is a table in D1 that mirrors the structure of the `User` model.

D1 comes with its own [migration system](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/migrations/) that lets you manage migration files in your file system. While this is convenient for creating and applying migration files, it doesn't help you identifying the actual SQL statements that you need to put into these migration files. That's where Prisma Migrate comes into play, because you can generate SQL statements for schema changes using the [`prisma migrate diff`](/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference#migrate-diff) command.

First, create the `migrations` directory and initial migration file using the [`wrangler d1 migrations`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#migrations-create) command as follows:

```terminal
npx wrangler d1 migrations create __YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__ create_user_table
```

Replace `__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__` with the name of your database again and, when prompted, confirm that you want to create the `migrations` directory. After having run this command, there should be a new folder called `migrations` with a file called `0001_create_user_table.sql` inside of it.

You can now generate the required SQL statement for creating a `User` table that can be mapped to the `User` model in your the Prisma schema as follows:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema-datamodel ./prisma/schema.prisma --script --output migrations/0001_create_user_table.sql
```

Note that the resulting SQL statement is stored in a file in the `migrations` directory called `0001_create_user_table.sql` which looks as follows:

```sql file=migrations/0001_create_user_table.sql no-copy
-- CreateTable
CREATE TABLE "User" (
    "id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "email" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "name" TEXT
);

-- CreateIndex
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "User_email_key" ON "User"("email");
```

You now need to use the [`wrangler d1 migrations apply`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#migrations-apply) command to send this SQL statement to D1. Note that this command accepts two options:

- `--local`: Executes the statement against a _local_ version of D1. This local version of D1 is a SQLite database file that'll be located in your project. This approach is useful, when you want to develop and test your Worker on your local machine. Learn more in the [Cloudflare docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/configuration/local-development/).
- `--remote`: Executes the statement against your _remote_ version of D1. This version is used by your _deployed_ Cloudflare Workers. Learn more in the [Cloudflare docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/configuration/remote-development/).

In this tutorial, you'll do both: test the Worker locally _and_ deploy it afterwards. So, you need to run both commands. Open your terminal and paste the following commands:

```terminal
# For the local database
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply __YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__ --local

# For the remote database
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply __YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__ --remote
```

As before, you need to replace `__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__` with the name of your D1 database.

Let's also create some dummy data that we can query once the Worker is running. This time, you'll run the SQL statement without storing it in a file:

```terminal
# For the local database
npx wrangler d1 execute __YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__ --command "INSERT INTO  \"User\" (\"email\", \"name\") VALUES
('jane@prisma.io', 'Jane Doe (Local)');" --local

# For the remote database
npx wrangler d1 execute __YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__ --command "INSERT INTO  \"User\" (\"email\", \"name\") VALUES
('jane@prisma.io', 'Jane Doe (Remote)');" --remote
```

#### 5. Use Prisma Client in your Worker to send a query to the database

Before adding a Prisma Client query to your Worker, you need to generate Prisma Client with the following command:

```
npx prisma generate
```

In order to query your database from the Worker using Prisma ORM, you need to:

1. Add the `DB` binding to the `Env` interface. (Alternatively, you can run [`npx wrangler types`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#types) to generate the `Env` type from the binding in a separate file called `worker-configuration.d.ts`.)
2. Instantiate `PrismaClient` using the `PrismaD1` driver adapter.
3. Send a query using Prisma Client and return the result.

Open `src/index.ts` and replace the entire content with the following:

```typescript file=src/index.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaD1 } from '@prisma/adapter-d1'

export interface Env {
  DB: D1Database
}

export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<Response> {
    const adapter = new PrismaD1(env.DB)
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

    const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
    const result = JSON.stringify(users)
    return new Response(result)
  },
}
```

#### 6. Run the Worker locally

With the database query in place and Prisma Client generated, you can go ahead and run the Worker locally:

```
npm run dev
```

Now you can open your browser at [`http://localhost:8787`](http://localhost:8787/) to see the result of the database query:

```js no-copy
;[{ id: 1, email: 'jane@prisma.io', name: 'Jane Doe (Local)' }]
```

#### 7. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and deploy the Worker

To deploy the Worker, run the the following command:

```
npm run deploy
```

Your deployed Worker is accessible via `https://prisma-d1-example.USERNAME.workers.dev`. If you navigate your browser to that URL, you should see the following data that's queried from your remote D1 database:

```js no-copy
;[{ id: 1, email: 'jane@prisma.io', name: 'Jane Doe (Remote)' }]
```
