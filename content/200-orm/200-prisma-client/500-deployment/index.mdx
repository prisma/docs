This section describes how to deploy Node.js applications that use Prisma Client and TypeScript to various platforms.

:::tip Use Prisma ORM without Rust binaries

If Prismaâ€™s Rust engine binaries cause large bundle sizes, slow builds, or deployment issues (for example, in serverless or edge environments), you can switch to the [`queryCompiler`](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine) Preview feature introduced in [v6.7.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.7.0).

**When enabled, Prisma Client is generated without a Rust-based query engine binary**, reducing build artifacts and removing native binary dependencies:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["queryCompiler", "driverAdapters"]
}
```

Note that the [`driverAdapters`](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) Preview feature is **required** alongside `queryCompiler`.
When using this architecture:

* No Rust query engine binary is downloaded or shipped.
* The database connection pool is maintained by the native JS database driver you install (e.g., `@prisma/adapter-pg` for PostgreSQL).

This setup can simplify deployments in:

* Serverless functions
* Edge runtimes
* Read-only filesystem environments
* CI/CD pipelines with strict size limits

Learn more in the [docs here](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine). Curious why we're moving away from the Rust engine? Take a look at why we're transitioning from Rust binary engines to an all-TypeScript approach for a faster, lighter Prisma ORM in our [blog post](https://www.prisma.io/blog/try-the-new-rust-free-version-of-prisma-orm-early-access).
