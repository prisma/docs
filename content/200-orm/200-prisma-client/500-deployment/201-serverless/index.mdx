If your application is deployed via a "Serverless Function" or "Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)" offering and uses a standard Node.js runtime, it is a serverless app. Common deployment examples include [AWS Lambda](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/serverless/deploy-to-aws-lambda) and [Vercel Serverless Functions](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/serverless/deploy-to-vercel).

:::tip Use Prisma ORM without Rust binaries

If Prisma’s Rust engine binaries cause large bundle sizes, slow builds, or deployment issues (for example, in serverless or edge environments), you can switch to the [`queryCompiler`](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine) Preview feature introduced in [v6.7.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.7.0).

**When enabled, Prisma Client is generated without a Rust-based query engine binary**, reducing build artifacts and removing native binary dependencies:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["queryCompiler", "driverAdapters"]
}
```

Note that the [`driverAdapters`](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) Preview feature is **required** alongside `queryCompiler`.
When using this architecture:

* No Rust query engine binary is downloaded or shipped.
* The database connection pool is maintained by the native JS database driver you install (e.g., `@prisma/adapter-pg` for PostgreSQL).

This setup can simplify deployments in:

* Serverless functions
* Edge runtimes
* Read-only filesystem environments
* CI/CD pipelines with strict size limits

Learn more in the [docs here](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine). To understand the reasoning behind eventually removing the Rust engine from Prisma ORM, read our [blog post](https://www.prisma.io/blog/try-the-new-rust-free-version-of-prisma-orm-early-access).
