If your application is deployed via a "Serverless Function" or "Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)" offering and uses a standard Node.js runtime, it is a serverless app. Common deployment examples include [AWS Lambda](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/serverless/deploy-to-aws-lambda) and [Vercel Serverless Functions](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/serverless/deploy-to-vercel).
