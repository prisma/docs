Prisma Client depends on the [query engine](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines) that is running as a binary on the same host as your application.

:::

As of [v6.7.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.7.0), Prisma ORM has the `queryCompiler` Preview feature. When enabled, your Prisma Client will be generated without a query engine binary:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["queryCompiler", "driverAdapters"] 
}
```

> Note that the [driver adapters](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) Preview feature is required alongside `queryCompiler`.

:::


The query engine is implemented in Rust and is used by Prisma Client in the form of executable binary files. The binary is downloaded when `prisma generate` is called.

If you have developed your application on a Windows machine for example, and wish to upload to AWS Lambda, which is a Linux environment, you may encounter issues and be presented with some warnings in your terminal.

To solve this, if you know ahead of time that you will be deploying to a different environment, you can use the [binary targets](/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators#binary-targets) and specify which of the [supported operating systems](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) binaries should be included.

> **Note**: If your OS isn't supported you can include a [custom binary](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines#using-custom-engine-libraries-or-binaries).
