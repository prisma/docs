Prisma Client depends on the [query engine](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines) that is running as a binary on the same host as your application.

:::note

As of [v6.16.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.16.0), Prisma ORM can be used without Rust engines in production applications. Learn more [here](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine).

**When enabled, your Prisma Client will be generated without a Rust-based query engine binary**:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider   = "prisma-client-js" // or "prisma-client"
  output     = "../src/generated/prisma"
  engineType = "client"           // no Rust engine
}
```

Note that [driver adapters](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) are required if you want to use Prisma ORM without Rust engines.

You can [read about the performance and DX improvements](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-orm-without-rust-latest-performance-benchmarks) of this change on our blog.

:::

The query engine is implemented in Rust and is used by Prisma Client in the form of executable binary files. The binary is downloaded when `prisma generate` is called.

If you have developed your application on a Windows machine for example, and wish to upload to AWS Lambda, which is a Linux environment, you may encounter issues and be presented with some warnings in your terminal.

To solve this, if you know ahead of time that you will be deploying to a different environment, you can use the [binary targets](/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators#binary-targets) and specify which of the [supported operating systems](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) binaries should be included.

> **Note**: If your OS isn't supported you can include a [custom binary](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines#using-custom-engine-libraries-or-binaries).
