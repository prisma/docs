## Overview

_Module bundlers_ bundle JavaScript modules into a single JavaScript file. Most bundlers work by copying over the JavaScript code from a variety of source files into the target file.

Since Prisma Client is not only based on JavaScript code, but also relies on the [**query engine binary file**](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines#the-query-engine-file) to be available, you need to make sure that your bundled code has access to the binary file.

:::note

As of [v6.7.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.7.0), Prisma ORM has the `queryCompiler` Preview feature.

**When enabled, your Prisma Client will be generated [without a Rust-based query engine binary](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine)**:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["queryCompiler", "driverAdapters"]
}
```

Note that the [driver adapters](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) Preview feature is required alongside `queryCompiler`. When using the `queryCompiler` Preview feature, the connection pool is maintained by the native JS database driver you're using.

To do so, you can use plugins that let you copy over static assets:
