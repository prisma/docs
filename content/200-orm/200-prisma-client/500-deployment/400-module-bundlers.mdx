## Overview

_Module bundlers_ bundle JavaScript modules into a single JavaScript file. Most bundlers work by copying over the JavaScript code from a variety of source files into the target file.

Since Prisma Client is not only based on JavaScript code, but also relies on the [**query engine binary file**](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines#the-query-engine-file) to be available, you need to make sure that your bundled code has access to the binary file.

:::note

As of [v6.16.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.16.0), Prisma ORM can be used without Rust engines in production applications. Learn more [here](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine).

**When enabled, your Prisma Client will be generated without a Rust-based query engine binary**:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider   = "prisma-client-js" // or "prisma-client"
  output     = "../src/generated/prisma"
  engineType = "client"           // no Rust engine
}
```

Note that [driver adapters](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) are required if you want to use Prisma ORM without Rust engines.

You can [read about the performance and DX improvements](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-orm-without-rust-latest-performance-benchmarks) of this change on our blog.

To do so, you can use plugins that let you copy over static assets:
