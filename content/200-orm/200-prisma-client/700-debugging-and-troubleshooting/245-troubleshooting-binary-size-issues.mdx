If you encounter **large bundle sizes**, **slow builds**, or **deployment errors** related to Prismaâ€™s Rust engine binaries, for example, in serverless or edge environments, the issue may be caused by the default native Rust query engine that ships with Prisma Client.

As of [v6.16.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.16.0), you can resolve these issues by removing the Rust-based engine binary from Prisma ORM by configuring your `generator` block as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider   = "prisma-client-js"
  engineType = "client"
}
````

:::note
Note that you need to use a [driver adapter](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) in this case.
:::

With this architecture:

- No Rust query engine binary is downloaded or shipped.
- The database connection pool is maintained by the native JS database driver you install (e.g., `@prisma/adapter-pg` for PostgreSQL).

This setup can help if you are:

- Deploying to serverless functions or edge runtimes
- Running in read-only filesystem environments
- Working within CI/CD pipelines with strict size limits

Curious why we moved away from the Rust engine? Take a look at why we transitioned from Rust binary engines to an all-TypeScript approach for a faster, lighter Prisma ORM in this [blog post](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-orm-without-rust-latest-performance-benchmarks).
