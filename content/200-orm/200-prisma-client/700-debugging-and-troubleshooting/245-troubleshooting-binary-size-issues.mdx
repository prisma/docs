If you encounter **large bundle sizes**, **slow builds**, or **deployment errors** related to Prismaâ€™s Rust engine binaries, for example, in serverless or edge environments, the issue may be caused by the default native Rust query engine that ships with Prisma Client.

As of [v6.7.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.7.0), you can resolve these issues by enabling the [`queryCompiler`](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine) Preview feature.  
When enabled, Prisma Client is generated **without a Rust-based query engine binary**, reducing build artifacts and removing native binary dependencies.

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["queryCompiler", "driverAdapters"]
}
````

:::note
The [`driverAdapters`](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) Preview feature is **required** alongside `queryCompiler`. 
:::

With this architecture:

* No Rust query engine binary is downloaded or shipped.
* The database connection pool is maintained by the native JavaScript database driver you install (e.g., `@prisma/adapter-pg` for PostgreSQL).

This setup can help if you are:

* Deploying to serverless functions or edge runtimes
* Running in read-only filesystem environments
* Working within CI/CD pipelines with strict size limits
