The **TypeScript-only Prisma Client** improves compatibility for Prisma ORM across various Node.js environments, including those using ECMAScript modules (ESM). 

It is generated by specifying the `prisma-client-ts` generator in the Prisma schema and is currently in [Preview](/orm/more/releases#preview). 

This approach lets you bundle your application code according to your own preferences while keeping the generated Prisma type definitions outside of `node_modules` in a dedicated folder alongside the other parts of your codebase. With the generated Prisma Client being explicitly part of your application bundle, you avoid hidden magic and gain greater control over your project's configuration.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to generate and integrate the TS-only Prisma Client into your project.

### 1. Use the `prisma-client-ts` generator in your Prisma schema

First, update the [`generator`](/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators) block in your `schema.prisma` file. Ensure that both the `provider` and the `output` path are correctly configured. This step tells Prisma to use the TypeScript-only client and determines into which folder the Prisma Client code will be generated.

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-ts"
  output   = "./generated/prisma-client-ts"
}
```

:::note  
The output path is required. You can choose any location that suits your project structure, the generator will place the TypeScript definitions there.  
:::

### 2. Generate the types

Once you have updated your Prisma schema, run the following command to generate the client types:

```terminal
npx prisma generate
```

This command compiles all the necessary TypeScript definitions and the query engine into the specified output directory.

### 3. Add the generated types to `.gitignore`

Since the `"prisma-client-ts"` generator produces both the Prisma types and the query engine, it is important to exclude this folder from your version control. This avoids potential compilation issues when the code is run on another machine.

Add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

```diff
+/prisma/generated/prisma-client-ts
```

:::note

In the future, this step may become unnecessary as we transition [Prisma ORM from Rust to TypeScript](https://www.prisma.io/blog/rust-to-typescript-update-boosting-prisma-orm-performance?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=inline_text).

:::

### 4. Use the generated types in your application code

After generating the client, you can import and use it directly in your project. Import the client by specifying the path to the generated file, not the folder:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "./prisma/generated/prisma-client-ts/client.ts"

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

:::note[important]

Ensure that you import from the file `./prisma/generated/prisma-client-ts/client.ts` rather than the directory itself. This guarantees that you are referencing the correct module.

By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional TS-only Prisma Client integrated into your Node.js application.
