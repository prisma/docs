The **TypeScript-only Prisma Client** improves compatibility for Prisma ORM across various Node.js environments, including those using ECMAScript modules (ESM). 

It is generated by specifying the `prisma-client-ts` generator in the Prisma schema and is currently in [Preview](/orm/more/releases#preview). 

This approach lets you bundle your application code according to your own preferences while keeping the generated Prisma type definitions outside of `node_modules` in a dedicated folder alongside the other parts of your codebase. With the generated Prisma Client being explicitly part of your application bundle, you avoid hidden magic and gain greater control over your project's configuration.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to generate and integrate the TS-only Prisma Client into your project.

### 1. Use the `prisma-client-ts` generator in your Prisma schema

First, update the [`generator`](/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators) block in your `schema.prisma` file. Ensure that both the `provider` and the `output` path are correctly configured. This step tells Prisma to use the TypeScript-only client and determines into which folder the Prisma Client code will be generated.

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-ts"
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma-client"
}
```

When using the `prisma-client-ts` generator, the `output` path is required. You can choose any location that suits your project structure. In the example above, we assume that your project has a `src` directory that's on the same level as the `prisma` directory, for example:

```
.
├── package.json
├── prisma
│   └── schema.prisma
├── src
│   └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```


### 2. Generate Prisma Client

Once you have updated your Prisma schema, run the following command to generate the client types:

```terminal
npx prisma generate
```

This command compiles all the necessary TypeScript definitions and the query engine into the specified output directory.

### 3. Add the generated types to `.gitignore`

The `prisma-client-ts` generator creates both the Prisma Client TypeScript code and the [query engine](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines#the-query-engine-file) and puts them into the targeted directory. In order to avoid potential [compatibility issues with the query engine](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines#defining-the-query-engine-type-for-prisma-client) when the application is deployed (or otherwise executed on a different machine), we strongly recommend to exclude the generated folder from your version control.

Add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

```bash file=.gitignore
// add-next-line
/prisma/generated/prisma-client
```

:::note

In the future, you will be able to keep generated code in version control as we transition [the query engine from Rust to TypeScript](https://www.prisma.io/blog/rust-to-typescript-update-boosting-prisma-orm-performance?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=inline_text). Once that is done, there won't be any compatibility issues related to the query engine any more.

### 4. Use the generated Prisma Client in your application code

After generating the client, you can import and use it directly in your project. Import the client by specifying the path to the generated file, not the folder:

```ts file=src/index.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma-client/client.ts"

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

:::note[important]

Ensure that you import from the file `./prisma/generated/prisma-client-ts/client.ts` rather than the directory itself. This guarantees that you are referencing the correct module.

By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional TS-only Prisma Client integrated into your Node.js application.
