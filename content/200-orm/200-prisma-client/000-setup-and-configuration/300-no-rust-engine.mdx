As of [v6.7.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.7.0), you can use Prisma ORM without [Rust engine](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines) binaries on PostgreSQL, SQLite and D1 databases.

This page gives an overview of how to use this version of Prisma ORM.

## Prisma ORM without Rust engines

The main technical differences if you're using Prisma ORM without a Rust engine are:

- no `binaryTargets` and `engineType` fields on the `generator` block
- no query engine binary that's downloaded into the directory with your generated Prisma Client
- required usage of [driver adapters](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) for database connection management

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Prisma ORM v6.7.0 (or later)

### 1. Set feature flags

Usage of the new architecture requires the `driverAdapters` and `queryCompiler` feature flags to be set:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js" // or `prisma-client`
  previewFeatures = ["queryCompiler", "driverAdapters"]
  output          = "../generated/prisma"
}
```

### 2. Re-generate Prisma Client

To make the feature flags take effect, you need re-generate Prisma Client:

```terminal
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. Install the driver adapter

Depending on the database you use, you need to install a different driver adapter library:

For **PostgreSQL**:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-pg
```

For **SQLite**:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3
```

For **D1**:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-d1
```

### 4. Instantiate Prisma Client

Finally, you need to instantiate Prisma Client which you can do using the driver adapter and the connection URL for the database instance you're using.

For **PostgreSQL**:

```ts
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma'

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL })
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

For **SQLite**:

```ts
import { PrismaBetterSQLite3 } from '@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3';
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma';

const adapter = new PrismaBetterSQLite3({ url: process.env.DATABASE_URL })
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter });
```

For **D1**:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaD1 } from '@prisma/adapter-d1'

export interface Env {
  DB: D1Database
}

export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<Response> {
    const adapter = new PrismaD1(env.DB)
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

    // ... query your DB
  },
}
```

### 5. Query your database

If you went through the previous steps, you can query your database as you're used to with Prisma Client. No other changes are needed.
