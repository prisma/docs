Prisma Client is a generated database client that's tailored to your database schema. By default, Prisma Client is generated into the `node_modules/.prisma/client` folder, but we highly recommend [you specify an output location](#using-a-custom-output-path).

:::warning

In Prisma ORM 7, Prisma Client will no longer be generated in `node_modules` by default and will require an output path to be defined. [Learn more below on how to define an output path](#using-a-custom-output-path).

:::

To generate and instantiate Prisma Client:

1. Ensure that you have [Prisma CLI installed on your machine](/orm/tools/prisma-cli#installation).

   ```terminal
   npm install prisma --save-dev
   ```

1. Add the following `generator` definition to your Prisma schema:

   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
     output   = "app/generated/prisma/client"
   }
   ```

   :::note

   Feel free to customize the output location to match your application. Common directories are `app`, `src`, or even the root of your project.

   :::

1. Install the `@prisma/client` npm package:

   ```terminal
   npm install @prisma/client
   ```

1. Generate Prisma Client with the following command:

   ```terminal
   prisma generate
   ```

1. You can now [instantiate Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/instantiate-prisma-client) in your code:

  ```ts
  import { PrismaClient } from 'app/generated/prisma/client'
  const prisma = new PrismaClient()
  // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
  ```

> **Important**: You need to re-run the `prisma generate` command after every change that's made to your Prisma schema to update the generated Prisma Client code.

Here is a graphical illustration of the typical workflow for generation of Prisma Client:

![Graphical illustration of the typical workflow for generation of Prisma Client](./prisma-client-generation-workflow.png)

## The `@prisma/client` npm package

The `@prisma/client` npm package consists of two key parts:

- The `@prisma/client` module itself, which only changes when you re-install the package
- The `.prisma/client` folder, which is the [default location](#using-a-custom-output-path) for the unique Prisma Client generated from your schema

`@prisma/client/index.d.ts` exports `.prisma/client`:

```ts
export * from '.prisma/client'
```

This means that you still import `@prisma/client` in your own `.ts` files:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
```

Prisma Client is generated from your Prisma schema and is unique to your project. Each time you change the schema (for example, by performing a [schema migration](/orm/prisma-migrate)) and run `prisma generate`, Prisma Client's code changes:

The `.prisma` folder is unaffected by [pruning](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/prune.html) in Node.js package managers.

## The location of Prisma Client

:::danger

We strongly recommend you define an output path. In Prisma ORM 6.6, not defining an output path will result in a warning. In Prisma ORM 7, the field will be required.

:::

### Using a custom `output` path

You can also specify a custom `output` path on the `generator` configuration, for example (assuming your `schema.prisma` file is located at the default `prisma` subfolder):

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "../src/generated/client"
}
```

After running `prisma generate` for that schema file, the Prisma Client package will be located in:

```
./src/generated/client
```

To import the `PrismaClient` from a custom location (for example, from a file named `./src/script.ts`):

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/client'
```
