While Prisma ORM aims to make all your database queries intuitive, type-safe, and convenient, there may be situations where you need to drop down to raw queries.

This may happen for several reasons, e.g., because you need to optimize the performance of a specific query or because your data requirements can't be expressed by Prisma Client's query API.

In that case, you can use one of Prisma Client's escape hatches, such as `$queryRaw` or `$executeRaw`, to send raw queries to the database.

When using relational databases, you can use **community tools** that can still vastly improve the developer experience writing raw SQL, e.g., by enabling type safety or providing auto-completion for your SQL queries:

- [`prisma-extension-kysely`](https://github.com/eoin-obrien/prisma-extension-kysely): A Client extension that uses the [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) SQL query builder API to compose SQL queries in TypeScript, with auto-completion and type safety, and submits them through Prisma Client's connection pool.
- [SafeQL](https://safeql.dev/compatibility/prisma.html): An ESLint plugin enabling syntax highlighting and type safety for SQL strings inside Prisma ORM's raw SQL escape hatches. For a tutorial on using SafeQL, visit this [page](/orm/prisma-client/queries/raw-database-access/custom-and-type-safe-queries).
