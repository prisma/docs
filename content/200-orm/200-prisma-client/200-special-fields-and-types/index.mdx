This section covers various special fields and types you can use with Prisma Client.

</TopBlock>

## Working with <inlinecode>Decimal</inlinecode>

`Decimal` fields are represented by the [`Decimal.js` library](https://mikemcl.github.io/decimal.js/). The following example demonstrates how to import and use `Prisma.Decimal`:

```ts
import { PrismaClient, Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const newTypes = await prisma.sample.create({
  data: {
    cost: new Prisma.Decimal(24.454545),
  },
})
```

The use of the `Decimal` field [is not currently supported in MongoDB](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/12637).

## Working with <inlinecode>BigInt</inlinecode>

`BigInt` fields are represented by the [`BigInt` type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) (Node.js 10.4.0+ required). The following example demonstrates how to use the `BigInt` type:

```ts
import { PrismaClient, Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const newTypes = await prisma.sample.create({
  data: {
    revenue: BigInt(534543543534),
  },
})
```

### Serializing BigInt

Prisma returns records as plain JavaScript objects. If you attempt to use `JSON.stringify` on an object that includes a `BigInt` field, you will see the following error:

```
Do not know how to serialize a BigInt
```

To work around this issue, use a customized implementation of `JSON.stringify`:

```js
JSON.stringify(
  this,
  (key, value) => (typeof value === 'bigint' ? value.toString() : value) // return everything else unchanged
)
```

## Working with <inlinecode>Bytes</inlinecode>

`Bytes` fields are represented by the [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) type. The following example demonstrates how to use the `Buffer` type:

```ts
import { PrismaClient, Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const newTypes = await prisma.sample.create({
  data: {
    myField: Buffer.from([1, 2, 3, 4]),
  },
})
```
