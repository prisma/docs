Prisma Client extensions are Generally Available from versions 4.16.0 and later. They were introduced in Preview in version 4.7.0. Make sure you enable the `clientExtensions` Preview feature flag if you are running on a version earlier than 4.16.0.

You can use the `query` [Prisma Client extensions](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions) component type to hook into the query life-cycle and modify an incoming query or its result.

You can use Prisma Client extensions `query` component to create independent clients. This provides an alternative to [middlewares](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions/middleware). You can bind one client to a specific filter or user, and another client to another filter or user. For example, you might do this to get [user isolation](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions#extended-clients) in a row-level security (RLS) extension. In addition, unlike middlewares the `query` extension component gives you end-to-end type safety. [Learn more about `query` extensions versus middlewares](#query-extensions-versus-middlewares).

## Extend Prisma Client query operations

Use the `$extends` [client-level method](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods) to create an [extended client](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions#about-prisma-client-extensions). An extended client is a variant of the standard Prisma Client that is wrapped by one or more extensions.

Use the `query` extension component to modify queries. You can modify a custom query in the following:

- [A specific operation in a specific model](#modify-a-specific-operation-in-a-specific-model)
- [A specific operation in all models of your schema](#modify-a-specific-operation-in-all-models-of-your-schema)
- [All Prisma Client operations](#modify-all-prisma-client-operations)
- [All operations in a specific model](#modify-all-operations-in-a-specific-model)
- [All operations in all models of your schema](#modify-all-operations-in-all-models-of-your-schema)
- [A specific top-level raw query operation](#modify-a-top-level-raw-query-operation)

To create a custom query, use the following structure:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  name?: 'name',
  query?: {
    user: { ... } // in this case, we add a query to the `user` model
  },
});
```

The properties are as follows:

- `name`: (optional) specifies a name for the extension that appears in error logs.
- `query`: defines a custom query.

### Modify a specific operation in a specific model

The `query` object can contain functions that map to the names of the [Prisma Client operations](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#model-queries), such as `findUnique`, `findFirst`, `findMany`, `count`, and `create`. The following example modifies `user.findMany` to a use a customized query that finds only users who are older than 18 years:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      async findMany({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        // take incoming `where` and set `age`
        args.where = { ...args.where, age: { gt: 18 } }

        return query(args)
      },
    },
  },
})

await prisma.user.findMany() // returns users whose age is greater than 18
```

In the above example, a call to `prisma.user.findMany` triggers `query.user.findMany`. Each callback receives a type-safe `{ model, operation, args, query }` object that describes the query. This object has the following properties:

- `model`: the name of the containing model for the query that we want to extend.

  In the above example, the `model` is a string of type `"User"`.

- `operation`: the name of the operation being extended and executed.

  In the above example, the `operation` is a string of type `"findMany"`.

- `args`: the specific query input information to be extended.

  This is a type-safe object that you can mutate before the query happens. You can mutate any of the properties in `args`. Exception: you cannot mutate `include` or `select` because that would change the expected output type and break type safety.

- `query`: a promise for the result of the query.

  - You can use `await` and then mutate the result of this promise, because its value is type-safe. TypeScript catches any unsafe mutations on the object.

### Modify a specific operation in all models of your schema

To extend the queries in all the models of your schema, use `$allModels` instead of a specific model name. For example:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    $allModels: {
      async findMany({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        // set `take` and fill with the rest of `args`
        args = { take: 100, ...args }

        return query(args)
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Modify all operations in a specific model

Use `$allOperations` to extend all operations in a specific model.

For example, the following code applies a custom query to all operations on the `user` model:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      $allOperations({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        /* your custom logic here */
        return query(args)
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Modify all Prisma Client operations

Use the `$allOperations` method to modify all query methods present in Prisma Client. The `$allOperations` can be used on both model operations and raw queries.

You can modify all methods as follows:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    $allOperations({ model, operation, args, query }) {
      /* your custom logic for modifying all Prisma Client operations here */
      return query(args)
    },
  },
})
```

In the event a [raw query](/orm/prisma-client/queries/raw-database-access/raw-queries) is invoked, the `model` argument passed to the callback will be `undefined`.

For example, you can use the `$allOperations` method to log queries as follows:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    async $allOperations({ operation, model, args, query }) {
      const start = performance.now()
      const result = await query(args)
      const end = performance.now()
      const time = end - start
      console.log(
        util.inspect(
          { model, operation, args, time },
          { showHidden: false, depth: null, colors: true }
        )
      )
      return result
    },
  },
})
```

### Modify all operations in all models of your schema

Use `$allModels` and `$allOperations` to extend all operations in all models of your schema.

To apply a custom query to all operations on all models of your schema:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    $allModels: {
      $allOperations({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        /* your custom logic for modifying all operations on all models here */
        return query(args)
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Modify a top-level raw query operation

To apply custom behavior to a specific top-level raw query operation, use the name of a top-level raw query function instead of a model name:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Relational databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```ts copy
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    $queryRaw({ args, query, operation }) {
      // handle $queryRaw operation
      return query(args)
    },
    $executeRaw({ args, query, operation }) {
      // handle $executeRaw operation
      return query(args)
    },
    $queryRawUnsafe({ args, query, operation }) {
      // handle $queryRawUnsafe operation
      return query(args)
    },
    $executeRawUnsafe({ args, query, operation }) {
      // handle $executeRawUnsafe operation
      return query(args)
    },
  },
})
```

</tab>
<tab>

```ts copy
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    $runCommandRaw({ args, query, operation }) {
      // handle $runCommandRaw operation
      return query(args)
    },
  },
})
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

### Mutate the result of a query

You can use `await` and then mutate the result of the `query` promise.

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      async findFirst({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        const user = await query(args)

        if (user.password !== undefined) {
          user.password = '******'
        }

        return user
      },
    },
  },
})
```

<Admonition type="info">

We include the above example to show that this is possible. However, for performance reasons we recommend that you use the [`result` component type](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions/result) to override existing fields. The `result` component type usually gives better performance in this situation because it computes only on access. The `query` component type computes after query execution.

</Admonition>

## Wrap a query into a batch transaction

You can wrap your extended queries into a [batch transaction](/orm/prisma-client/queries/transactions). For example, you can use this to enact row-level security (RLS).

The following example extends `findFirst` so that it runs in a batch transaction.

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      // Get the input `args` and a callback to `query`
      async findFirst({ args, query, operation }) {
        const [result] = await prisma.$transaction([query(args)]) // wrap the query in a batch transaction, and destructure the result to return an array
        return result // return the first result found in the array
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## Query extensions versus middlewares

You can use query extensions or [middlewares](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions/middleware) to hook into the query life-cycle and modify an incoming query or its result. Client extensions and middlewares differ in the following ways:

- Middlewares always apply globally to the same client. Client extensions are isolated, unless you deliberately combine them. [Learn more about client extensions](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions#about-prisma-client-extensions).
  - For example, in a row-level security (RLS) scenario, you can keep each user in an entirely separate client. With middlewares, all users are active in the same client.
- During application execution, with extensions you can choose from one or more extended clients, or the standard Prisma Client. With middlewares, you cannot choose which client to use, because there is only one global client.
- Extensions benefit from end-to-end type safety and inference, but middlewares don't.

You can use Prisma Client extensions in all scenarios where middlewares can be used.

### If you use the <inlinecode>query</inlinecode> extension component and middlewares

If you use the `query` extension component and middlewares in your project, then the following rules and priorities apply:

- In your application code, you must declare all your middlewares on the main Prisma Client instance. You cannot declare them on an extended client.
- In situations where middlewares and extensions with a `query` component execute, Prisma Client executes the middlewares before it executes the extensions with the `query` component. Prisma Client executes the individual middlewares and extensions in the order in which you instantiated them with `$use` or `$extends`.
