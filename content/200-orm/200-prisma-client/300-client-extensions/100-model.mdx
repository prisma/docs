Prisma Client extensions are Generally Available from versions 4.16.0 and later. They were introduced in Preview in version 4.7.0. Make sure you enable the `clientExtensions` Preview feature flag if you are running on a version earlier than 4.16.0.

</Admonition>

You can use the `model` [Prisma Client extensions](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions) component type to add custom methods to your models.

Possible uses for the `model` component include the following:

- New operations to operate alongside existing Prisma Client operations, such as `findMany`
- Encapsulated business logic
- Repetitive operations
- Model-specific utilities

</TopBlock>

## Add a custom method

Use the `$extends` [client-level method](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods) to create an _extended client_. An extended client is a variant of the standard Prisma Client that is wrapped by one or more extensions. Use the `model` extension component to add methods to models in your schema.

### Add a custom method to a specific model

To extend a specific model in your schema, use the following structure. This example adds a method to the `user` model.

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  name?: '<name>',  // (optional) names the extension for error logs
  model?: {
    user: { ... }   // in this case, we extend the `user` model
  },
});
```

#### Example

The following example adds a method called `signUp` to the `user` model. This method creates a new user with the specified email address.

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  model: {
    user: {
      async signUp(email: string) {
        await prisma.user.create({ data: { email } })
      },
    },
  },
})
```

You would call `signUp` in your application as follows:

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.signUp('john@prisma.io')
```

When you call a method in an extension, use the constant name from your `$extends` statement, not `prisma`. In the above example, `prisma.user.signUp` works, but `prisma.user.signUp` does not, because the original `prisma` is not modified.

### Add a custom method to all models in your schema

To extend _all_ models in your schema, use the following structure:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  name?: '<name>', // `name` is an optional field that you can use to name the extension for error logs
  model?: {
    $allModels: { ... }
  },
})
```

#### Example

The following example adds an `exists` method to all models.

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  model: {
    $allModels: {
      async exists<T>(
        this: T,
        where: Prisma.Args<T, 'findFirst'>['where']
      ): Promise<boolean> {
        // Get the current model at runtime
        const context = Prisma.getExtensionContext(this)

        const result = await (context as any).findFirst({ where })
        return result !== null
      },
    },
  },
})
```

You would call `exists` in your application as follows:

```ts
// `exists` method available on all models
await prisma.user.exists({ name: 'Alice' })
await prisma.post.exists({
  OR: [{ title: { contains: 'Prisma' } }, { content: { contains: 'Prisma' } }],
})
```

## Call a custom method from another custom method

You can call a custom method from another custom method, if the two methods are declared on the same model. For example, you can call a custom method on the `user` model from another custom method on the `user` model. It does not matter if the two methods are declared in the same extension or in different extensions.

To do so, use `Prisma.getExtensionContext(this).methodName`. Note that you cannot use `prisma.user.methodName`. This is because `prisma` is not extended yet, and therefore does not contain the new method.

For example:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  model: {
    user: {
      firstMethod() {
        ...
      },
      secondMethod() {
          Prisma.getExtensionContext(this).firstMethod()
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Get the current model name at runtime

<Admonition type = "info">

This feature is available from version 4.9.0.

</Admonition>

You can get the name of the current model at runtime with `Prisma.getExtensionContext(this).name`. You might use this to write out the model name to a log, to send the name to another service, or to branch your code based on the model.

For example:

```ts
// `context` refers to the current model
const context = Prisma.getExtensionContext(this)

// `context.name` returns the name of the current model
console.log(context.name)

// Usage
await(context as any).findFirst({ args })
```

Refer to [Add a custom method to all models in your schema](#example-1) for a concrete example for retrieving the current model name at runtime.

## Advanced type safety: type utilities for defining generic extensions

You can improve the type-safety of `model` components in your shared extensions with [type utilities](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions/type-utilities).
