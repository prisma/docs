## Prisma Client error types

Prisma Client throws different kinds of errors. The following lists the exception types, and their documented data fields:

### `PrismaClientKnownRequestError`

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` exception if the query engine returns a known error related to the request - for example, a unique constraint violation.

| **Property**    | **Description**                                                                                                  |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`          | A Prisma-specific [error code](#error-codes).                                                                    |
| `meta`          | Additional information about the error - for example, the field that caused the error: `{ target: [ 'email' ] }` |
| `message`       | Error message associated with [error code](#error-codes).                                                        |
| `clientVersion` | Version of Prisma Client (for example, `2.19.0`)                                                                 |

### `PrismaClientUnknownRequestError`

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientUnknownRequestError` exception if the query engine returns an error related to a request that does not have an error code.

| **Property**    | **Description**                                           |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`       | Error message associated with [error code](#error-codes). |
| `clientVersion` | Version of Prisma Client (for example, `2.19.0`)          |

### `PrismaClientRustPanicError`

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientRustPanicError` exception if the underlying engine crashes and exits with a non-zero exit code. In this case, Prisma Client or the whole Node process must be restarted.

| **Property**    | **Description**                                           |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`       | Error message associated with [error code](#error-codes). |
| `clientVersion` | Version of Prisma Client (for example, `2.19.0`)          |

### `PrismaClientInitializationError`

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientInitializationError` exception if something goes wrong when the query engine is started and the connection to the database is created. This happens either:

- When `prisma.$connect()` is called OR
- When the first query is executed

Errors that can occur include:

- The provided credentials for the database are invalid
- There is no database server running under the provided hostname and port
- The port that the query engine HTTP server wants to bind to is already taken
- A missing or inaccessible environment variable
- The query engine binary for the current platform could not be found (`generator` block)

| **Property**    | **Description**                                           |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `errorCode`     | A Prisma-specific error code.                             |
| `message`       | Error message associated with [error code](#error-codes). |
| `clientVersion` | Version of Prisma Client (for example, `2.19.0`)          |

### `PrismaClientValidationError`

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientValidationError` exception if validation fails - for example:

- Missing field - for example, an empty `data: {}` property when creating a new record
- Incorrect field type provided (for example, setting a `Boolean` field to `"Hello, I like cheese and gold!"`)

| **Property**    | **Description**                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `message`       | Error message.                                   |
| `clientVersion` | Version of Prisma Client (for example, `2.19.0`) |

## Error codes

### Common

#### `P1002`

"The database server at `{database_host}`:`{database_port}` was reached but timed out. Please try again. Please make sure your database server is running at `{database_host}`:`{database_port}`. "

#### `P1003`

"Database \{database_file_name} does not exist at \{database_file_path}"

"Database `{database_name}.{database_schema_name}` does not exist on the database server at `{database_host}:{database_port}`."

"Database `{database_name}` does not exist on the database server at `{database_host}:{database_port}`."

A schema that was valid before version 4.0.0 might be invalid in version 4.0.0 and later. The upgrade guide explains how to update your schema to make it valid.

### Prisma Accelerate

Prisma Accelerate-related errors start with `P6xxx`.

#### `P6000` (`ServerError`)

Generic error to catch all other errors.

#### `P6001` (`InvalidDataSource`)

The URL is malformed; for instance, it does not use the `prisma://` protocol.

#### `P6002` (`Unauthorized`)

The API Key in the connection string is invalid.

#### `P6003` (`PlanLimitReached`)

The included usage of the current plan has been exceeded. This can only occur on the [free plan](https://www.prisma.io/pricing).

#### `P6004` (`QueryTimeout`)

The global timeout of Accelerate has been exceeded. You can find the limit [here](/accelerate/limitations#query-timeout-limit).

#### `P6005` (`InvalidParameters`)

The user supplied invalid parameters. Currently only relevant for transaction methods. For example, setting a timeout that is too high. You can find the limit [here](/accelerate/limitations#interactive-transactions-query-timeout-limit).

#### `P6006` (`VersionNotSupported`)

The chosen Prisma version is not compatible with Accelerate. This may occur when a user uses an unstable development version that we occasionally prune.

#### `P6008` (`ConnectionError|EngineStartError`)

The engine failed to start. For example, it couldn't establish a connection to the database.

#### `P6009` (`ResponseSizeLimitExceeded`)

The global response size limit of Accelerate has been exceeded. You can find the limit [here](/accelerate/limitations#response-size-limit).
