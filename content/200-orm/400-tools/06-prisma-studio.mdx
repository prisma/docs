Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database. Note that Prisma Studio is not open source but you can still create issues in the [`prisma/studio`](https://github.com/prisma/studio) repo.

Run `npx prisma studio` in your terminal.

## Models (tables or collections)

When you first open Prisma Studio, you will see a data table layout with a sidebar showing a list of all models defined in your Prisma schema file.

<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/01-models-view.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - Models view"
  width="650px"
/>

<Admonition>

**What is a model?**<br /><br />

The term **model** refers to the data model definitions that you add to the Prisma schema file. Depending on the database that you use, a model definition, such as `model User`, refers to a **table** in a relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, CockroachDB) or a **collection** in MongoDB.<br /><br />
For more information, see [Defining models](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models#defining-models).

</Admonition>

You can select a model and its data opens in a new tab. In this example, the `User` model is selected.

<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/02-open-model.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - Models view with model open"
  width="650px"
/>


### Open and close models

To open another model, locate the model in the sidebar and click on it.

To close a model, click the the **X** button in the model tab. If there are multiple models open, you can also click "Close all" to close all models.

<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/03-open-close-models.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - Open and close models"
  width="650px"
/>

### Icons of data types in models

The data type for each field is indicated with an icon in the header.

The table below lists all data types and their identifying icon.

| Field data type | Description |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------ |
|   <StudioStringSvg width="10px" alt="String type" className="table-icon"/>   | Text                                                                                                        |
|   <StudioNumberSvg width="10px" alt="Number type" className="table-icon"/>   | Integer                                                                                                     |
| <StudioDatetimeSvg width="10px" alt="Datetime type" className="table-icon"/> | Date-time<br /><br />                                                                                       |
|  <StudioBooleanSvg width="10px" alt="Boolean type" className="table-icon"/>  | Boolean<br />                                                                                               |
|     <StudioEnumSvg width="10px" alt="Enum type" className="table-icon"/>     | Pre-defined list of values (`enum` data type)                                                               |
|    <StudioArraySvg width="10px" alt="Array type" className="table-icon"/>    | List of related records from another model                                                                  |
|   <StudioObjectSvg width="10px" alt="Object type" className="table-icon"/>   | The `{}` symbol can refer to one of the two types of fields.<br /><br /> • Relation field<br />• JSON field |

### Keyboard shortcuts in models

When you open a model, a number of keyboard shortcuts are available to browse and manipulate the data in the model.

<Admonition>

**Note**<br /><br />
With Prisma Studio open, you can open the keyboard shortcuts modal by pressing <kbd>Cmd &#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> on Windows.

</Admonition>

## Edit data

Prisma Studio offers two mechanisms for editing existing data: [in-line editing](#in-line-editing) and [side panel editing](#side-panel-editing).

### In-line editing

To edit data in-line, double-click a cell to enter edit mode. Doing so will place your cursor in the cell and allow you to edit the data. Data can be copied and pasted into cells. 

All changes (add, edit, or delete) must be confirmed before they will take effect. Confirm added and edited records with the **Save change** button. When you select records and click **Delete records**, confirm the deletion in a dialog box.

You can accumulate multiple added records and edited cells, which you can then finalize with the **Save changes** button.

<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/10-edit-inline-record.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - In-line editing"
  width="650px"
/>

Once you have finished editing the data, click the green **Save** button.

<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/11-save-inline-changes.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - Save inline changes"
  width="650px"
/>

### Batch editing

Multiple records can be edited at once. Double click any cell to edit values, moving to any additional cells as necessary. Once complete, click the green **Save** button.

<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/12-save-multiple-inline-changes.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - Save multiple inline changes"
  width="650px"
/>

### Side panel editing

Prisma Studio also offers a side panel for editing data. To open the side panel, click the **Edit side panel** icon located beside the select checkbox at the far left of every visible record.

<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/13-edit-side-panel-icon.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - Open side panel"
  width="650px"
/>

Clicking the icon will open the side panel on the right where edits can be performed. Once complete, click outside the side panel and click the green **Save** button to save the changes.

<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/14-edit-data-in-sidepanel.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - Edit side panel"
  width="650px"
/>

### Delete records

1. From the left column, select the check box for the records you want to delete.
2. Click **Delete _n_ record(s)**.
3. Click **Delete** in the confirmation dialog.

You can select multiple records and delete them at once with the **Delete records** button. When you delete multiple records, the operation completes immediately (after you confirm it).

In addition, if you have any accumulated added or edited records and then decide to delete records, the deletion also force-saves the accumulated edits.

<Admonition type="warning">

**Warning**<br /><br />
Deleting a record is a separate operation that cannot be accumulated. If you delete a record while having unsaved edits, the delete operation first force-saves the unsaved edits and then completes.

</Admonition>


<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/15-delete-records.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - Delete records"
  width="650px"
/>

You can discard any accumulated changes with the **Discard changes** button.

<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/16-discard-changes.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - Discard changes"
  width="650px"
/>

### Copy and paste

You can copy the value of any table cell using:

- <kbd>Cmd &#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on macOS
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Windows

To paste in another cell, first double-click the cell to enter edit mode, and then use:

- <kbd>Cmd &#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on macOS
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Windows

### Add a record

1. In the model view, click **Add record**.
2. Based on the data allowed in each field, type the data for the record.

   |                                  Field data type                                  | Description        |
   | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------ |
   |   <StudioStringSvg width="10px" alt="String type" className="table-icon"/>   | Text               |
   |   <StudioNumberSvg width="10px" alt="Number type" className="table-icon"/>   | Integer<br /><br />If such a field has `autoincrement()` pre-filled, do not edit the cell and do not add a number manually.                                                                        |
   | <StudioDatetimeSvg width="10px" alt="Datetime type" className="table-icon"/> | Date-time<br /><br />Date-time fields contain a long string of numbers, letters, and others. As a best practice, copy the value of another date-time cell and modify it as necessary before pasting in the field.                                                                                                                                                                        |
   |  <StudioBooleanSvg width="10px" alt="Boolean type" className="table-icon"/>  | Boolean<br /><br />Select `true` or `false`.                  |
   |     <StudioEnumSvg width="10px" alt="Enum type" className="table-icon"/>     | Pre-defined list<br /><br />Double-click a cell in the field and select one of the pre-defined options. |
   |    <StudioArraySvg width="10px" alt="Array type" className="table-icon"/>    | List of related records from another model<br /><br />It typically refers to a list of records that exist in another model in the database. If you are adding a new record and records from the related model do not yet exist, you do not need to enter anything in the current model. |
   |   <StudioObjectSvg width="10px" alt="Object type" className="table-icon"/>   | The `{}` symbol can refer to one of the two types of fields.<br /><br /> • Relation field<br />• JSON field<br /><br />**Relation with a model defined separately in the database**<br /><br />Typically, you need to select the same value as any of the previous records<br />Click the name of the model to see the list of values which you can then select for the related field.<br /><br />**JSON field**<br /><br /> Double-click the field to edit the JSON data. As a best practice, validate the edited JSON data in a validator and paste it back in the cell. |

3. (Optional) If you are unhappy with your changes, click **Discard changes** and start over.
4. Click **Save 1 change**.

## Filters

### Filter data

Use the **Filters** menu to filter data in the model by adding conditions.

In the **Filters** menu, the first condition that you add is the `where` clause.

When you add multiple conditions, Prisma Studio filters the results so that all conditions apply in combination. Each new condition indicates this with the `and` operator, which appears in front.

**Steps**

1. Click **Filters** to open the **Filters** menu.

   <Admonition>

   **Note**<br />
   Click **Filters** again if you want to hide the menu.

   </Admonition>

2. Click **Add a new filter**.
3. Configure the condition.
   1. Select the field by which you want to filter.
   2. Select a comparison operator.
      - **equals**
      - **in**
      - **notin**
      - **lt**
      - **lte**
      - **gt**
      - **gte**
      - **not**
   3. Type the value you want to use for the condition.<br />
      **Step result**: **Prisma Studio** updates the data in the model immediately, based on the condition.
4. To add a new filter, click **Add a new filter** and repeat the steps above.
5. To remove a filter, click the **x** button on the right.
   <img
     src={require("./images/prisma-studio/06-add-remove-filters.png").default}
     alt="Prisma Studio - add and remove filters"
     width="650px"
   />
6. To remove all filters, click **Clear all**.

**Result**

- The data in the model is filtered based on the combination of all conditions you add.
- In the **Filters** menu, the default value of **None** changes to display the number of filters you add.

### Show and hide fields

You can select which fields to view or hide by using the **Fields** menu.

<Admonition>

**What is a field?**<br />

A **field** is a property of a model which you add in the data model definitions in the Prisma schema file. Depending on the database that you use, a field, such as the `title` field in `model User { title String }`, refers to a **column** in a relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, CockroachDB) or a **document field** in MongoDB.<br />
For more information, see [Defining fields](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models#defining-fields).

</Admonition>

**Steps**

1. Click the **Fields** menu.
2. Select only the fields you want to see and deselect any fields you want to hide.
   <img
     src={require("./images/prisma-studio/07-show-hide-fields.png").default}
     width="400px"
     alt="Prisma Studio - show and hide fields"
   />

**Result**

The model is immediately filtered to hide the data from any fields you have deselected.

Also, the **Fields** menu shows the number of fields that are currently selected.

### Show and hide records

You can also select to show or skip a specific number of records in the model view.

<Admonition>

**What is a record?**<br />

A **record** refers to a **row of data in a table** in a relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, CockroachDB) or a **document** in MongoDB.

</Admonition>

**Steps**

1. Click the **Showing** menu.
2. In the **Take** box, specify the maximum number of records that you want the model view to show.
3. In the **Skip** box, specify how many of the first records you want to hide.
   <img
     src={require("./images/prisma-studio/08-show-hide-records.png").default}
     width="450px"
     alt="Prisma Studio - Show and hide records"
   />

**Result**

The model is immediately filtered to show or hide records based on your selection.

The **Showing** menu indicates how many records are shown out of how many available records are in the model.

## Sort data

Click a field title to sort by the field data.

The first click sorts the data in ascending order, the second - in descending order.

<img
  src={require("./images/prisma-studio/09-model-sort.png").default}
  alt="Prisma Studio - Sort data"
  width="650px"
/>

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal: Failed to run script / Error in Prisma Client request

Caching issues may cause Prisma Studio to use an older version of the query engine. You may see the following error:

```terminal wrap
Error in request:  PrismaClientKnownRequestError: Failed to validate the query Error occurred during query validation & transformation
```

To resolve, delete the following folders:

- `~/.cache/prisma` on macOS and Linux
- `%AppData%/Prisma/Studio` on Windows
