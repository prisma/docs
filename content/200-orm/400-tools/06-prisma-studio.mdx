Prisma Studio is a visual editor for your database that lets you view and manipulate data directly in your browser. Prisma ORM v7 introduces a more stable version of Prisma Studio with improved performance and a modernized architecture.

Note that Prisma Studio is not open source but you can still create issues in the [`prisma/studio`](https://github.com/prisma/studio) repo.

## Prerequisites

Before using Prisma Studio, you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v20.19+, v22.12+, or v24.0+ installed on your machine
- A Prisma project with:
  - A `prisma/schema.prisma` file with at least one model defined
  - A `prisma.config.ts` configuration file
  - A configured database connection

## Getting started

To launch Prisma Studio, run the following command in your project directory:

```terminal
npx prisma studio --config ./prisma.config.ts
```

This starts a local web server (default port `5555`) and opens Prisma Studio in your browser. Studio reads your Prisma config and connects to your database using the connection string from your configuration.

## Core features

Prisma Studio provides several key capabilities for working with your database:

### Browse your data

Studio displays all models from your Prisma schema in a sidebar. Select any model to view its data in a table format. You can open multiple models in separate tabs to work with related data simultaneously.

### View and edit records

You can edit data in two ways:

- **Inline editing**: Double-click any cell to edit its value directly in the table
- **Side panel editing**: Click the edit icon next to a record to open a detailed view with all fields

Changes are accumulated and must be saved explicitly using the save button. This lets you make multiple edits before committing them to the database.

### Add new records

Create new records by clicking the "Add record" button. Studio provides appropriate input controls based on each field's data type:

- Text fields for strings
- Number inputs for integers and decimals
- Date pickers for datetime fields
- Dropdowns for enums and boolean values
- Relation selectors for foreign keys

### Delete records

Select one or more records using the checkboxes and click the delete button. Deletions require confirmation and are applied immediately (they cannot be batched with other changes).

### Filter and search

Use the Filters menu to narrow down your data:

- Add conditions using comparison operators (equals, greater than, less than, etc.)
- Combine multiple filters with AND logic
- Clear individual filters or all filters at once

### Control visibility

Customize your view:

- **Fields menu**: Show or hide specific columns
- **Showing menu**: Control pagination with "Take" (limit) and "Skip" (offset) options

### Sort data

Click any column header to sort by that field. Click again to toggle between ascending and descending order.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Studio supports keyboard shortcuts for common operations. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> (Windows) to view all available shortcuts.

## Understanding data types

Studio displays visual indicators for different field types in your schema:

- **Text fields**: String values
- **Number fields**: Integers and decimals
- **Date/time fields**: Timestamps and dates
- **Boolean fields**: True/false values
- **Enum fields**: Predefined list of options
- **Relation fields**: References to records in other models
- **JSON fields**: Structured JSON data

These visual cues help you quickly understand your data structure without referring back to your schema file.

## Working with relations

When your models have relationships defined in your Prisma schema, Studio provides tools to navigate and edit related data:

- Click on a relation field to view the related record
- Use relation selectors when creating or editing records to link to existing data
- Open related models in separate tabs to work with connected data simultaneously

## Data integrity

Studio respects your schema constraints:

- Required fields must be filled before saving
- Unique constraints are validated
- Foreign key relationships are maintained
- Default values are automatically applied
- Auto-increment fields are handled automatically

If you attempt an operation that would violate a constraint, Studio will display an error message explaining the issue.

## Databases supported by Prisma Studio

Prisma Studio currently supports the following databases:

- PostgreSQL: Full support for all PostgreSQL features
- MySQL: Full support for all MySQL features  
- SQLite: Full support (see requirements below)

### SQLite requirements for Prisma Studio

- Node.js 22.5+: Works out of the box with the built-in `node:sqlite` module
- Node.js 20: Requires installing `better-sqlite3` as a dependency
  - If using pnpm 10+, you'll also need to allow the `better-sqlite3` install script

### Databases not yet supported

Support for CockroachDB and MongoDB is not currently available but may be added in future releases. If you're using these databases:

- CockroachDB: Explore the options suggested by [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-gui-options/)
- MongoDB: Use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), MongoDB Compass, or the MongoDB shell

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal: Failed to run script / Error in Prisma Client request

Caching issues may cause Prisma Studio to use an older version of the query engine. You may see the following error:

```terminal wrap
Error in request:  PrismaClientKnownRequestError: Failed to validate the query Error occurred during query validation & transformation
```

To resolve, delete the following folders:

- `~/.cache/prisma` on macOS and Linux
- `%AppData%/Prisma/Studio` on Windows
