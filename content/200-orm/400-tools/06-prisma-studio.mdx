Prisma Studio is a standalone visual database editor that lets you view and manipulate data directly in your browser. Unlike previous versions, Prisma Studio is now SQL-driven and works independently of Prisma ORM—you can use it with any database without needing a Prisma schema or project.

Note that Prisma Studio is not open source but you can still create issues in the [`prisma/studio`](https://github.com/prisma/studio) repo.

## Prerequisites

Prisma Studio is a standalone tool that only requires a database connection. You have two options:

### Option 1: Use with any database (no Prisma project required)

Connect directly to any supported database using the `--url` flag:

```terminal
npx prisma studio --url="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
```

This approach works without any Prisma ORM setup—Studio will introspect your database schema directly.

### Option 2: Use with a Prisma ORM project

If you have an existing Prisma project, Studio can read your configuration:

- A `prisma/schema.prisma` file with at least one model defined
- A `prisma.config.ts` configuration file
- A configured database connection

## Getting started

### Standalone usage (without Prisma ORM)

To launch Prisma Studio with any database, provide a connection URL:

```terminal
npx prisma studio --url="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
```

### With a Prisma ORM project

If you have a Prisma project, run the following command in your project directory:

```terminal
npx prisma studio --config ./prisma.config.ts
```

Both commands start a local web server (default port `5555`) and open Prisma Studio in your browser. Studio connects to your database and introspects the schema to provide a visual interface for your data.

## Core features

Prisma Studio provides several key capabilities for working with your database:

### Browse your data

Studio displays all tables from your database in a sidebar. Select any table to view its data in a table format. You can open multiple tables in separate tabs to work with related data simultaneously.

### View and edit records

You can edit data in two ways:

- **Inline editing**: Double-click any cell to edit its value directly in the table
- **Side panel editing**: Click the edit icon next to a record to open a detailed view with all fields

Changes are accumulated and must be saved explicitly using the save button. This lets you make multiple edits before committing them to the database.

### Add new records

Create new records by clicking the "Add record" button. Studio provides appropriate input controls based on each field's data type:

- Text fields for strings
- Number inputs for integers and decimals
- Date pickers for datetime fields
- Dropdowns for enums and boolean values
- Relation selectors for foreign keys

### Delete records

Select one or more records using the checkboxes and click the delete button. Deletions require confirmation and are applied immediately (they cannot be batched with other changes).

### Filter and search

Use the Filters menu to narrow down your data:

- Add conditions using comparison operators (equals, greater than, less than, etc.)
- Combine multiple filters with AND logic
- Clear individual filters or all filters at once

### Control visibility

Customize your view:

- **Fields menu**: Show or hide specific columns
- **Showing menu**: Control pagination with "Take" (limit) and "Skip" (offset) options

### Sort data

Click any column header to sort by that field. Click again to toggle between ascending and descending order.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Studio supports keyboard shortcuts for common operations. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> (Windows) to view all available shortcuts.

## Understanding data types

Studio displays visual indicators for different field types in your database:

- **Text fields**: String values
- **Number fields**: Integers and decimals
- **Date/time fields**: Timestamps and dates
- **Boolean fields**: True/false values
- **Enum fields**: Predefined list of options
- **Relation fields**: References to records in other tables (foreign keys)
- **JSON fields**: Structured JSON data

These visual cues help you quickly understand your data structure as Studio introspects it directly from your database.

## Working with relations

When your database tables have foreign key relationships, Studio provides tools to navigate and edit related data:

- Click on a relation field to view the related record
- Use relation selectors when creating or editing records to link to existing data
- Open related tables in separate tabs to work with connected data simultaneously

## Databases supported by Prisma Studio

Prisma Studio currently supports the following databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

### SQLite requirements for Prisma Studio

- File paths must have a `file:` protocol right now in the database url for SQLite
- **Node.js 22.5+**: Works out of the box with the built-in `node:sqlite` module
  - May require `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-sqlite` environment variable
- **Node.js 20**: Requires installing `better-sqlite3` as a dependency
  - If using pnpm 10+ with `pnpx`, you'll need the [`--allow-build=better-sqlite3`](https://pnpm.io/cli/dlx#--allow-build) flag
- **Deno >= 2.2**: Supported via [built-in SQLite module](https://docs.deno.com/api/node/sqlite/)
- **Bun**: Support for Prisma Studio with SQLite is coming soon and is not available yet

:::tip[Using `npx` with `better-sqlite3`]

If you don't have `node:sqlite` available in your runtime or prefer not to install `better-sqlite3` as a hard dependency (it adds ~10MB), you can use `npx` to temporarily install the required packages:

```terminal
npx -p better-sqlite3 -p prisma prisma studio --url file:./my_file.db
```

This command:
- Temporarily installs `better-sqlite3` without adding it to your project dependencies
- Runs Prisma Studio with the specified SQLite database file
- Avoids the 10MB overhead of `better-sqlite3` in your project

### Databases not yet supported

Support for CockroachDB and MongoDB is not currently available but may be added in future releases. If you're using these databases:

- CockroachDB: Explore the options suggested by [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-gui-options/)
- MongoDB: Use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), MongoDB Compass, or the MongoDB shell

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal: Failed to run script / Error in Prisma Client request

Caching issues may cause Prisma Studio to use an older version of the query engine. You may see the following error:

```terminal wrap
Error in request:  PrismaClientKnownRequestError: Failed to validate the query Error occurred during query validation & transformation
```

To resolve, delete the following folders:

- `~/.cache/prisma` on macOS and Linux
- `%AppData%/Prisma/Studio` on Windows
