The Prisma command line interface (CLI) is the primary way to interact with your Prisma project from the command line. It can initialize new project assets, generate Prisma Client, and analyze existing database structures through introspection to automatically create your application models.

## Command reference

See [Prisma CLI command reference](/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference) for a complete list of commands.

## Installation

The Prisma CLI is typically installed locally as a **development dependency**, that's why the `--save-dev` (npm) and `--dev` (Yarn) options are used in the commands below.

### npm

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

### Yarn

Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```
yarn add prisma --dev
```

### pnpm

Install with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```
pnpm install prisma --save-dev
```

### Bun

Install with [Bun](https://bun.sh/):

```
bun add prisma
```

## Usage

If you installed Prisma as a development dependency, you need to prefix the `prisma` command with your package runner.

### npm

```
npx prisma
```

### Yarn

```
yarn prisma
```

### pnpm

```
pnpm dlx prisma
```

### Bun

```
bunx --bun prisma
```

:::note

The `--bun` flag ensures Prisma runs with the Bun runtime. Without it, Prisma falls back to Node.js due to the `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang in the CLI.

## Synopsis

The `prisma` command can be called from command line once installed. When called without arguments, it will display its command usage and help document:

<CodeWithResult expanded={true}>

<cmd>

```terminal
prisma
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy
$ npx prisma

    ◭  Prisma is a modern DB toolkit to query, migrate and model your database (https://prisma.io)

    Flags

         --preview-feature   Run Preview Prisma commands
         --help, -h          Show additional information about a command

    Examples

      Set up a new Prisma project
      $ prisma init

      Generate artifacts (e.g. Prisma Client)
      $ prisma generate

      Browse your data
      $ prisma studio

      Create migrations from your Prisma schema, apply them to the database, generate artifacts (e.g. Prisma Client)
      $ prisma migrate dev

      Pull the schema from an existing database, updating the Prisma schema
      $ prisma db pull

      Push the Prisma schema state to the database
      $ prisma db push

      Validate your Prisma schema
      $ prisma validate

      Format your Prisma schema
      $ prisma format

      Display Prisma version info
      $ prisma version

      Display Prisma debug info
      $ prisma debug
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

You can get additional help on any of the `prisma` commands by adding the `--help` flag after the command.

## Exit codes

All `prisma` CLI commands return the following codes when they exit:

- exit code 0 when a command runs successfully
- exit code 1 when a command errors
- exit code 130 when the CLI receives a signal interrupt (SIGINT) message or if the user cancels a prompt. This exit code is available in Prisma ORM versions 4.3.0 and later.

## Telemetry

The term **telemetry** refers to the collection of certain usage data to help _improve the quality of a piece of software_. Prisma uses telemetry in two contexts:

- when it collects CLI usage data
- when it submits CLI error reports

This page describes the overall telemetry approach for Prisma, what kind of data is collected and how to opt-out of data collection.

### Why does Prisma collect metrics?

Telemetry helps us better understand _how many users_ are using our products and _how often_ they are using our products. Unlike many telemetry services, our telemetry implementation is intentionally limited in scope and is actually useful for the developer:

- **Limited in scope**: We use telemetry to answer one question: how many monthly active developers are using Prisma CLI?
- **Provides value**: Our telemetry service also checks for version updates and offers security notices.

### When is data collected?

Data is collected in two scenarios that are described below.

#### Usage data

Invocations of the `prisma` CLI and general usage of Studio results in data being sent to the telemetry server at https://checkpoint.prisma.io. Note that:

- The data does **not** include your schema or the data in your database
- Prisma only sends information after you execute a CLI command

Here is an overview of the data that's being submitted:

|          Field | Attributes | Description                                                                            |
| -------------: | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      `product` |  _string_  | Name of the product (e.g. `prisma`)                                                    |
|      `version` |  _string_  | Currently installed version of the product (e.g. `1.0.0-rc0`)                          |
|         `arch` |  _string_  | Client's operating system architecture (e.g. `amd64`).                                 |
|           `os` |  _string_  | Client's operating system (e.g. `darwin`).                                             |
| `node_version` |  _string_  | Client's node version (e.g. `v12.12.0`).                                               |
|    `signature` |  _string_  | Random, non-identifiable signature UUID (e.g. `91b014df3-9dda-4a27-a8a7-15474fd899f8`) |
|   `user_agent` |  _string_  | User agent of the checkpoint client (e.g. `prisma/js-checkpoint`)                      |
|    `timestamp` |  _string_  | When the request was made in RFC3339 format (e.g. `2019-12-12T17:45:56Z`)              |

You can opt-out of this behavior by setting the `CHECKPOINT_DISABLE` environment variable to `1`, e.g.:

```terminal
export CHECKPOINT_DISABLE=1
```

#### Error reporting

Prisma potentially collects error data when there is a crash in the CLI.

Before an error report is submitted, there will _always_ be a prompt asking you to confirm or deny the submission of the error report! Error reports are never submitted without your explicit consent!

### How to opt-out of data collection?

#### Usage data

You can opt-out of usage data collection by setting the `CHECKPOINT_DISABLE` environment variable to `1`, e.g.:

```terminal
export CHECKPOINT_DISABLE=1
```

#### Error reporting

You can opt-out of data collection by responding to the interactive prompt with _no_.
