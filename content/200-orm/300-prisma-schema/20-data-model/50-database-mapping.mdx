The [Prisma schema](/orm/prisma-schema) includes mechanisms that allow you to define names of certain database objects. You can:

- [Map model and field names to different collection/table and field/column names](#mapping-collectiontable-and-fieldcolumn-names)
- [Define constraint and index names](#constraint-and-index-names)

</TopBlock>

<!-- would be nice to have a general name for this -->

## Mapping collection/table and field/column names

Sometimes the names used to describe entities in your database might not match the names you would prefer in your generated API. Mapping names in the Prisma schema allows you to influence the naming in your Client API without having to change the underlying database names.

A common approach for naming tables/collections in databases for example is to use plural form and [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) notation. Prisma on the other hand has recommended model [naming conventions (singular form, PascalCase)](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#naming-conventions) which differ from that.

`@map` and `@@map` allow you to [tune the shape of your Prisma Client API](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/custom-model-and-field-names) by decoupling model and field names from table and column names in the underlying database.

### Map collection / table names

As an example, when you [introspect](/orm/prisma-schema/introspection) a database with a table named `comments`, the resulting Prisma model will look like this:

```prisma
model comments {
  // Fields
}
```

However, you can still choose `Comment` as the name of the model (e.g. to follow the naming convention) without renaming the underlying `comments` table in the database by using the [`@@map`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#map-1) attribute:

```prisma highlight=4;normal
model Comment {
  // Fields

  @@map("comments")
}
```

With this modified model definition, Prisma automatically maps the `Comment` model to the `comments` table in the underlying database.

### Map field / column names

You can also [`@map`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#map) a column/field name:

```prisma highlight=2-4;normal
model Comment {
  content String @map("comment_text")
  email   String @map("commenter_email")
  type    Enum   @map("comment_type")

  @@map("comments")
}
```

This way the `comment_text` column is not available under `prisma.comment.comment_text` in the Prisma Client API, but can be accessed via `prisma.comment.content`.

### Map enum names and values

You can also `@map` an enum value, or `@@map` an enum:

```prisma highlight=3,5;normal
enum Type {
  Blog,
  Twitter @map("comment_twitter")

  @@map("comment_source_enum")
}
```

## Constraint and index names

In [2.29.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.29.0) and later, you can optionally use the `map` argument to define the **underlying constraint and index names** in the Prisma schema for the attributes [`@id`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#id), [`@@id`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#id-1), [`@unique`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#unique), [`@@unique`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#unique-1), [`@@index`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#index) and [`@relation`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#relation).

When introspecting a database, the `map` argument will _only_ be rendered in the schema if the name differs from Prisma's [default constraint naming convention for indexes and constraints](#prismas-default-naming-conventions-for-indexes-and-constraints).

<Admonition type="alert">

If you use Prisma Migrate in a version earlier than 2.29.0 and want to maintain your existing constraint and index names after upgrading to a newer version, **do not** immediately run `prisma migrate` or `prisma db push`. This will **change any underlying constraint name that does not follow Prisma's convention**. Follow the [upgrade path that allows you to maintain existing constraint and index names](/orm/more/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-3/named-constraints#option-1-i-want-to-maintain-my-existing-constraint-and-index-names).

### Use cases for named constraints

Some use cases for explicitly named constraints include:

- Company policy
- Conventions of other tools

#### Prisma's default naming conventions for indexes and constraints

Prisma naming convention was chosen to align with PostgreSQL since it is deterministic. It also helps to maximize the amount of times where names do not need to be rendered because many databases out there they already align with the convention.

We always use the database names of entities when generating the default names. So if a model is remapped to a different name in the data model, the default name generation will still take the name of the table in the database as input. The same is true for fields and columns.

| Entity            | Convention                        | Example                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Primary Key       | {tablename}\_pkey                 | `User_pkey`                    |
| Unique Constraint | {tablename}\_{column_names}\_key  | `User_firstName_last_Name_key` |
| Non-Unique Index  | {tablename}\_{column_names}\_idx  | `User_age_idx`                 |
| Foreign Key       | {tablename}\_{column_names}\_fkey | `User_childName_fkey`          |

Since most databases have a length limit for entity names, the names will be trimmed if necessary to not violate the database limits. We will shorten the part before the `_suffix` as necessary so that the full name is at most the maximum length permitted.

### Using default constraint names

When no explicit names are provided via `map` arguments Prisma will assume they follow the default naming convention.

If you introspect a database the names for indexes and constraints will be added to your schema unless they follow Prisma's naming convention. If they do, the names are not rendered to keep the schema more readable. When you migrate such a schema Prisma will infer the default names and persist them in the database.

#### Example

The following schema defines three constraints (`@id`, `@unique`, and `@relation`) and one index (`@@index`) that will

```prisma highlight=2,8,11,13;normal
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String @unique
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id         Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title      String
  authorName String @default("Anonymous")
  author     User?  @relation(fields: [authorName], references: [name])

  @@index([title, authorName])
}
```

Since no explicit names are provided via `map` arguments Prisma will assume they follow our default naming convention.

### Prisma's default naming conventions for indexes and constraints

If you introspect a database the names for indexes and constraints will be added to your schema unless they follow Prisma's naming convention. If they do, the names are not rendered to keep the schema more readable. When you migrate such a schema Prisma will infer the default names and persist them in the database.

We chose our naming convention to align with PostgreSQL since it is deterministic and helps us maximize the amount of times where we do not need
to render names because they already align with the convention.

| Constraint or index                | Follows convention | Underlying constraint or index names |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `@id` (on `User` > `id` field)     | Yes                | `User_pk`                            |
| `@@index` (on `Post`)              | Yes                | `Post_title_authorName_idx`          |
| `@id` (on `Post` > `id` field)     | Yes                | `Post_pk`                            |
| `@relation` (on `Post` > `author`) | Yes                | `Post_authorName_fkey`               |

### Using custom constraint / index names

You can use the `map` argument to define **custom constraint and index names** in the underlying database.

#### Example

The following example adds custom names to one `@id` and the `@@index`:

```prisma highlight=2,13;normal
model User {
  id    Int    @id(map: "Custom_Primary_Key_Constraint_Name") @default(autoincrement())
  name  String @unique
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id         Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title      String
  authorName String @default("Anonymous")
  author     User?  @relation(fields: [authorName], references: [name])

  @@index([title, authorName], map: "My_Custom_Index_Name")
}
```

The following table lists the name of each constraint and index in the underlying database:

| Constraint or index                | Follows convention | Underlying constraint or index names |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `@id` (on `User` > `id` field)     | No                 | `Custom_Primary_Key_Constraint_Name` |
| `@@index` (on `Post`)              | No                 | `My_Custom_Index_Name`               |
| `@id` (on `Post` > `id` field)     | Yes                | `Post_pk`                            |
| `@relation` (on `Post` > `author`) | Yes                | `Post_authorName_fkey`               |

### Related: Naming indexes and primary keys for Prisma Client

Additionally to `map`, the `@@id` and `@@unique` attributes take an optional `name` argument that allows you to customize your Prisma Client API.

On a model like:

```prisma
model User {
  firstName String
  lastName  String

  @@id([firstName, lastName])
}
```

the default API for selecting on that primary key uses a generated combination of the fields:

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    firstName_lastName: {
      firstName: 'Paul',
      lastName: 'Panther',
    },
  },
})
```

Specifying `@@id([firstName, lastName], name: "fullName")` will change the Prisma Client API to this instead:

```ts highlight=3;edit
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    fullName: {
      firstName: 'Paul',
      lastName: 'Panther',
    },
  },
})
```
