## Overview


_Externally managed tables_ (or _external tables_ for short) in Prisma ORM are tables that can be **queried via Prisma Client** but are **ignored by Prisma Migrate**.

Sometimes, you might not want Prisma ORM to manage specific tablesâ€”such as ones handled by another team or service.

Some concrete use cases for this are:
- auth services like Clerk or Auth0 that manage specific tables with user and session data
- storage services like Supabase Storage with tables for storing metadata about buckets and objects
- a microservice-based organization where specific teams own specific tables in the database

There may be many other scenarios based on custom organizational constraints or preferences where you may not want Prisma ORM to manage specific tables.

:::note
Externally managed tables are frequently used in combination with [multi-schema](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/multi-schema) database setups. However, this is not a hard requirement. You can have only a single schema in your database and also declare externally managed tables within it.

## Workflow

If you want to use external tables, here's the main workflow:
1. Declare the name of the external tables in your Prisma Config file
1. Introspect your database using `npx prisma db pull` so that the table is part of your Prisma schema
1. Re-generate Prisma Client with `npx prisma generate`
1. You can now query the external table using Prisma Client but it will be ignored by Prisma Migrate
1. When the table gets changed (by whoever owns it):
    1. Re-introspect your database using `npx prisma db pull`
    1. Re-generate Prisma Client with `npx prisma generate`

## Example

Assume you have the following database schema:

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Posts table
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
);
```

The Prisma schema only contains the `posts` table at this point:

```prisma
model posts {
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  created_at  DateTime  @default(now())
  title       String
  content     String?
}
```

### 1. Declaring externally managed tables in Prisma Config

You can specify externally managed tables in your [Prisma Config](/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference) file via the `tables.external` property:

```ts
// prisma.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  // required during Early Access
  experimental: {
    // add-next-line
    externalTables: true
  },
  // declare a `users` table
  // add-start
  tables: {
    external: [
      "users",
    ]
  },
  // add-end
})
```

### 2. Introspect the database

Next, you need to update your Prisma schema using [introspection](/orm/prisma-schema/introspection):

```terminal
npx prisma db pull
```

The `users` table is now in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
model posts {
  id         Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  created_at DateTime? @default(now()) @db.Timestamp(6)
  title      String    @db.VarChar(200)
  content    String?
}

// highlight-start
model users {
  id         Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  username   String    @unique @db.VarChar(50)
  email      String    @unique @db.VarChar(100)
  created_at DateTime? @default(now()) @db.Timestamp(6)
}
// highlight-end
```

### 3. Re-generate Prisma Client

In order to be able to query the `users` table, you need to re-generate Prisma Client:

```terminal
npx prisma generate
```

### 4. Query the `users` table using Prisma Client

You can now query the external `users` table with Prisma Client:

```ts
await prisma.users.findMany()
```
