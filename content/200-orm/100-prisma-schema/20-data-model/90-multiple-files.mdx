Multi-file Prisma schema is available via the `prismaSchemaFolder` preview feature in Prisma versions 5.15.0 and later.

## How to enable multi-file Prisma schema support

Multiple Prisma schema file support is currently in preview. To enable the feature, add the `prismaSchemaFolder` feature flag to the `previewFeatures` field of the `generator` block in your Prisma schema: 

```prisma file=schema.prisma showLineNumbers
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  //add-next-line
  previewFeatures = ["prismaSchemaFolder"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

## How to include multiple Prisma schema files in your project

To use multiple Prisma schema files, add a `schema` inside of your current `prisma` directory. With the `prismaSchemaFolder` Preview feature enabled, you can add as many files as you want to the `prisma/schema` directory.

## How to use existing Prisma CLI commands with multiple Prisma schema files

Existing Prisma CLI commands have been updated to support multiple Prisma files. Simply replace references to a file with a directory. As an example, the following `prisma migrate diff` command:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate diff \
--from-empty \
--to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma \
--script > prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql
```

becomes the following:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate diff \
--from-empty \
//highlight-next-line
--to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema \
--script > prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql
```

## Best practices

We’ve found that a few best practices work well with this new feature and will help you get the most out of it:

1. Organize your files by domain: group related models into the same file. For example, keep all user-related models in `user.prisma` while post-related models go in `post.prisma`. Try to avoid having “kitchen sink” schema files.

1. Use clear naming conventions: schema files should be named clearly and succinctly. Use names like `user.prisma` and `post.prisma` and not `myModels.prisma` or `CommentFeaturesSchema.prisma`.

1. Have an obvious “main” schema file: while you can now have as many schema files as you want, you’ll still need a place where you define `datasource` and `generator` blocks. We recommend having a single schema file that’s obviously the “main” file so that these blocks are easy to find. `main.prisma`, `schema.prisma`, and `base.prisma` are a few we’ve seen that work well.

## Examples

Our fork of [dub by dub.co](https://github.com/prisma/dub) is a great example of a real world project adapted to use multiple Prisma schema files.
