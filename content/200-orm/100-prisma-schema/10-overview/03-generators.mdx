metaDescription: 'Generators in your Prisma schema specify what assets are generated when the `prisma generate` command is invoked. This page explains how to configure generators.'
---

A Prisma schema can have one or more generators, represented by the [`generator`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#generator) block:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated/prisma-client-js"
}
```

A generator determines which assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command. 

There are two generators for Prisma Client:
- `prisma-client-js`: Generates Prisma Client into `node_modules`
- `prisma-client` ([Early Access](/orm/more/releases#early-access)): Newer and more flexible version of `prisma-client-js` with ESM support; it outputs plain TypeScript code and _requires_ a custom `output` path

Alternatively, you can configure any npm package that complies with our generator specification.

## Prisma Client: `prisma-client-js`

The generator for Prisma's JavaScript Client accepts multiple additional properties:

- `previewFeatures`: [Preview features](/orm/reference/preview-features) to include
- `binaryTargets`: Engine binary targets for `prisma-client-js` (for example, `debian-openssl-1.1.x` if you are deploying to Ubuntu 18+, or `native` if you are working locally)

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["sample-preview-feature"]
  binaryTargets   = ["linux-musl"]
}
```

### Binary targets

Prisma Client JS (`prisma-client-js`) and TS (`prisma-client-ts`) uses several [engines](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). Engines are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma Client in the form of executable, platform dependent engine files. Depending on which platform you are executing your code on, you need the correct file. "Binary targets" are used to define which files should be present for the target platform(s).

The correct file is particularly important when [deploying](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/deploy-prisma) your application to production, which often differs from your local development environment.

#### The `native` binary target

The `native` binary target is special. It doesn't map to a concrete operating system. Instead, when `native` is specified in `binaryTargets`, Prisma Client detects the _current_ operating system and automatically specifies the correct binary target for it.

As an example, assume you're running **macOS** and you specify the following generator:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

In that case, Prisma Client detects your operating system and finds the right binary file for it based on the [list of supported operating systems](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) .
If you use macOS Intel x86 (`darwin`), then the binary file that was compiled for `darwin` will be selected.
If you use macOS ARM64 (`darwin-arm64`), then the binary file that was compiled for `darwin-arm64` will be selected.

> **Note**: The `native` binary target is the default. You can set it explicitly if you wish to include additional [binary targets](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) for deployment to different environments.


## New `prisma-client` generator (Preview)

The new `prisma-client` generator offers greater control and flexibility when using Prisma ORM across different Node.js environments (including ECMAScript modules). 

The  `prisma-client` generator generates the client **outside** of `node_modules` and inside your application code, allowing you to maintain full visibility over the generated code, including the query engine.

Currently in [Preview](/orm/more/releases#preview), this generator ensures you can bundle your application code exactly the way you want, without relying on hidden or automatic behaviors.

### Getting started

Follow these steps to use the new `prisma-client` generator in your project.

#### 1. Configure the `prisma-client` generator in `schema.prisma`

Update your [`generator`](/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators) block:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  //add-start
  provider = "prisma-client"            // Required
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma/client"  // Required path
  //add-end
}
```

The **`output` option is required** and tells Prisma where to generate the client. You can choose any location suitable for your project structure. For instance, if you have the following layout:

```txt
.
├── package.json
├── prisma
│   └── schema.prisma
├── src
│   └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

Then `../src/generated/prisma/client` places the generated code in `src/generated/prisma/client` relative to `schema.prisma`.

#### 2. Generate the Prisma Client

Generate the `PrismaClient` by running:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This compiles the necessary TypeScript definitions and includes the query engine in the configured `output` folder.

#### 3. Exclude the generated directory from version control

The new generator includes both the TypeScript client code **and** the [query engine](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines#the-query-engine-file). Including the query engine in version control can cause compatibility issues on different machines. To avoid this, add the generated directory to `.gitignore`:

```bash file=".gitignore"
# Recommended:
/src/generated/prisma/client
```

:::note

In the future, you can safely include the generated directory in version control when [Prisma ORM is fully transitioned from Rust to TypeScript](https://www.prisma.io/blog/rust-to-typescript-update-boosting-prisma-orm-performance?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=inline_text).

:::

#### 4. Use the Generated Client in Your Application

After generating the Prisma Client, import the types from the path you specified:

```ts file="src/index.ts"
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma/client"

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

Your Prisma Client is now ready to use in your Node.js project.

### Generator options reference

Use the following options in the `generator client { ... }` block. Only `output` is required. The other fields have defaults or are inferred from your environment and `tsconfig.json`.

```prisma file="schema.prisma"
generator client {
  // Required
  provider = "prisma-client"
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma/client"

  // Optional
  runtime                = "nodejs"
  moduleFormat           = "esm"
  generatedFileExtension = "ts"
  importFileExtension    = "ts"
}
```

Below are the options for the `prisma-client` generator:


| **Option**                | **Default**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `provider`               | `prisma-client-js`                          | It can be `prisma-client-js` or `prisma-client`.                                                                                                                          |
| `output`                 | `../src/generated/prisma` (**required**)           | Directory where the Prisma Client is generated.                                                                                                          |
| `runtime`                | `nodejs`                     | Target runtime environment. <br />Supported values: <br />`nodejs` (alias `node`), `deno`, `bun`, `deno-deploy`, `workerd` (alias `cloudflare`), `edge-light` (alias `vercel`), `react-native`. |
| `moduleFormat`           | Inferred from environment    | Module format (`esm` or `cjs`). Determines whether `import.meta.url` or `__dirname` is used.                                                             |
| `generatedFileExtension` | `ts`                         | File extension for generated TypeScript files (`ts`, `mts`, `cts`).                                                                                      |
| `importFileExtension`    | `ts`                         | File extension used in **import statements**. Can be `ts`, `mts`, `cts`, `js`, `mjs`, `cjs`, or empty (for bare imports).                                                                      |


### Limitations

1. **Namespace usage**: The generated code still relies on TypeScript features like `namespace`, which may cause incompatibility with certain runtime-only setups (e.g., Node.js 22+ without `--experimental-transform-types`). It remains fully compatible with standard runtimes, `tsx`, `ts-node`, and most bundlers.
2. **No browser bundle**: There is currently no official browser build, and importing types or enums in frontend code is not supported.

:::note 

Both limitations will be resolved soon in a future release.

## Community generators

:::note

Existing generators or new ones should not be affected if you are using the [`prismaSchemaFolder`](/orm/reference/preview-features/client-preview-features#currently-active-preview-features) preview feature to manage multiple schema files, unless a generator reads the schema manually.
