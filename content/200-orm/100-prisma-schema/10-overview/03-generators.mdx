metaDescription: 'Generators in your Prisma schema specify what assets are generated when the `prisma generate` command is invoked. This page explains how to configure generators.'
---

A Prisma schema can have one or more generators, represented by the [`generator`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#generator) block:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated/prisma-client-js"
}
```

A generator determines which assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command. 

There are two generators for Prisma Client:

- `prisma-client-js`: Generates Prisma Client into `node_modules`
- `prisma-client` ([Early Access](/orm/more/releases#early-access)): Newer and more flexible version of `prisma-client-js` with ESM support; it outputs plain TypeScript code and _requires_ a custom `output` path

Alternatively, you can configure any npm package that complies with our generator specification.

## `prisma-client-js`

The `prisma-client-js` is the default generator for Prisma ORM 6.X versions and before. It requires the `@prisma/client` npm package and generates Prisma Client into `node_modules`.

### Field reference

The generator for Prisma's JavaScript Client accepts multiple additional properties:

- `previewFeatures`: [Preview features](/orm/reference/preview-features) to include
- `binaryTargets`: Engine binary targets for `prisma-client-js` (for example, `debian-openssl-1.1.x` if you are deploying to Ubuntu 18+, or `native` if you are working locally)

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["sample-preview-feature"]
  binaryTargets   = ["debian-openssl-1.1.x"] // defaults to `"native"`
}
```

### Binary targets

:::note

As of [v6.7.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.7.0), Prisma ORM has the `queryCompiler` Preview feature.

**When enabled, your Prisma Client will be generated [without a Rust-based query engine binary](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine)**:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["queryCompiler", "driverAdapters"] 
}
```

Note that the [driver adapters](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) Preview feature is required alongside `queryCompiler`.

When using the `queryCompiler` Preview feature, the `binaryTargets` field is obsolete and not needed.

:::


The  `prisma-client-js` generator uses several [engines](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). Engines are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma Client in the form of executable, platform-dependent engine files. Depending on which platform you are executing your code on, you need the correct file. "Binary targets" are used to define which files should be present for the target platform(s).

The correct file is particularly important when [deploying](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/deploy-prisma) your application to production, which often differs from your local development environment.

#### The `native` binary target

The `native` binary target is special. It doesn't map to a concrete operating system. Instead, when `native` is specified in `binaryTargets`, Prisma Client detects the _current_ operating system and automatically specifies the correct binary target for it.

As an example, assume you're running **macOS** and you specify the following generator:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

In that case, Prisma Client detects your operating system and finds the right binary file for it based on the [list of supported operating systems](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) .
If you use macOS Intel x86 (`darwin`), then the binary file that was compiled for `darwin` will be selected.
If you use macOS ARM64 (`darwin-arm64`), then the binary file that was compiled for `darwin-arm64` will be selected.

> **Note**: The `native` binary target is the default. You can set it explicitly if you wish to include additional [binary targets](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) for deployment to different environments.

## `prisma-client` (Early Access)

The new `prisma-client` generator offers greater control and flexibility when using Prisma ORM across different JavaScript environments (such as ESM, Bun, Deno, ...).

It generates Prisma Client into a custom directory in your application's codebase that's specified via the `output` field on the `generator` block. This gives you full visibility and control over the generated code. It also [splits](#output-splitting-and-importing-types) the generated Prisma Client library into multiple files.

Currently in [Early Access](/orm/more/releases#early-access), this generator ensures you can bundle your application code exactly the way you want, without relying on hidden or automatic behaviors.

Here are the main differences compared to `prisma-client-js`:

- Requires an `output` path; no “magic” generation into `node_modules` any more
- Supports ESM and CommonJS via the `moduleFormat` field
- More flexible thanks to additional fields
- Outputs plain TypeScript that's bundled just like the rest of your application code

The `prisma-client` generator will become the new default with Prisma ORM v7.

### Getting started

Follow these steps to use the new `prisma-client` generator in your project.

#### 1. Configure the `prisma-client` generator in `schema.prisma`

Update your [`generator`](/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators) block:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  //add-start
  provider = "prisma-client"            // Required
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma"  // Required path
  //add-end
}
```

The **`output` option is required** and tells Prisma ORM where to put the generated Prisma Client code. You can choose any location suitable for your project structure. For instance, if you have the following layout:

```txt
.
├── package.json
├── prisma
│   └── schema.prisma
├── src
│   └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

Then `../src/generated/prisma` places the generated code in `src/generated/prisma` relative to `schema.prisma`.

#### 2. Generate Prisma Client

Generate Prisma Client by running:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This generates the code for Prisma Client (including the query engine binary) into the specified `output` folder.

#### 3. Exclude the generated directory from version control

The new generator includes both the TypeScript client code _and_ the [query engine](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines#the-query-engine-file). Including the query engine in version control can cause compatibility issues on different machines. To avoid this, add the generated directory to `.gitignore`:

```bash file=.gitignore
# Keep the generated Prisma Client + query engine out of version control
/src/generated/prisma
```

:::note

In the future, you can safely include the generated directory in version control when [Prisma ORM is fully transitioned from Rust to TypeScript](https://www.prisma.io/blog/rust-to-typescript-update-boosting-prisma-orm-performance?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=inline_text).

:::

#### 4. Use Prisma Client in your application

#### Importing Prisma Client

After generating the Prisma Client, import it from the path you specified:

```ts file=src/index.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma/client.js"

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

Prisma Client is now ready to use in your project.

#### Importing generated model types

If you're importing types generated for your models, you can do so as follows:

```ts file=src/index.ts
import { User, Post } from "./generated/prisma/models.js"
```

#### Importing generated enum types


If you're importing types generated for your enums, you can do so as follows:

```ts file=src/index.ts
import { Role } from "./generated/prisma/enums.js"
```

### Field reference

Use the following options in the `generator client { ... }` block. Only `output` is required. The other fields have defaults or are inferred from your environment and `tsconfig.json`.

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  // Required
  provider = "prisma-client"
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma"

  // Optional
  runtime                = "nodejs"
  moduleFormat           = "esm"
  generatedFileExtension = "ts"
  importFileExtension    = "ts"
}
```

Below are the options for the `prisma-client` generator:

| **Option**               | **Default**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `output` (**required**)  |                           | Directory where Prisma Client is generated, e.g. `../src/generated/prisma`.                                                                                                                     |
| `runtime`                | `nodejs`                  | Target runtime environment. <br />Supported values: <br />`nodejs` (alias `node`), `deno`, `bun`, `deno-deploy`, `workerd` (alias `cloudflare`), `edge-light` (alias `vercel`), `react-native`. |
| `moduleFormat`           | Inferred from environment | Module format (`esm` or `cjs`). Determines whether `import.meta.url` or `__dirname` is used.                                                                                                    |
| `generatedFileExtension` | `ts`                      | File extension for generated TypeScript files (`ts`, `mts`, `cts`).                                                                                                                             |
| `importFileExtension`    | Inferred from environment | File extension used in **import statements**. Can be `ts`, `mts`, `cts`, `js`, `mjs`, `cjs`, or empty (for bare imports).                                                                       |

### Output splitting and importing types

The `prisma-client-js` generator used to generate all typings into a single `index.d.ts` file, which could lead to [slowing down editors](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4807) (e.g. breaking auto-complete) with large schemas. 

The new `prisma-client` generator now splits the generated Prisma Client library into multiple files and thus avoids the problems of a single, large output file.

**Before** (`prisma-client-js`)

```
generated/
└── prisma
    ├── client.ts
    ├── index.ts # -> this is split into multiple files in 6.7.0
    └── libquery_engine-darwin.dylib.node
```

**After**  (`prisma-client`)

```
generated/
└── prisma
    ├── client.ts
    ├── commonInputTypes.ts
    ├── enums.ts
    ├── internal
    │   ├── class.ts
    │   └── prismaNamespace.ts
    ├── libquery_engine-darwin.dylib.node
    ├── models
    │   ├── Post.ts
    │   └── User.ts
    └── models.ts
```
