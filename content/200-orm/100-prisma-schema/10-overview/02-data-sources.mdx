metaDescription: 'Data sources enable Prisma to connect to your database. This page explains how to configure data sources in your Prisma schema.'

A data source determines how Prisma ORM connects to your database, and is represented by the [`datasource`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) block in the Prisma schema. The following data source uses the `postgresql` provider and includes a connection URL:

::::note
As of Prisma ORM v7, the `url`, `directUrl`, and `shadowDatabaseUrl` fields in the Prisma schema `datasource` block are deprecated. Configure these fields in [Prisma Config](/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference) instead.
::::

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
}
```

A Prisma schema can only have _one_ data source. However, you can:

- [Programmatically override a data source `url` when creating your `PrismaClient`](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#programmatically-override-a-datasource-url)
- [Specify a different URL for Prisma Migrate's shadow database if you are working with cloud-hosted development databases](/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/shadow-database#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases-must-be-created-manually)

> **Note**: Multiple provider support was removed in 2.22.0. Please see [Deprecation of provider array notation](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3834) for more information.

## Securing database connections

Some data source `provider`s allow you to configure your connection with SSL/TLS, and provide parameters for the `url` to specify the location of certificates.

- [Configuring an SSL connection with PostgreSQL](/orm/overview/databases/postgresql#configuring-an-ssl-connection)
- [Configuring an SSL connection with MySQL](/orm/overview/databases/mysql#configuring-an-ssl-connection)
- [Configure a TLS connection with Microsoft SQL Server](/orm/overview/databases/sql-server#connection-details)

Prisma ORM resolves SSL certificates relative to the `./prisma` directory. If your certificate files are located outside that directory, e.g. your project root directory, use relative paths for certificates:

:::note
When you're using a [multi-file Prisma schema](/orm/prisma-schema/overview/location#multi-file-prisma-schema), Prisma ORM resolves SSL certificates relative to the `./prisma/schema` directory.

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public&sslmode=require&sslcert=../server-ca.pem&sslidentity=../client-identity.p12&sslpassword=<REDACTED>"
}
```
