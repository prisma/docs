The default name for the Prisma Schema is a single file `schema.prisma` in your `prisma` folder. When your schema is named like this, the Prisma CLI will detect it automatically.

> If you are using the [`prismaSchemaFolder` preview feature](#multi-file-prisma-schema) any files in the `prisma/schema` directory are detected automatically.

## Prisma Schema location

The Prisma CLI looks for the Prisma Schema in the following locations, in the following order:

1.  The location specified by the [`--schema` flag](/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference), which is available when you `introspect`, `generate`, `migrate`, and `studio`:

    ```terminal
    prisma generate --schema=./alternative/schema.prisma
    ```

2.  The location specified in the `package.json` file (version 2.7.0 and later):

    ```json
    "prisma": {
      "schema": "db/schema.prisma"
    }
    ```

3.  Default locations:

    - `./prisma/schema.prisma`
    - `./schema.prisma`

The Prisma CLI outputs the path of the schema that will be used. The following example shows the terminal output for `prisma db pull`:

```no-lines
Environment variables loaded from .env
//highlight-next-line
Prisma Schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma

Introspecting based on datasource defined in prisma/schema.prisma …

✔ Introspected 4 models and wrote them into prisma/schema.prisma in 239ms

Run prisma generate to generate Prisma Client.
```

## Multi-file Prisma Schema

:::tip

Multi-file Prisma Schema is available via the `prismaSchemaFolder` preview feature in Prisma versions 5.15.0 and later.

:::

To use multiple Prisma Schema files, add a `schema` folder inside of your current `prisma` directory. With the `prismaSchemaFolder` Preview feature enabled, you can add as many files as you want to the `prisma/schema` directory.
```
my-app/
├─ ...
├─ prisma/
│  ├─ schema/
│  │  ├─ post.prisma
│  │  ├─ schema.prisma
│  │  ├─ user.prisma
├─ ...
```

### How to enable multi-file Prisma schema support

Support for multiple Prisma Schema files is currently in preview. To enable the feature, add the `prismaSchemaFolder` feature flag to the `previewFeatures` field of the `generator` block in your Prisma Schema: 

```prisma file=schema.prisma showLineNumbers
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  //add-next-line
  previewFeatures = ["prismaSchemaFolder"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

:::info

When first updating to Prisma ORM 5.15.0 or later, your IDE may not recognize the new multi-file format immediately. Be sure to restart your IDE to confirm you have the latest version of the Prisma VS Code Extension installed.

### How to use existing Prisma CLI commands with multiple Prisma schema files

For most Prisma CLI commands, no changes will be necessary to work with a multi-file Prisma schema. Only in the specific cases where you need to supply a schema via an option will a command need to be changed. In these cases, simply replace references to a file with a directory. As an example, the following `prisma db push` command:

```terminal
npx prisma db push --schema custom/path/to/my/schema.prisma
```

becomes the following:

```terminal
npx prisma db push --schema custom/path/to/my/schema  # note this is now a directory!
```

### Tips for multi-file Prisma Schema

We’ve found that a few patterns work well with this feature and will help you get the most out of it:

- Organize your files by domain: group related models into the same file. For example, keep all user-related models in `user.prisma` while post-related models go in `post.prisma`. Try to avoid having “kitchen sink” schema files.

- Use clear naming conventions: schema files should be named clearly and succinctly. Use names like `user.prisma` and `post.prisma` and not `myModels.prisma` or `CommentFeaturesSchema.prisma`.

- Have an obvious “main” schema file: while you can now have as many schema files as you want, you’ll still need a place where you define `datasource` and `generator` blocks. We recommend having a single schema file that’s obviously the “main” file so that these blocks are easy to find. `main.prisma`, `schema.prisma`, and `base.prisma` are a few we’ve seen that work well.

### Examples

Our fork of [`dub` by dub.co](https://github.com/prisma/dub) is a great example of a real world project adapted to use a multi-file Prisma Schema.
