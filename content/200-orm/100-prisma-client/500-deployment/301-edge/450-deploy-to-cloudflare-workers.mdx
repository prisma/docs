<TopBlock>

Today you'll be deploying a Cloudflare Worker that uses Prisma to save every request to a PostgreSQL database and fetches 20 of the most recent logs.

This guide covers Prisma, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma Accelerate, and Cloudflare Workers.

</TopBlock>

## Prerequisites

- A PostgreSQL database that is publicly accessible
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) account
- [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) account
- Node.js & npm installed
- Git installed

## 1. Set up your application

Wrangler is the official Cloudflare Worker CLI. You will use it to develop and deploy to Cloudflare Workers. This guide uses [Wrangler v3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/).

Open your terminal and navigate to a location of your choice. First, initialize your project using the [create-cloudflare-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare). To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```terminal
npm create cloudflare@latest
```

This will ask you a few questions.

```terminal
In which directory do you want to create your application?
```

Enter the name of your project, for example: `prisma-cloudflare-accelerate`

```terminal
What type of application do you want to create?
```

Select the `"Hello World" Worker` option.

```terminal
Would you like to use TypeScript? (y/n)
```

We also want to use TypeScript, so answer yes.

```terminal
Would you like to use git to manage this Worker? (y/n)
```

We want to use Git, so answer yes.

The command this will create a new project with a minimal preset configuration. Once `create-cloudflare-cli` is done, navigate to the project and open it on your editor of choice.

Next, authenticate the Wrangler CLI with your Cloudflare Workers account. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```terminal
npx wrangler login
```

You can now verify that you're logged in by running `npx wrangler whoami`.

```terminal
npx wrangler whoami
```

## 2. Set up Prisma

Now you're ready to add Prisma to the project.

Install `prisma` as a development dependency:

```terminal
npm install --save-dev prisma
```

Next, initialize Prisma in your project with the following command:

```terminal
npx prisma init
```

This creates a Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

<Admonition>

**Note:**<br /><br />

`prisma init` also creates an `.env` file. The `.env` file will contain a placeholder `DATABASE_URL` variable that will be used to update your database schema using Prisma Migrate. Update this value with your database's connection string.

</Admonition>

Update your Prisma schema with the following data model:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Log {
  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  level   Level
  message String
  meta    Json
}

enum Level {
  Info
  Warn
  Error
}
```

The above data model will be used to persist and retrieve logs from your Cloudflare Worker

## 3. Update your database schema

To map your data model to the database schema, you need to use the `prisma migrate dev` CLI command:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

The command does two things:

1. It creates a new SQL migration file for this migration
1. It runs the SQL migration file against the database

## 4. Enable Accelerate in the Prisma Data Platform

Prisma currently does not work on Cloudflare Workers yet. However, you can use Prisma on Cloudflare Workers through [Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate).

To get started with Prisma Accelerate:

1. Sign up for a free [Prisma Data Platform account](https://console.prisma.io/)
1. Create a project
1. Navigate to the project you created
1. Enable Accelerate
1. Generate an Accelerate connection string and copy it to your clipboard

## 5. Configure the Accelerate connection string in your project

1. Rename the existing `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to `DIRECT_URL`. The `DIRECT_URL` variable will be used perform migrations and introspections.
1. Add the Prisma Accelerate connection string to your `.env` file.

   ```diff file=.env
   -DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."
   +DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=__API_KEY__"
   +DIRECT_URL="postgres://..."
   ```

   Add [`directUrl`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#fields) property in `datasource` block in the `schema.prisma` file.

   ```prisma highlight=4;add file=prisma/schema.prisma
   datasource db {
     provider  = "postgresql"
     url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
     directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
   }
   ```

   > The `directUrl` field is not required for Prisma Accelerate. It allows you to introspect and perform schema migrations.

1. In `wrangler.toml` file, add a `[vars]` key and your connection string.

   ```diff file=wrangler.toml
     name = "prisma-cloudflare-accelerate"
     main = "src/main.ts"
     compatibility_date = "2022-11-07"

   + [vars]
   + DATABASE_URL = "prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=__API_KEY__"
   ```

    <Admonition type="note">

   Cloudflare Workers does not support `.env` files. To set environment variables, you can either adding the `[vars]` key in your `wrangler.toml` file or saving your environment variables in a `.dev.vars` file. Refer to [Cloudflare's documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/bindings/#interact-with-your-environment-variables-locally) to learn more.

    </Admonition>

1. Install the Prisma Accelerate extension

   ```bash
   npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
   ```

You are now ready to generate a Prisma Client.

## 6. Generate a Prisma Client

Next, generate Prisma Client that connects to your database through [Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate) over HTTP.

```terminal
npx prisma generate --no-engine
```

<Admonition>

The `--no-engine` flag is available from Prisma 5.2.0 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Prisma, use the `--accelerate` flag.

```terminal
npx prisma generate --accelerate
```

</Admonition>

The generated Client has a smaller bundle size and is optimized for edge environments like Cloudflare Workers.

The smaller bundle size is due to the fact that the interfaces talking to the database (the [Prisma engines](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines)) are no longer bundled with Prisma Client as this logic is now handled by Prisma Accelerate.

## 7. Develop the Cloudflare Worker function

You're now ready to create a Cloudflare Worker. Create a `src/index.ts` file with the following code:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

export interface Env {
  DATABASE_URL: string
}

export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<Response> {
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({
      datasourceUrl: env.DATABASE_URL,
    }).$extends(withAccelerate())

    await prisma.log.create({
      data: {
        level: 'Info',
        message: `${request.method} ${request.url}`,
        meta: {
          headers: JSON.stringify(request.headers),
        },
      },
    })

    const { data, info } = await prisma.log
      .findMany({
        take: 20,
        orderBy: {
          id: 'desc',
        },
      })
      .withAccelerateInfo()

    console.log(JSON.stringify(info))

    return new Response(`request method: ${request.method}!`)
  },
}
```

> The [`info`](/accelerate/api-reference#return-type) object has additional information which can be useful for debugging.
> Accelerate can also be used to cache your query results. You can find more information on caching with Prisma Accelerate in [here](/accelerate).

Run `npm run dev` to see your worker in development:

```
ðŸ‘‚  Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

Go ahead and open `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. If all goes well, you should see:

```
request method: GET!
```

Refresh the page a couple times to verify that it's working.

## 8. Publish to Cloudflare Workers

You're now ready to deploy to Cloudflare Workers. Run the following command:

```terminal
npm run deploy
```

This will package and upload to Cloudflare. With a bit of luck, you'll see the following:

```
âœ¨  Built successfully, built project size is 94 KiB.
âœ¨  Successfully published your script to
https://prisma-cloudflare-accelerate.ankman.workers.dev
```

Visit your deployment URL and you'll again see:

```
request method: GET!
```

You're all set! You've successfully deployed a Cloudflare Worker written in TypeScript that uses Prisma to talk to your PostgreSQL database.
