This guide takes you through the steps to set up and deploy a serverless application that uses Prisma to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Vercel is a cloud platform that hosts static sites, serverless, and edge functions. You can integrate a Vercel project with a GitHub repository to allow you to deploy automatically when you make new commits.

We created an [example application](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-vercel) using Next.js you can use as a reference when deploying an application using Prisma to Vercel.

While our examples use Next.js, you can deploy other applications to Vercel. See [Using Express with Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/using-express-with-vercel) and [Nuxt on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nuxt) as examples of other options.

## Generate Prisma during build

Vercel will automatically cache dependencies on deployment. For most applications, this will not cause any issues. However, for Prisma, it may result in an outdated version of Prisma Client on a change in your Prisma schema. To avoid this issue, add `prisma generate` to the `postinstall` script of your application:

```json file=package.json highlight=4;add
{
  ...
  "scripts" {
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
  ...
}
```

This will re-generate Prisma Client at build time so that your deployment always has an up-to-date client.

<Admonition>

If you see `prisma: command not found` errors during your deployment to Vercel, you are missing `prisma` in your dependencies. By default, `prisma` is a dev dependency and may need to be moved to be a standard dependency.

</Admonition>

Another option to avoid an outdated Prisma Client is to use [a custom output path](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client#using-a-custom-output-path) and check your client into version control. This way each deployment is guaranteed to include the correct Prisma Client.

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3;add
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated/client"
}
```

## Add a separate database for preview deployments

By default, your application will have a single _production_ environment associated with the `main` git branch of your repository. If you open a pull request to change your application, Vercel creates a new _preview_ environment.

Vercel uses the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable you define when you import the project for both the production and preview environments. This causes problems if you create a pull request with a database schema migration because the pull request will change the schema of the production database.

To prevent this, use a _second_ hosted database to handle preview deployments. Once you have that connection string, you can add a `DATABASE_URL` for your preview environment using the Vercel dashboard:

1. Click the **Settings** tab of your Vercel project.

2. Click **Environment variables**.

3. Add an environment variable with a key of `DATABASE_URL` and select only the **Preview** environment option:

   ![Add an environment variable for the preview environment](./images/300-60-deploy-to-vercel-preview-environment-variable.png)

4. Set the value to the connection string of your second database:

   ```code
   postgresql://dbUsername:dbPassword@myhost:5432/mydb
   ```

5. Click **Save**.

## Connection pooling

When you use a Function-as-a-Service provider, like Vercel Serverless functions, every invocation may result in a new connection to your database. This can cause your database to quickly run out of open connections and cause your application to stall. For this reason, pooling connections to your database is essential.

You can use [Accelerate](/accelerate) for connection pooling, to reduce your Prisma Client bundle size, and to avoid cold starts.
