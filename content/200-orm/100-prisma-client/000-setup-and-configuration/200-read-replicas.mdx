Read replicas enable you to distribute workloads across database replicas for high-traffic workloads. The [read replicas extension](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas), `@prisma/extension-read-replicas`, adds support for read-only database replicas to Prisma Client.

The read replicas extension supports Prisma versions [5.2.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/5.2.0) and higher. If you run into a bug or have feedback, create a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas/issues/new).

## Setup the read replicas extension

Install the extension:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/extension-read-replicas
```

Initialize the extension by extending your Prisma Client instance and provide the extension a connection string that points to your read replica in the `url` option of the extension.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { readReplicas } from '@prisma/extension-read-replicas'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  readReplicas({
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL_REPLICA,
  })
)

// Query is run against the database replica
await prisma.post.findMany()

// Query is run against the primary database
await prisma.post.create({ 
  data: {/** */},
})
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

All read operations, e.g. `findMany`, will be executed against the database replica with the above setup. All write operations — e.g. `create`, `update` — and `$transaction` queries, will be executed against your primary database.

If you run into a bug or have feedback, create a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas/issues/new).

## Configure multiple database replicas

The `url` property also accepts an array of values, i.e. an array of all your database replicas you would like to configure:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  readReplicas({
    url: [
      process.env.DATABASE_URL_REPLICA_1,
      process.env.DATABASE_URL_REPLICA_2,
    ],
  })
)
```

If you have more than one read replica configured, a database replica will be randomly selected to execute your query.

## Executing read operations against your primary database

You can use the `$primary()` method to explicitly execute a read operation against your primary database:

```ts
const posts = await prisma.$primary().post.findMany()
```

## Executing operations against a database replica

You can use the `$replica()` method to explicitly execute your query against a replica instead of your primary database:

```ts
const result = await prisma.$replica().$queryRaw`SELECT ...`
```
