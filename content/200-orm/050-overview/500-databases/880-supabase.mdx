This guide discusses the concepts behind using Prisma and Supabase, explains the commonalities and differences between Supabase and other database providers, and leads you through the process for configuring your application to integrate with Supabase.

## What is Supabase?

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is a PostgreSQL hosting service and open source Firebase alternative providing all the backend features you need to build a product. Unlike Firebase, Supabase is backed by PostgreSQL which can be accessed directly using Prisma.

To learn more about Supabase, you can check out their architecture [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture) and features [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/features)

## Commonalities with other database providers

Many aspects of using Prisma with Supabase are just like using Prisma with any other relational database. You can still:

- model your database with the [Prisma Schema Language](/orm/prisma-schema)
- use Prisma's existing [`postgresql` database connector](/orm/overview/databases/postgresql) in your schema, along with the [connection string Supabase provides you](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#finding-your-connection-string)
- use [Introspection](/orm/prisma-schema/introspection) for existing projects if you already have a database schema in Supabase
- use [`db push`](/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/prototyping-your-schema) to push changes in your schema to Supabase
- use [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) in your application to talk to the database server at Supabase

## Specific considerations

If you'd like to use the [connection pooling feature](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/prisma#connection-pooling-with-supabase) available with Supabase, you will
need to add `pgbouncer=true` to the end of the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable used in the `datasource.url` property:

```env file=.env
# Connect to Supabase with PgBouncer.
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres.__YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT__:__PASSWORD__@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
```

If you would like to use the Prisma CLI in order to perform other actions on your database (e.g. migrations) you will need to add a `DIRECT_URL` environment variable to use in the `datasource.directUrl` property so that the CLI can bypass PgBouncer:

```env file=.env highlight=4-5;add
# Connect to Supabase with PgBouncer.
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres.__YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT__:__PASSWORD__@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"

# Direct connection to the database. Used for migrations.
DIRECT_URL="postgres://postgres:__PASSWORD__@db.__YOUR SUPABASE_PROJECT__.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

You can then update your `schema.prisma` to use the new direct URL:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

More information about the `directUrl` field can be found [here](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#fields).

<Admonition type="info">

We strongly recommend using `pgbouncer` in addition to `DIRECT_URL`. You will gain the great developer experience of the Prisma CLI while also allowing for connections to be pooled regardless of deployment strategy. While this is not strictly necessary for every app, serverless solutions will inevitably require connection pooling.
