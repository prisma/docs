## Default built-in drivers

One of Prisma Client's components is the [Query Engine](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines) (which is implemented in Rust). The Query Engine is responsible for transforming Prisma Client queries into SQL statements. It connects to your database via TCP using built-in drivers that don't require additional setup.

:::note

As of [v6.15.0](https://pris.ly/release/6.16.0), Prisma ORM can be used without Rust engines in production applications. Learn more [here](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine).

**When enabled, your Prisma Client will be generated without a Rust-based query engine binary**:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider   = "prisma-client-js" // or "prisma-client"
  output     = "../src/generated/prisma"
  engineType = "client"           // no Rust engine
}
```

Note that [driver adapters](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) are required if you want to use Prisma ORM without Rust engines.

You can [read about the performance and DX improvements](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-orm-without-rust-latest-performance-benchmarks) of this change on our blog.

## Driver adapters

Prisma Client can connect and run queries against your database using JavaScript database drivers using **driver adapters**. Adapters act as _translators_ between Prisma Client and the JavaScript database driver.

Prisma Client will use the Query Engine to transform the Prisma Client query to SQL and run the generated SQL queries via the JavaScript database driver.

There are two different types of driver adapters:
- [Database driver adapters](#database-driver-adapters)
- [Serverless driver adapters](#serverless-driver-adapters)

> **Note**: Driver adapters enable [edge deployments](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/overview) of applications that use Prisma ORM.

### Database driver adapters

You can connect to your database using a Node.js-based driver from Prisma Client using a database driver adapter. Prisma maintains the adapters for the following drivers:

- PostgreSQL
  - [`pg`](/orm/overview/databases/postgresql#using-the-node-postgres-driver)
- MySQL/MariaDB
  - [`mariadb`](/orm/overview/databases/mysql#using-the-mariadb-driver)
- SQLite
  - [`better-sqlite3`](/orm/overview/databases/sqlite#using-the-better-sqlite3-driver)
  - [`libSQL`](/orm/overview/databases/turso#how-to-connect-and-query-a-turso-database) (Turso)
- MS SQL Server
  - [`node-mssql`](/orm/overview/databases/sql-server#using-the-node-mssql-driver)

### Serverless driver adapters

Database providers, such as Neon and PlanetScale, allow you to connect to your database using other protocols besides TCP, such as HTTP and WebSockets. These database drivers are optimized for connecting to your database in serverless and edge environments.

Prisma ORM maintains the following serverless driver adapters:
- [Neon](/orm/overview/databases/neon#how-to-use-neons-serverless-driver-with-prisma-orm) (and Vercel Postgres)
- [PlanetScale](/orm/overview/databases/planetscale#how-to-use-the-planetscale-serverless-driver-with-prisma-orm-preview)
- [Cloudflare D1](/orm/overview/databases/cloudflare-d1)

### Community-maintained database driver adapters

You can also build your own driver adapter for the database you're using. The following is a list of community-maintained driver adapters:
- [TiDB Cloud Serverless Driver](https://github.com/tidbcloud/prisma-adapter)
- [PGlite - Postgres in WASM](https://github.com/lucasthevenet/pglite-utils/tree/main/packages/prisma-adapter)

## How to use driver adapters

Refer to the following pages to learn more about how to use the specific driver adapters with the specific database providers:

- [MS SQL Server](/orm/overview/databases/sql-server#using-the-node-mssql-driver)

## Notes about using driver adapters

### New driver adapters API in v6.6.0

In [v6.6.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.6.0), we introduced a simplified version for instantiating Prisma Client when using driver adapters. You now don't need to create an instance of the driver/client to pass to a driver adapter, instead you can just create the driver adapter directly (and pass the driver's options to it if needed).

Here is an example using the `@prisma/adapter-libsql` adapter:

#### Before 6.6.0

Earlier versions of Prisma ORM required you to first instantiate the driver itself, and then use that instance to create the Prisma driver adapter. Here is an example using the `@libsql/client` driver for LibSQL:

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@libsql/client'
import { PrismaLibSQL } from '@prisma/adapter-libsql'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

// Old way of using driver adapters (before 6.6.0)
const driver = createClient({
  url: env.LIBSQL_DATABASE_URL,
  authToken: env.LIBSQL_DATABASE_TOKEN,
})
const adapter = new PrismaLibSQL(driver)

const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

#### 6.6.0 and later

As of the 6.6.0 release, you instantiate the driver adapter _directly_ with the options of your preferred JS-native driver.:

```typescript
import { PrismaLibSQL } from '@prisma/adapter-libsql'
import { PrismaClient } from '../prisma/prisma-client'

const adapter = new PrismaLibSQL({
  url: env.LIBSQL_DATABASE_URL,
  authToken: env.LIBSQL_DATABASE_TOKEN,
})

const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

### Driver adapters don't read the connection string from the Prisma schema

When using Prisma ORM's built-in drivers, the connection string is read from the `url` field of the `datasource` block in your Prisma schema.

On the other hand, when using a driver adapter, the connection string needs to be provided in your _application code_ when the driver adapter is set up initially. Here is how this is done for the `pg` driver and the `@prisma/adapter-pg` adapter:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: env.DATABASE_URL })
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

See the docs for the driver adapter you're using for concrete setup instructions.

### Driver adapters and custom output paths

Since Prisma 5.9.0, when using the driver adapters Preview feature along with a [custom output path for Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client#using-a-custom-output-path), you cannot reference Prisma Client using a relative path.

Let's assume you had `output` in your Prisma schema set to `../src/generated/client`:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "../src/generated/client"
}
```

What you should _not_ do is reference that path relatively:

```ts no-copy
// what not to do!
import { PrismaClient } from './src/generated/client'

const client = new PrismaClient()
```

Instead, you will need to use a linked dependency.

<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="npm">

```terminal
npm add db@./src/generated/client
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm">

```terminal
pnpm add db@link:./src/generated/client
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```terminal
yarn add db@link:./src/generated/client
```

</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

Now, you should be able to reference your generated client using `db`!

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from 'db'

const client = new PrismaClient()
```

### Driver adapters and specific frameworks

#### Nuxt

Using a driver adapter with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) to deploy to an edge function environment does not work out of the box, but adding the `nitro.experimental.wasm` configuration option fixes that:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  nitro: {
    // ...
    experimental: {
      wasm: true,
    },
  },
  // ...
})
```

### Driver adapters and TypedSQL

[TypedSQL](/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/typedsql) lets you write fully type-safe SQL queries that integrate directly with Prisma Client. This feature is useful if you want the flexibility of writing SQL while still benefiting from Prisma's type-safety.

You can also use driver adapters together with TypedSQL to connect through JavaScript database drivers. TypedSQL works with all supported driver adapters except `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`. For SQLite support, use [`@prisma/adapter-libsql`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/adapter-libsql) instead.
