This guide discusses the concepts behind using Prisma ORM and Cloudflare D1, explains the commonalities and differences between Cloudflare D1 and other database providers, and leads you through the process for configuring your application to integrate with Cloudflare D1.

Prisma ORM support for Cloudflare D1 is currently in [Preview](/orm/more/releases#preview). We would appreciate your feedback [on GitHub](tbd).

## What is Cloudflare D1?

D1 is Cloudflare’s native serverless database. It’s based on SQLite and can be used when deploying applications with Cloudflare. D1 was initially [launched in 2022](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-d1) and is currently in a public beta stage.

Following Cloudflare’s principles of geographic distribution and bringing compute and data closer to application users, D1 supports automatic read-replication. It dynamically manages the number of database instances and locations of read-only replicas based on how many queries a database is getting, and from where.

For write-operations, queries travel to a single primary instance in order to propagate the changes to all read-replicas and ensure data consistency.

## Commonalities with other database providers

D1 is based on SQLite.

Many aspects of using Prisma ORM with D1 are just like using Prisma ORM with any other relational database. You can still:

- model your database with the [Prisma Schema Language](/orm/prisma-schema)
- use Prisma ORM's existing [`sqlite` database connector](/orm/overview/databases/sqlite) in your schema
- use [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) in your application to talk to the database server at D1

## Differences to consider

There are a number of differences between D1 and SQLite to consider. You should be aware of the following when deciding to use D1 and Prisma ORM:

- **Local and remote D1 (SQLite) databases**. Cloudflare provides local and remote versions of D1. The [local](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/configuration/local-development) version is managed using the `--local` option of the `wrangler d1` CLI and is located in `.wranger/state`. The [remote](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/configuration/remote-development) version is managed by Cloudflare and is accessed via HTTP.
- **Making schema changes**. Since D1 uses HTTP to connect to the remote database, this makes it incompatible with Prisma Migrate. However, you can use [`prisma migrate diff`](/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference#migrate-diff) to create a schema migration and then apply the changes to your database using the [`wrangler d1 execute`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#execute) command of the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/).

## How to connect to D1 in Cloudflare Workers or Cloudflare pages

When using Prisma ORM with D1, you need to use the `sqlite` database provider and the `@prisma/adapter-d1` [driver adapter](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters).

If you want to deploy a Cloudflare Worker with D1 and Prisma ORM, follow these [step-by-step instructions](/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-cloudflare#d1).
