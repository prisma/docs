The SQLite data source connector connects Prisma ORM to a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database file. These files always have the file ending `.db` (e.g.: `dev.db`).

By default, the SQLite connector contains a database driver responsible for connecting to your database. You can use a [driver adapter](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) (Preview) to connect to your database using a JavaScript database driver from Prisma Client.

## Example

To connect to a SQLite database file, you need to configure a [`datasource`](/orm/prisma-schema/overview/data-sources) block in your [Prisma schema](/orm/prisma-schema):

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}
```

The fields passed to the `datasource` block are:

- `provider`: Specifies the `sqlite` data source connector.
- `url`: Specifies the [connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls) for the SQLite database. The connection URL always starts with the prefix `file:` and then contains a file path pointing to the SQLite database file. In this case, the file is located in the same directory and called `dev.db`.


## Using the `better-sqlite3` driver

As of [`v5.4.0`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/5.4.0), you can use Prisma ORM with database drivers from the JavaScript ecosystem (instead of using Prisma ORM's built-in drivers). You can do this by using a [driver adapter](/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers).

For SQLite, [`better-sqlite3`](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/) is one of the most popular drivers in the JavaScript ecosystem. It can be used with any SQLite database file.

This section explains how you can use it with Prisma ORM and the `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3` driver adapter.

### 1. Enable the `driverAdapters` Preview feature flag

Since driver adapters are currently in [Preview](/orm/more/releases#preview), you need to enable its feature flag on the `datasource` block in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
// schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Once you have added the feature flag to your schema, re-generate Prisma Client:

```terminal copy
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Install the dependencies

Next, install the `pg` package and Prisma ORM's driver adapter:

```terminal copy
npm install better-sqlite3
npm install @prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3
```

### 3. Instantiate Prisma Client using the driver adapter

Finally, when you instantiate Prisma Client, you need to pass an instance of Prisma ORM's driver adapter to the `PrismaClient` constructor:

```ts copy
import { tbd } from '@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const connectionString = `${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`

// tbd
const adapter = new tbd
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

Notice that this code requires the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to be set to your SQLite connection string (i.e. file path). You can learn more about the connection string below.


## Type mapping between SQLite to Prisma schema

The SQLite connector maps the [scalar types](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models#scalar-fields) from the [data model](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models) to native column types as follows:

> Alternatively, see [Prisma schema reference](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#model-field-scalar-types) for type mappings organized by Prisma ORM type.

### Native type mapping from Prisma ORM to SQLite

| Prisma ORM | SQLite        |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `String`   | `TEXT`        |
| `Boolean`  | `BOOLEAN`     |
| `Int`      | `INTEGER`     |
| `BigInt`   | `INTEGER`     |
| `Float`    | `REAL`        |
| `Decimal`  | `DECIMAL`     |
| `DateTime` | `NUMERIC`     |
| `Json`     | `JSONB`       |
| `Bytes`    | `BLOB`        |
| `Enum`     | `TEXT`        |

:::note

SQLite doesn't have a dedicated Boolean type. While this table shows `BOOLEAN`, columns are assigned a **NUMERIC affinity** (storing `0` for false and `1` for true). [Learn more](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#boolean).

:::

:::warning

When using `enum` fields in SQLite, be aware of the following:

- **No database-level enforcement for correctness**: If you bypass Prisma ORM and store an invalid enum entry in the database, Prisma Client queries will fail at runtime when reading that entry.
- **No migration-level enforcement for correctness**: It's possible to end up with incorrect data after schema changes similarly to MongoDB (since the enums aren't checked by the database).

## Rounding errors on big numbers

SQLite is a loosely-typed database. If your Schema has a field of type `Int`, then Prisma ORM prevents you from inserting a value larger than an integer. However, nothing prevents the database from directly accepting a bigger number. These manually-inserted big numbers cause rounding errors when queried.

To avoid this problem, Prisma ORM 4.0.0 and later checks numbers on the way out of the database to verify that they fit within the boundaries of an integer. If a number does not fit, then Prisma ORM throws a P2023 error, such as:

```
Inconsistent column data: Conversion failed:
Value 9223372036854775807 does not fit in an INT column,
try migrating the 'int' column type to BIGINT
```

## Connection details

### Connection URL

The connection URL of a SQLite connector points to a file on your file system. For example, the following two paths are equivalent because the `.db` is in the same directory:

```prisma file=schema.prisma showLineNumbers
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}
```

is the same as:

```prisma file=schema.prisma showLineNumbers
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:dev.db"
}
```

You can also target files from the root or any other place in your file system:

```prisma file=schema.prisma showLineNumbers
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:/Users/janedoe/dev.db"
}
```
