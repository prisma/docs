As a Prisma ORM user, you're already experiencing the power of type-safe database queries and intuitive data modelling. When scaling production applications, however, new challenges often emerge. You might find yourself grappling with connection pooling complexities, seeking ways to implement effective caching strategies, or striving to build real-time features.

Leveraging the Prisma ecosystem you're already familiar with, Accelerate and Pulse can help you:

- Increase your application's performance and scalability
- Build engaging real-time experiences
- Simplify your infrastructure management

Let's explore how these tools can transform your development experience and supercharge your applications.

## Boost your application performance with Prisma Accelerate

Prisma Accelerate streamlines your database operations, enabling you to handle more traffic with less infrastructure. It combines powerful connection pooling and global caching to scale your data layer.

**Accelerate enhances your application through:**

- **Global Connection Pooling**: Position your connection pooler in one of 15+ global regions, bringing management closer to your database. Unlock high-performance distributed workloads across serverless and edge environments.
- **Intelligent Caching**: Cache query results across 300+ global points of presence. Accelerate extends your Prisma Client, offering granular control over caching patterns such as ttl and swr on a per-query basis.
- **Effortless Scaling**: Scale to millions of queries per day without infrastructure changes. Efficiently manage database connections and serve more users with fewer resources.

Real-world Impact: Formbricks, a growing startup, now powers over 50 million monthly queries with Accelerate, experiencing significant performance gains.

## Power real-time capabilities with Prisma Pulse

Pulse enables you to stream change events from your database to your application at scale, triggering real-time events and actions. Pulse extends your Prisma Client, enabling you to manage database events with the same type-safety you're accustomed to from the ORM. With resumable, ordered, and exact event delivery guarantees, you'll never miss a critical update, ensuring reliable event-driven workflows.

**Use Cases:**

- Simplify event-driven workflows: React to database changes to drive background jobs and workflows. Stop polling, start streaming.
- Build real-time experiences: Power real-time functionality in your application, with Pulse as the database-event engine.
- Keep your services in sync: Synchronize data to external services when your data changes without cluttering your code with extra API calls.

Both Accelerate and Pulse integrate seamlessly with your existing Prisma setup through Prisma Client Extensions, allowing you to add custom, type-safe functionality to your Prisma Client. This opens up a world of possibilities beyond standard ORM features, from optimized caching strategies to real-time data synchronization.
