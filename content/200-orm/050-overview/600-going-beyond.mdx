description: Prisma ORM addresses many development needs, but Prisma's additional products like Accelerate and Pulse can further enhance performance and real-time capabilities.
---

As a Prisma ORM user, you're already experiencing the power of type-safe database queries and intuitive data modeling. When scaling production applications, however, new challenges emerge. You might find yourself grappling with connection pooling complexities, seeking ways to implement effective caching strategies, or striving to build complex, event-driven, or real-time features.

Let's explore how these products can transform your development experience and supercharge your applications.

## Boost application performance with Prisma Accelerate

As your application scales, you will begin to reach for tools that allow for more traffic, such as a connection pooling solution and caching. Prisma Accelerate replaces the need for these tools and, better yet, you don’t have to worry about setting up any infrastructure at all!

Accelerate combines global connection pooling and caching to scale your data layer to match all of your users’ needs.

Try out the [Accelerate speed test](https://accelerate-speed-test.prisma.io/) to see what’s possible.

### Reduce database load with connection pooling

Place your connection pooler in one of 15+ global regions, minimizing latency for database operations. Enable high-performance distributed workloads across serverless and edge environments.

### Improve query performance with caching

Cache query results across 300+ global points of presence. Accelerate extends your Prisma Client, offering intuitive, granular control over caching patterns such as `ttl` and `swr` on a per-query basis.

### Handle scaling traffic with managed infrastructure

Scale to millions of queries per day without infrastructure changes. Efficiently manage database connections and serve more users with fewer resources.

### Get started with Accelerate today

Accelerate fits naturally into any Prisma ORM project. Follow our [getting started guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/accelerate/getting-started) to get set up with Prisma Accelerate, install the `@prisma/extension-accelerate` library, and get instant access to full edge environment support, connection pooling, and caching.

```tsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

// 1. Extend your Prisma Client with the Accelerate extension
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

// 2. (Optionally) add cache to your Prisma queries
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  cacheStrategy: { 
    ttl: 30, // Serve fresh data for 30 seconds
    swr: 60  // Serve stale data for up to 60 seconds while fetching fresh data
  }
})
```

To see more examples, visit our [examples repo](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples) or try them out yourself with `npx try-prisma`.

## Power event-driven, real-time code with Prisma Pulse

With JavaScript and TypeScript web frameworks, synchronous “request/response” code is a natural fit for Prisma ORM. However, some workloads are better handled by real-time events that trigger specific actions within your application code. 

With Pulse, you can stream database changes directly to your application! No need to constantly poll the database for changes or set up complex infrastructure to achieve this.

Pulse extends Prisma Client, giving you an API that allows you to react to database changes as they happen with the same, great developer experience of Prisma ORM.

```tsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

// Extend your Prisma Client with the Pulse extension
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({ apiKey: process.env.PULSE_API_KEY })
)

// You're now ready to develop real-time code with Pulse!
const stream = await prisma.user.stream()

for await (const event of stream) {
	console.log('Received database event:', event)
}
```

### Simplify event-driven workflows

Remove the need for complicated scheduling and queues and let events arrive directly from your database.

```tsx
// Stream new users on the `User` model in real-time
const stream = await prisma.user.stream({
  create: { },               // Filter for create-events
  name: 'user-create-events' // Ensure no events get lost
});

for await (let event of stream) {
  const { email } = event.created;
  
  // Send welcome email to user after sign up
  await sendWelcomeEmail({ email });
}
```

### Build real-time experiences

When someone sends a chat message through your app, it’s critical that it’s delivered quickly. Power any real-time functionality with Pulse as the database-event engine.

```tsx
// Stream unread messages on the `Message` model in real-time
const stream = await prisma.message.stream({
  create: { read: false }, // Filter for unread messages
});

for await (let event of stream) {
  const { senderId, message, chatId } = event.created;
  
  //  Update the chat UI and send a notification
  await sendMessageInChat({ senderId, message, chatId });
}
```

### Keep services in sync

Synchronize data to external services when your data changes without cluttering your code with extra API calls.

```tsx
// Stream new orders on the `Order` model in real-time
const stream = await prisma.order.stream({
  create: { },             // Filter for create-events
  name: 'new-order-events' // Ensure no events get lost
});

for await (let event of stream) {
  const { orderId, orderItems } = event.created;
  
  //  Update the inventory
  await updateExternalInventoryFromOrder({ orderId, orderItems });
}
```

## Grow with Prisma

Both Accelerate and Pulse build on Prisma ORM through [Prisma Client Extensions](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions). This opens up features that we couldn’t include in the ORM like globally-optimized caching and real-time data synchronization. Create an account on the [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io) and explore how Accelerate and Pulse can help you build scalable, high-performance applications!

Improving developer experience doesn’t stop at Accelerate and Pulse. Prisma is building and expanding our products to improve every aspect of Data DX and we’d love to hear what you think. Join our community and learn more about our products below
