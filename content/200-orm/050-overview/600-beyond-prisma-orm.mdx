description: Prisma ORM addresses many development needs, but Prisma's additional products like Prisma Postgres, Accelerate and Optimize can further enhance scalability and performance for your applications.

As a Prisma ORM user, you're already experiencing the power of type-safe database queries and intuitive data modeling. When scaling production applications, however, new challenges emerge. As an app matures it’s a given that you’ll begin to experience connection pooling complexities or find ways to effectively cache common queries.

Instead of spending your valuable time overcoming these challenges, let’s explore how Prisma can help by extending the capabilities of the ORM as your application grows.

## Boost application performance with Prisma Accelerate

As your application scales, you'll likely need tools to handle increased traffic efficiently. This often involves implementing connection pooling to manage database connections and caching strategies to reduce database load and improve response times. Prisma Accelerate addresses these needs in a single solution, eliminating the need to set up and manage separate infrastructure.

Prisma Accelerate is particularly useful for applications deployed to serverless and edge environments (also know as Function-as-a-Service) because these deployments lend themselves towards many orders of magnitude more connections being created than a traditional, long-lived application. For these apps, Prisma Accelerate has the added benefit of protecting your database from day one and keeping your app online [regardless of traffic you experience](https://www.prisma.io/blog/saving-black-friday-with-connection-pooling).

Try out the [Accelerate speed test](https://accelerate-speed-test.prisma.io/) to see what’s possible.

### Improve query performance with connection pooling

Place your connection pooler in one of 15+ global regions, minimizing latency for database operations. Enable high-performance distributed workloads across serverless and edge environments.

### Reduce query latency and database load with caching

Cache query results across 300+ global points of presence. Accelerate extends your Prisma Client, offering intuitive, granular control over caching patterns such as `ttl` and `swr` on a per-query basis.

### Handle scaling traffic with managed infrastructure

Scale to millions of queries per day without infrastructure changes. Efficiently manage database connections and serve more users with fewer resources.

### Get started with Accelerate today

Accelerate integrates seamlessly with your Prisma ORM project through the `@prisma/extension-accelerate`  client extension. Get started quickly with our [setup guide](/accelerate/getting-started) and instantly access full edge environment support, connection pooling, and global caching.

```tsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

// 1. Extend your Prisma Client with the Accelerate extension
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

// 2. (Optionally) add cache to your Prisma queries
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  cacheStrategy: { 
    ttl: 30, // Consider data fresh for 30 seconds
    swr: 60  // Serve stale data for up to 60 seconds while fetching fresh data
  }
})
```

## Grow with Prisma

Prisma Accelerate take features built into Prisma ORM and build upon them by adding additional capabilities like globally-optimized caching and connection pooling. Get started for free the [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/login) and explore how Accelerate can help you build scalable, high-performance applications!

Improving developer experience doesn’t stop at Accelerate. Prisma is building and expanding our products, such as [Prisma Optimize](https://www.prisma.io/optimize) and [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres), to improve every aspect of Data DX and we’d love to hear what you think. Join our community and learn more about our products below.

Accelerate and Optimize build on Prisma ORM through [Prisma Client Extensions](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions). This opens up features that we couldn’t include in the ORM like globally-optimized caching and connection pooling.
