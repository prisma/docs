The Prisma CLI has a dedicated command for prototyping schemas: [`db push`](/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference#db-push)

`db push` uses the same engine as Prisma Migrate to synchronize your Prisma schema with your database schema. The `db push` command:

1. Introspects the database to infer and executes the changes required to make your database schema reflect the state of your Prisma schema.
2. By default, after changes have been applied to the database schema, generators are triggered (for example, Prisma Client). You do not need to manually invoke `prisma generate`.
3. If `db push` anticipates that the changes could result in data loss, it will:

   - Throw an error
   - Require the `--accept-data-loss` option if you still want to make the changes

> **Notes**:
>
> - `db push` does not interact with or rely on migrations. The migrations table `_prisma_migrations` will not be created or updated, and no migration files will be generated.
> - When working with PlanetScale, we recommend that you use `db push` instead of `migrate`. For details refer to our Getting Started documentation, either [Start from scratch](/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-planetscale) or [Add to existing project](/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-planetscale) depending on your situation.

## Choosing <inlinecode>db push</inlinecode> or Prisma Migrate

`db push` works well if:

- You want to **quickly prototype and iterate** on schema design locally without the need to deploy these changes to other environments such as other developers, or staging and production environments.
- You are prioritizing reaching a **desired end-state** and not the changes or steps executed to reach that end-state (there is no way to preview changes made by `db push`)
- You do not need to control how schema changes impact data. There is no way to orchestrate schema and data migrations—if `db push` anticipates that changes will result in data loss, you can either accept data loss with the `--accept-data-loss` option or stop the process. There is no way to customize the changes.

See [Schema prototyping with `db push`](/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/prototyping-your-schema) for an example of how to use `db push` in this way.

`db push` is **not recommended** if:

- You want to replicate your schema changes in other environments without losing data. You can use `db push` for prototyping, but you should use migrations to commit the schema changes and apply these in your other environments.
- You want fine-grained control over how the schema changes are executed - for example, [renaming a column instead of dropping it and creating a new one](/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/customizing-migrations#example-rename-a-field).
- You want to keep track of changes made to the database schema over time. `db push` does not create any artifacts that allow you to keep track of these changes.
- You want the schema changes to be reversible. You can use `db push` again to revert to the original state, but this might result in data loss.

## Can I use Prisma Migrate and <inlinecode>db push</inlinecode> together?

Yes, you can [use `db push` and Prisma Migrate together in your development workflow](/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/prototyping-your-schema) . For example, you can:

- Use `db push` to prototype a schema at the start of a project and initialize a migration history when you are happy with the first draft
- Use `db push` to prototype a change to an existing schema, then run `prisma migrate dev` to generate a migration from your changes (you will be asked to reset)

## Prototyping a new schema

The following scenario demonstrates how to use `db push` to synchronize a new schema with an empty database, and evolve that schema - including what happens when `db push` detects that a change will result in data loss.

1.  Create a first draft of your schema:

    ```prisma
    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }
    
    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }
    
    model User {
      id       Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      name     String
      jobTitle String
      posts    Post[]
      profile  Profile?
    }
    
    model Profile {
      id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
      biograpy String // Intentional typo!
      userId   Int    @unique
      user     User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
    }
    
    model Post {
      id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
      title      String
      published  Boolean    @default(true)
      content    String     @db.VarChar(500)
      authorId   Int
      author     User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
      categories Category[]
    }
    
    model Category {
      id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
      name  String @db.VarChar(50)
      posts Post[]
    
      @@unique([name])
    }
    ```

2.  Use `db push` to push the initial schema to the database:

    ```terminal
    npx prisma db push
    ```

3.  Create some example content:

    ```ts
    const add = await prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        name: 'Eloise',
        jobTitle: 'Programmer',
        posts: {
          create: {
            title: 'How to create a MySQL database',
            content: 'Some content',
          },
        },
      },
    })
    ```

4.  Make an additive change - for example, create a new required field:

    ```prisma highlight=6;add
    // ... //
    
    model Post {
      id          Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
      title       String
      description String
      published   Boolean    @default(true)
      content     String     @db.VarChar(500)
      authorId    Int
      author      User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
      categories  Category[]
    }
    
    // ... //
    ```

5.  Push the changes:

    ```terminal
    npx prisma db push
    ```

    `db push` will prompt you to reset because you cannot add a required field to a table with existing content unless you provide a default value:

    ```bash
    ⚠️ We found changes that cannot be executed:

    • Added the required column `description` to the `Post` table without a default value. There are 2 rows in this table, it is not possible to execute this.

    ? To apply this step we need to reset the database, do you want to continue? All data will be lost. » (y/N)
    ```

<Tip>

Use the `--accept-data-loss` flag to skip this warning, or `--force-reset` to ignore all warnings.

</Tip>

6.  Confirm data loss and apply changes to your database (or revisit your schema):

    ```bash
     There might be data loss when applying the changes:

     • Added the required column `description` to the `Post` table without a default value.

     ? Do you want to ignore the warning(s)? Some data will be lost. » (y/N)
    ```

    > **Note**: Unlike Prisma Migrate, `db push` does not generate migrations that you can modify to preserve data, and is therefore best suited for prototyping in a development environment.

7.  Continue to evolve your schema until it reaches a relatively stable state.

8.  Initialize a migration history:

    ```terminal
    npx prisma migrate dev --name initial-state
    ```

    The steps taken to reach the initial prototype are not preserved - `db push` does not generate a history.

9.  Push your migration history and Prisma schema to source control (e.g. Git).

At this point, the final draft of your prototyping is preserved in a migration and can be pushed to other environments (testing, production, or other members of your team).

## Prototyping with an existing migration history

The following scenario demonstrates how to use `db push` to prototype a change to a Prisma schema where a migration history already exists.

1. Check out the latest Prisma schema and migration history:

   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }
   
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   
   model User {
     id       Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     name     String
     jobTitle String
     posts    Post[]
     profile  Profile?
   }
   
   model Profile {
     id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
     biograpy String // Intentional typo!
     userId   Int    @unique
     user     User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
   }
   
   model Post {
     id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
     title      String
     published  Boolean    @default(true)
     content    String     @db.VarChar(500)
     authorId   Int
     author     User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
     categories Category[]
   }
   
   model Category {
     id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
     name  String @db.VarChar(50)
     posts Post[]
   
     @@unique([name])
   }
   ```

2. Prototype your new feature, which can involve any number of steps. For example, you might:

   - Create a `tags String[]` field, then run `db push`
   - Change the field type to `tags Tag[]` and add a new model named `Tag`, then run `db push`
   - Change your mind and restore the original `tags String[]` field, then call `db push`
   - Make a manual change to the `tags` field in the database - for example, adding a constraint

   After experimenting with several solutions, the final schema change looks like this:

   ```prisma
   model Post {
     id          Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
     title       String
     description String
     published   Boolean    @default(true)
     content     String     @db.VarChar(500)
     authorId    Int
     author      User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
     categories  Category[]
     tags        String[]
   }
   ```

3. To create a migration that adds the new `tags` field, run the `migrate dev` command:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev --name added-tags
   ```

   Prisma Migrate will prompt you to reset because the changes you made manually and with `db push` while prototyping are not part of the migration history:

   ```bash
   √ Drift detected: Your database schema is not in sync with your migration history.

   We need to reset the PostgreSQL database "prototyping" at "localhost:5432".
   Do you want to continue? All data will be lost. ... yes
   ```

4. Prisma Migrate replays the existing migration history, generates a new migration based on your schema changes, and applies those changes to the database.

<Tip>

When using `migrate dev`, if your schema changes mean that seed scripts will no longer work, you can use the `--skip-seed` flag to ignore seed scripts.

</Tip>

At this point, the final result of your prototyping is preserved in a migration, and can be pushed to other environments (testing, production, or other members of your team).
