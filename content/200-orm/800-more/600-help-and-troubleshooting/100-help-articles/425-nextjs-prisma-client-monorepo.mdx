## Problem

If you use Prisma Client in a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application within a monorepo, you may run into an error that looks similar to:

```terminal no-copy wrap
Prisma Client could not locate the Query Engine for runtime "debian-openssl-3.0.x".

We detected that you are using Next.js, learn how to fix this: https://pris.ly/d/engine-not-found-nextjs.

This is likely caused by tooling that has not copied "libquery_engine-debian-openssl-3.0.x.so.node" to the deployment folder.
Ensure that you ran \`prisma generate\` and that "libquery_engine-debian-openssl-3.0.x.so.node" has been copied to "generated/client".

We would appreciate if you could take the time to share some information with us.

or:

```terminal no-copy wrap
Prisma Client could not locate the Query Engine for runtime "debian-openssl-3.0.x".

We detected that you are using Next.js, learn how to fix this: https://pris.ly/d/engine-not-found-nextjs.

This is likely caused by a bundler that has not copied "libquery_engine-debian-openssl-3.0.x.so.node" next to the resulting bundle.
Ensure that "libquery_engine-debian-openssl-3.0.x.so.node" has been copied next to the bundle or in "generated/client".

Assume you have a monorepo with the following structure:

```
.
├── packages
│   ├── db
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   ├── node_modules
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── prisma
│   │       ├── client // <-- Custom output location for the generated Prisma Client
│   │       │   ├── index.js
│   │       │   ├── libquery_engine-debian-openssl-1.1.x.so.node // engine to be copied
│   │       │   └── schema.prisma // schema to be copied
│   │       └── schema.prisma
│   └── service/
│       ├── pages/
│       │   └── api/
│       │       └── test.js
│       ├── next.config.js
│       └── package.json
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── package.json
└── vercel.json
```

The file tree above shows a monorepo contained in a `packages` folder. Inside, there are two packages:

- `db`: Contains the generated Prisma Client in a custom output location named `client`. `index.ts` at the root of this package exports the instantiated Prisma Client.
- `service`: Contains a Next.js application. The `test.js` API route uses the Prisma Client instance provided by the `db` package.

The errors mentioned above occur as a result of a bundling problem during Next.js's bundling process. The Query Engine file(s) is expected to be found next to the generated Prisma Client. The bundling process, however, does not copy over those files to the output location of the bundle.

For a more detailed explanation of exactly what is going wrong during the bundling process, please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/46070) we opened in the Next.js GitHub repository.

## Solution

To work around this issue, you can use a custom Webpack plugin we created that correctly copies the files Prisma Client needs to their correct location.

To use this plugin, first install the package:

```terminal copy
npm install -D @prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin
```

You can then import the plugin into your `next.config.js` file and use it in `config.plugins`. For example:

```js copy
const { PrismaPlugin } = require('@prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin')

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    if (isServer) {
      config.plugins = [...config.plugins, new PrismaPlugin()]
    }

    return config
  },
}
```
