## Problem

Many users have come across this warning while working with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) in development:

```
warn(prisma-client) There are already 10 instances of Prisma Client actively running.
```

There's a related [discussion](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/4399) and [issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5103) for the same.

In development, the command `next dev` clears Node.js cache on run. This in turn initializes a new `PrismaClient` instance each time due to hot reloading that creates a connection to the database. This can quickly exhaust the database connections as each `PrismaClient` instance holds its own connection pool.

## Solution

The solution in this case is to instantiate a single instance `PrismaClient` and save it on the [`globalThis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis) object. Then we keep a check to only instantiate `PrismaClient` if it's not on the `globalThis` object otherwise use the same instance again if already present to prevent instantiating extra `PrismaClient` instances.

```ts file=db.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prismaClientSingleton = () => {
  return new PrismaClient()
}

declare global {
  var prisma: undefined | ReturnType<typeof prismaClientSingleton>
}

const prisma = globalThis.prisma ?? prismaClientSingleton()

export default prisma

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalThis.prisma = prisma
```

You can extend Prisma Client using a Prisma Client extension by appending the `$extends` client method when instantiating Prisma Client as follows:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prismaClientSingleton = () => {
  return new PrismaClient().$extends({
    result: {
      user: {
        fullName: {
          needs: { firstName: true, lastName: true },
          compute(user) {
            return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
          },
        },
      },
    },
  })
}
```

After creating this file, you can now import the extended `PrismaClient` instance anywhere in your Next.js `pages` as follows:

```ts
// e.g. in `pages/index.tsx`
import prisma from './db'

export const getServerSideProps = async () => {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany()

  return { props: { posts } }
}
```

## Next.js caching

When using Next.js, you may run into an issue where [only stale data is returned from certain routes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/22934#discussioncomment-8374081). In these cases, it's important to [set the dynamic behavior of the route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic) to `"force-dynamic"` so data is correctly returned from your Prisma Client queries.

You can add `"force-dynamic"` like this:

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import prisma from './db'

export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest, response: NextResponse) {
  // your code would go here
}
```
