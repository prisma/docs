## Problem

When deploying a Next.js app, you may run into an issue where your queries are not updating or displaying the correct content. Or, you may find that it takes a long time for newly created objects to show up in your queries.

In these cases, you are most likely seeing data persisted in the [Next.js Data Cache](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache). Any `fetch` request has its result cached by default, leading to possibly unwanted results as Prisma uses `fetch` internally.

## Solution

To opt-out of the Next.js Data Cache, you can [disable caching for a specific route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic) using the `"force-dynamic"` config option so that up to date data is always returned and no caching happens.

You can add `"force-dynamic"` like this:

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import prisma from './db'

export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest, response: NextResponse) {
  // your code would go here
}
```
