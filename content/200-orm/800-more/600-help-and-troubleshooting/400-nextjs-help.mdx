## Best Practices for Using Prisma Client in Development

### Avoid Multiple Prisma Client Instances

When developing a Next.js application, one common issue is accidentally creating multiple instances of the Prisma Client. This often occurs due to Next.js’s hot-reloading feature in development.

#### Why This Happens

Next.js’s hot-reloading feature reloads modules frequently to reflect code changes instantly. However, this can lead to multiple instances of Prisma Client being created, which consumes resources and might cause unexpected behavior.

#### Recommended Solution

To avoid this, create a single Prisma Client instance by using a global variable:

```typescript
// lib/prisma.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient };

export const prisma =
  globalForPrisma.prisma || new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
```

Using this approach ensures that only one instance of Prisma Client exists, even during hot-reloading in development.

## Setting Up Prisma in a Monorepo

### Challenges of Using Prisma in Monorepos

Monorepos allow multiple projects to share code and dependencies, making them a popular choice for modern development. However, using Prisma in a monorepo can present challenges related to dependency resolution and schema management.

#### Key Issues

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Multiple packages in a monorepo might lead to conflicts if they use different Prisma versions.
2. **Schema Centralization**: Managing a single Prisma schema across multiple projects can be complex.

#### Best Practices for Monorepo Integration

- **Centralize the Prisma Schema**: Place the `schema.prisma` file in a shared package, such as `@myorg/db`, to ensure consistency.
- **Install Dependencies in the Root**: Avoid version conflicts by installing Prisma dependencies at the root of the monorepo.
- **Use NPM Scripts for Generation**:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prisma:generate": "prisma generate --schema=./packages/db/schema.prisma"
  }
}
```

This approach keeps your Prisma schema and generated client in sync across all projects in the monorepo.

## Dynamic Usage of Prisma Client in Next.js

### Handling Dynamic Scenarios

Dynamic use cases, such as working with tenant-specific databases, require additional consideration when using Prisma with Next.js.

#### Problem

Each tenant might have its own database, necessitating the creation of separate Prisma Clients at runtime. This can be complex in Next.js due to its hybrid rendering model.

#### Solution

Use a factory function to dynamically create Prisma Clients based on tenant-specific configurations:

```typescript
// lib/prismaDynamic.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

type TenantConfig = {
  databaseUrl: string;
};

export function createPrismaClient(config: TenantConfig): PrismaClient {
  return new PrismaClient({
    datasources: {
      db: {
        url: config.databaseUrl,
      },
    },
  });
}
```

Ensure that you manage the lifecycle of dynamically created Prisma Clients to avoid resource exhaustion.
