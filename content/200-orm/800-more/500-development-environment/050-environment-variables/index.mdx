An environment variable is a key value pair of string data that is stored on your machine's local environment. Refer to our [Environment variables reference documentation](/orm/reference/environment-variables-reference) for specific details.

Typically the name of the variable is uppercase, this is then followed by an equals sign then the value of the variable:

```env
MY_VALUE=prisma
```

The environment variable belongs to the environment where a process is running.

Taking the `TEMP` environment variable as an example, one can query its value to find where to store temporary files. This is a system environment variable and can be queried by any process or application running on the machine.

Any program can read and create these environment variables. They are a cheap and effective way to store simple information.

## How does Prisma use environment variables?

Prisma always reads environment variables from the system's environment.

When you initialize Prisma in your project with `prisma init`, it creates a convenience `.env` file for you to set your [`connection url`](/orm/reference/connection-urls) as an environment variable. When you use Prisma CLI or Prisma Client, the `.env` file content and the variables defined in it are added to the [`process.env` object](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processenv), where Prisma can read it and use it.

Looking to use more than one `.env` file? See [Using multiple `.env` files](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables/using-multiple-env-files) for information on how to setup and use multiple `.env` files in your application.

### Using environment variables in your code

If you want environment variables to be evaluated at runtime, you need to load them manually in your application code (for example, by using [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)):

```ts
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config() // Load the environment variables
console.log(`The connection URL is ${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`)
```
