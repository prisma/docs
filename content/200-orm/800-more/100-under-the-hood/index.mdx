This page gives an overview of the Prisma ORM internals and how it works "under the hood".

Note that **this page does not contain any practical information that is relevant for _using_ Prisma ORM**. It rather aims at providing a _mental model_ for what the Prisma ORM toolkit _actually_ is and how the different tools that are available to developers are structured.

If you're new to using Prisma ORM, be sure to check out the [Quickstart](/getting-started/prisma-orm/quickstart/sqlite) and [Introduction](/orm/overview/introduction/what-is-prisma) pages first.
