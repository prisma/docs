For developers using AI Agents, we have a [migration prompt](/ai/prompts/prisma-7) that you can
add to your project for automatic migrations. 


:::info

If you are using MongoDB, please note that Prisma ORM v7 does not yet support MongoDB. You should continue using Prisma ORM v6 for now. Support for MongoDB is coming soon in v7.

## Upgrade the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` packages to v7

To upgrade to Prisma ORM v7 from an earlier version, you need to update both the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` packages:

<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="npm">

```terminal
npm install @prisma/client@7
npm install -D prisma@7
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```terminal
yarn up prisma@7 @prisma/client@7
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm">

```terminal
pnpm upgrade prisma@7 @prisma/client@7
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bun">

```terminal
bun add @prisma/client@7
bun add prisma@7 --dev
```

</TabItem>

## Breaking changes

This section gives an overview of breaking changes in Prisma ORM v7.

### Minimum supported Node.js & TypeScript versions

|            | Minimum Version | Recommended |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Node       | 20.19.0         | 22.x        |
| TypeScript | 5.4.0           | 5.9.x       |

### ESM support 
Prisma ORM now ships as an ES module, the module format supported in Bun, Deno, and Node. Set the
`type` field in your `package.json` to `module`

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {...},
}
```

If you are using TypeScript, you need to configure your `tsconfig.json` to be able to consume ES modules

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "target": "ES2023",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```


### Prisma schema changes

The older `prisma-client-js` provider will be removed in future releases of Prisma ORM. Upgrade to
the new `prisma-client` provider which uses the new Rust-free client. This will give you faster
queries, smaller bundle size, and require less system resources when deployed to your server.

Additionally, the `output` field is now **required** in the generator block. Prisma Client will no longer be generated in `node_modules` by default. You must specify a custom output path.

#### Before
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  engineType = "binary"
}
```

#### After
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client"
  output   = "./generated/prisma"
}
```

After running `npx prisma generate`, you'll need to update your imports to use the new generated path:

```ts
// Before
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

// After
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma/client'
```

:::note

The import path depends on where you place your generated client. Adjust the path based on your `output` configuration and the location of the file you're importing from.

:::

Additionally other fields such as `url`, `directUrl`, and `shadowDatabaseUrl` in the `datasource` block are deprecated. You can configure them in the [Prisma Config](/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference).

If you were previously using `directUrl` to run migrations then you need to pass the `directUrl` value in the `url` field of `prisma.config.ts` instead as the connection string defined in `url` is used by Prisma CLI for migrations.

```ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import { defineConfig, env } from 'prisma/config'

export default defineConfig({
  datasource: {
    url: env('DATABASE_URL'),
    shadowDatabaseUrl: env('SHADOW_DATABASE_URL')
  },
})
```


### Driver adapters and client instantiation
The way to create a new Prisma Client has changed to require a driver adapter for all databases.
This change aligns with the move to make the main Prisma Client as lean and open as possible. For
instance, if you are using Prisma Postgres, you now need the `@prisma/adapter-pg` adapter. This also
means the signature for creating a new Prisma Client has changed slightly:

#### Before

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  datasources: {
    db: { url: process.env.DATABASE_URL },
  },
  datasourceUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
});
```

#### After

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma/client';
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg';

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ 
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
});
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter });
```

If you are using SQLite, you can use the `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma/client';
import { PrismaBetterSqlite3 } from '@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3';

const adapter = new PrismaBetterSqlite3({
  url: process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'file:./dev.db'
})

export const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

### Prisma Accelerate users upgrading from v6
If you used Prisma Accelerate (including Prisma Postgres' `prisma+postgres://` URLs) in v6, keep using the Accelerate URL with the Accelerate extension. Do **not** pass the Accelerate URL to a driver adapter—`PrismaPg` expects a direct database connection string and will fail with `prisma://` or `prisma+postgres://`.

1. Keep your Accelerate URL in `.env` (for example `DATABASE_URL="prisma://..."` or `prisma+postgres://...`).
2. You can point `prisma.config.ts` directly to that same Accelerate URL for CLI operations:
```ts file=prisma.config.ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import { defineConfig, env } from 'prisma/config'

export default defineConfig({
  schema: 'prisma/schema.prisma',
  datasource: {
    url: env('DATABASE_URL'),
  },
})
```
   - If you prefer a separate direct URL for migrations, you can still use `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` as above—but it's optional for Accelerate users.
3. Instantiate Prisma Client with the Accelerate URL and extension (no adapter):
```ts
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

export const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  accelerateUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
}).$extends(withAccelerate())
```
If you later switch away from Accelerate to direct TCP, provide the direct URL to the appropriate driver adapter (for example `PrismaPg`) instead of `accelerateUrl`.

### Explicit loading of environment variables
In Prisma ORM 7.0.0, environment variables are not loaded by default. Instead developers need to
explicitly load the variables when calling the `prisma` CLI. Libraries like [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) can be used to manage loading environment variables by reading the appropriate `.env` file.


<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="npm">

```terminal
npm install dotenv
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```terminal
yarn add dotenv
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm">

```terminal
pnpm add dotenv
```

</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

For bun users, no action is required as bun will automatically load `.env` files. 

### Prisma config is now used to configure the Prisma CLI

Prisma Config is now the default place for configuring how the Prisma CLI interacts with your
database. You now configure your database URL, schema location, migration output, and custom seed
scripts. 

:::info

The `prisma.config.ts` file should be placed at the **root of your project** (where your `package.json` is located).

:::

```ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import { defineConfig, env } from 'prisma/config'

export default defineConfig({
  // the main entry for your schema
  schema: 'prisma/schema.prisma',
  // where migrations should be generated
  // what script to run for "prisma db seed"
  migrations: {
    path: 'prisma/migrations',
    seed: 'tsx prisma/seed.ts',
  },
  // The database URL 
  datasource: {
    // Type Safe env() helper 
    // Does not replace the need for dotenv
    url: env('DATABASE_URL'),
  },
})
```



### Metrics has been removed from the Client extensions

The Metrics preview feature was deprecated in [Prisma ORM 6.14.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.14.0) and has been removed for Prisma ORM 7.0.0. 
If you need this feature, you can use the underlying driver adapter for your database, or Client Extensions to make this information available.

For example, a basic `totalQueries` counter: 

```ts
const total = 0
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  client: {
    $log: (s: string) => console.log(s),
    async $totalQueries() { return total; },
  },
  query: {
      $allModels: {
        async $allOperations({ query, args }) {
          total += 1;
          return query(args);
        },
      },
    },
})

async function main() {
  prisma.$log('Hello world')
  const totalQueries = await prisma.$totalQueries()
  console.log(totalQueries)
}
```

### Client middleware has been removed

The client middleware API has been removed. If possible, use [Client Extensions](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions). 

```ts
// ❌ Old (removed)
prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
  // middleware logic
  return next(params)
})
// ✅ New (use extensions)
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      async findMany({ args, query }) {
        // extension logic
        return query(args)
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Automatic seeding during migrations has been removed

In Prisma ORM v6 and earlier, running `prisma migrate dev` or `prisma migrate reset` would automatically execute your seed script after applying migrations. This automatic seeding behavior has been removed in Prisma ORM v7.

To seed your database in v7, you must explicitly run:

```terminal
npx prisma db seed
```

### CLI flags `--skip-generate` and `--skip-seed` removed

The `--skip-generate` flag was removed from `prisma migrate dev` and `prisma db push`. The `--skip-seed` flag was removed from `prisma migrate dev`. 

`migrate dev` and `db push` no longer run `prisma generate` automatically. You must run `prisma generate` explicitly to generate Prisma Client.

### Various environment variables have been removed

We've removed a small selection of Prisma-specific environment variables. 

- `PRISMA_CLI_QUERY_ENGINE_TYPE`
- `PRISMA_CLIENT_ENGINE_TYPE`
- `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY`
- `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY`
- `PRISMA_GENERATE_SKIP_AUTOINSTALL`
- `PRISMA_SKIP_POSTINSTALL_GENERATE`
- `PRISMA_GENERATE_IN_POSTINSTALL`
- `PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY`
- `PRISMA_GENERATE_NO_ENGINE`
- `PRISMA_CLIENT_NO_RETRY`
- `PRISMA_MIGRATE_SKIP_GENERATE`
- `PRISMA_MIGRATE_SKIP_SEED`
