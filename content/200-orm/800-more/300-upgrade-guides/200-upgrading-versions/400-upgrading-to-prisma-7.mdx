## Upgrade the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` packages to v7

To upgrade to Prisma ORM v7 from an earlier version, you need to update both the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` packages:

<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="npm">

```terminal
npm install @prisma/client@7
npm install -D prisma@7
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```terminal
yarn up prisma@7 @prisma/client@7
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm">

```terminal
pnpm upgrade prisma@7 @prisma/client@7
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bun">

```terminal
bun add @prisma/client@7
bun add prisma@7 --dev
```

## Breaking changes

This section gives an overview of breaking changes in Prisma ORM v7.

### Minimum supported Node.js & TypeScript versions

|            | Minimum Version | Recommended |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Node       | 20.19.0         | 22.x        |
| TypeScript | 5.4.0           | 5.9.x       |

### ESM Support 
Prisma ORM now ships as an ES module, module format supported in Bun, Deno, and Node. Set the
`type` field in your `package.json` to `module`

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {...},
}
```

If you are using TypeScript, you need to configure your `tsconfig.json` to be able to consume ES modules

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "target": "ES2023",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```


### Prisma Schema Changes

The older `prisma-client-js` provider will be removed in future releases of Prisma ORM. Upgrade to
the new `prisma-client` provider which uses the new Rust-free client. This will give you faster
queries, smaller bundle size, and require less system resources when deployed to your server.


#### Before
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  engineType = "binary"
}
```

#### After
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client"
}
```

Additionally other fields such as `url`, `directUrl`, and `shadowDatabaseUrl` in the `datasource` block are deprecated and now part of the [Prisma Config](/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference)


### Driver Adapters and Client Instantiation
The way to create a new Prisma Client has changed to require a driver adapter for all databases.
This change aligns with the move to make the main Prisma Clinet as lean and open as possible. For
instance, if you are using Prisma Postgres, you now need the `@prisma/adapter-pg` adapter. This also
means the signature for creating a new Prisma Client has changed slightly:

#### Before

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  datasources: {
    db: { url: process.env.DATABASE_URL },
  },
  datasourceUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
});
```

#### After

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma/client.js';
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg';

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ 
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
});
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter });
```

If you are using SQLite, you can use the `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma/client.js';
import { PrismaBetterSQLite3 } from '@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3';

const adapter = new PrismaBetterSQLite3({
  url: process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'file:./dev.db'
})

export const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

### Explicit loading of Environment Variables
In Prisma ORM 7.0.0, environment variables are not loaded by default. Instead developers need to
explicitly load the variables when calling the `prisma` CLI. Libraries like [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) can be used to manage loading environment variables by reading the appropriate `.env` file.


<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="npm">

```terminal
npm install dotenv
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```terminal
yarn add dotenv
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm">

```terminal
pnpm add dotenv
```

</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

For bun users, no action is required as bun will automatically load `.env` files. 

### Prisma Config is now used to configure the Prisma CLI

Prisma Config is now the default place for configuring how the Prisma CLI interacts with your
database. You now configure your database URL, schema location, migration output, and custom seed
scripts. 

```ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import { defineConfig, env } from 'prisma/config'

export default defineConfig({
  // the main entry for your scheam
  schema: 'prisma/schema.prisma',
  // where migrations should be generated
  // what script to run for "prisma db seed"
  migrations: {
    path: 'prisma/migrations',
    seed: 'tsx prisma/seed.ts',
  },
  // The database URL 
  datasource: {
    // Type Safe env() helper 
    // Does not replace the need for dotenv
    url: env('DATABASE_URL'),
  },
})
```



### Metrics has been removed from the Client extensions

The Metrics preview feature was deprecated in [Prisma ORM 6.14.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.14.0) and has been removed for Prisma ORM 7.0.0. 
If you need this feature, use the underlying driver adapter for the database you are using and
incorporate Client extensions to expose that information.

### Client Middleware has been removed

The client middleware API has been removed in favor of using
[Extensions](orm/prisma-client/client-extensions). 

```ts
// ❌ Old (removed)
prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
  // middleware logic
  return next(params)
})
// ✅ New (use extensions)
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      async findMany({ args, query }) {
        // extension logic
        return query(args)
      }
    }
  }
})
```
