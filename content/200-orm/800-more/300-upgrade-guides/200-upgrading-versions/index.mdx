To upgrade to the latest version of Prisma:

1. Review [release notes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases) on GitHub for breaking changes and new features.
1. Upgrade **both** of the following packages to the same version:

   - [`prisma`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma)
   - [`@prisma/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/client)

1. Upgrade your codebase where applicable. Breaking changes may require you to change your Prisma schema or the way you use Prisma Client.

<Tip>

[codemods](codemods) help you refactor your code to account for breaking changes - for example, the 2.12.0 codemod automatically renames `findOne` to `findUnique`.

## Testing new features, without upgrading

### <inlinecode>dev</inlinecode> distribution tag

The `dev` [Npm distribution tag](http://npm.github.io/publishing-pkgs-docs/updating/using-tags.html) points to the most recent development version of the package, which is published for each commit to the main branch of `prisma/prisma`. You can use the `dev` distribution tag to verify a fix or test a feature before it is officially released.

To install the latest `dev` distribution tag:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/client@dev prisma@dev
```

<Admonition type="alert">

Do not use the `dev` distribution tag in production - wait until the official release that contains the features and fixes you are interested in is released. For example, fixes present `@prisma/client@2.23.0-dev.25` will eventually be released as part of `@prisma/client@2.23.0`.
