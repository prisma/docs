### Full-text search on PostgreSQL

The `fullTextSearch` Preview feature is promoted to General Availability only for MySQL. This means that if you're using PostgreSQL and currently make use of this Preview feature, you now need to use the new `fullTextSearchPostgres` Preview feature:

#### Before

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  // edit-next-line
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch"]
}
```

#### After

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  // edit-next-line
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearchPostgres"]
}
```

### `tracing`

If you use the [OpenTelemetry tracing](/orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/opentelemetry-tracing#about-tracing) in your app, you can now remove `tracing` from the `previewFeatures` in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  // delete-next-line
  previewFeatures = ["tracing"]
}
```

### `fullTextIndex`

If you use the [full-text index](/orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/opentelemetry-tracing#about-tracing) feature in your app, you can now remove `fullTextIndex` from the `previewFeatures` in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  // delete-next-line
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextIndex"]
}
```

### `fullTextSearch`

If you use the [full-text search](/orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/opentelemetry-tracing#about-tracing) feature with **MySQL** in your app, you can now remove `fullTextSearch` from the `previewFeatures` in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  // delete-next-line
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch"]
}
```

If you are using it with **PostgreSQL**, you need to update the name of the feature flag to `fullTextSearchPostgres`:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  // edit-next-line
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearchPostgres"]
}
```
