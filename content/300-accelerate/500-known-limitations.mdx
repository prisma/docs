Below are descriptions of known limitations when using Accelerate. If you encounter any additional ones, please share them with us via [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord).

## Cannot cache raw queries

At the moment, it is not possible to cache the responses of [raw queries](/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/raw-queries).

## Not compatible with the fluent API

Client Extensions (which are used in Accelerate) currently do not correctly forward the [fluent API](/orm/prisma-client/queries/relation-queries#fluent-api) types. We hope to get a fix into Client Extensions soon.
