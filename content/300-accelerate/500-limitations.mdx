Below are descriptions of known limitations when using Accelerate. If you encounter any additional ones, please share them with us via [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord).

</TopBlock>

## Query timeout limit

Accelerate has a global timeout of `10s` for each query. Reach out to [support@prisma.io](mailto:support@prisma.io) with your use case if your application requires a greater timeout value.

> Also see the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/troubleshoot#p6004-querytimeout) for more information.

## Interactive transactions query timeout limit

Accelerate has a global timeout of `15s` for each [interactive transaction](/orm/prisma-client/queries/transactions#interactive-transactions). Reach out to [support@prisma.io](mailto:support@prisma.io) with your use case if your application requires a greater timeout value.

## Response size limit

Accelerate has a global response size limit of `5MB`. Reach out to [support@prisma.io](mailto:support@prisma.io) with your use case if your application requires a larger response size.

> Also see the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/troubleshoot#p6009-responsesizelimitexceeded) for more information.

## Cannot cache raw queries

At the moment, it is not possible to cache the responses of [raw queries](/orm/prisma-client/queries/raw-database-access/raw-queries).

## Not compatible with the fluent API

Client Extensions (which are used in Accelerate) currently do not correctly forward the [fluent API](/orm/prisma-client/queries/relation-queries#fluent-api) types. We hope to get a fix into Client Extensions soon.
