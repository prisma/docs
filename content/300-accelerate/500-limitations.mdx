Below are descriptions of known limitations when using Accelerate. If you encounter any additional ones, please share them with us via [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord).

</TopBlock>

## Query timeout limit

Accelerate has a default global timeout of `10s` for each query that you can configure depending on your pricing plan:

| Plan     | Starter       | Pro          | Business      |
|----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Query timeout  | Up to 10 seconds | Up to 20 seconds | Up to 60 seconds |

See the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/troubleshoot#p6004-querytimeout) and our [pricing page](https://www.prisma.io/pricing#accelerate) for more information.

:::warning

Although you can increase the query timeout, we believe you should inspect and improve the performance of your database queries if it's longer than `10s` to reduce stress on your underlying database. Long-running queries often indicate a need for optimization. Learn more in the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/troubleshoot#p6004-querytimeout).

## Interactive transactions query timeout limit

Accelerate has a default global timeout of `15s` for each [interactive transaction](/orm/prisma-client/queries/transactions#interactive-transactions) that you can configure depending on your pricing plan:

| Plan                       | Starter       | Pro          | Business      |
|----------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Interactive transaction limit | Up to 15 seconds | Up to 30 seconds | Up to 90 seconds |

See the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/troubleshoot#p6004-querytimeout) and our [pricing page](https://www.prisma.io/pricing#accelerate) for more information.

:::warning

Although you can increase the interactive transaction timeout limit, we believe you should inspect and improve the performance of your database transactions if it's longer than `15s` to reduce stress on your underlying database. Long-running transactions can adversely impact database performance and indicate a need for optimization. Learn more in the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/troubleshoot#p6004-querytimeout) and see the [warning in the Interactive Transactions section](/orm/prisma-client/queries/transactions#interactive-transactions-1) in our docs.

## Response size limit

Accelerate has a default global response size limit of `5MB` that you can configure depending on your subscription plan:

| Plan     | Starter       | Pro          | Business      |
|----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Query size | Up to 5MB     | Up to 10MB   | Up to 20MB    |

See the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/troubleshoot#p6009-responsesizelimitexceeded) and our [pricing page](https://www.prisma.io/pricing#accelerate) for more information.

:::warning

Although you can increase the query response size, we believe you should retrieve only the data you need. This improves database performance, reduces stress on your database, and makes your frontend apps more responsive. Queries with large response sizes more than `5MB` often indicate a need for optimization. Learn more in the [troubleshooting guide](/accelerate/troubleshoot#p6009-responsesizelimitexceeded).

## Cannot cache raw queries

At the moment, it is not possible to cache the responses of [raw queries](/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/raw-queries).

## Not compatible with the fluent API

Client Extensions (which are used in Accelerate) currently do not correctly forward the [fluent API](/orm/prisma-client/queries/relation-queries#fluent-api) types. We hope to get a fix into Client Extensions soon.
