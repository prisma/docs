metaDescription: "Learn about everything you need to know to use Accelerate's connection pooling."
---

Accelerate provides built-in connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections. It's included as part of [Prisma Postgres](/postgres), but you can also use it with your own database by enabling Accelerate in the [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io?utm_source=docs) and [connecting it to your database](/accelerate/getting-started).
This page has moved, connection pooling in Prisma Accelerate is now documented in the [Prisma Postgres section](/postgres/database/connection-pooling).
