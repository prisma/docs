:::info

A [connection pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool#:~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20a%20connection,executing%20commands%20on%20a%20database.) is a storage of database connections that can be reused for future requests to the database. When a new connection is requested, it is retrieved from the pool if one is available. Once the connection is no longer needed, it is returned to the pool for reuse.

[Connection pooling](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/database-tools/connection-pooling) is important as it allows you to reuse existing connections instead of creating new ones, which can be an expensive operation.

Accelerate provides built-in connection pooling by default. By simply using Accelerate, you get the benefits of connection pooling without having to configure anything. The efficient management of database connections allows the database to process more queries without exhausting the available database connections, making your application more scalable. 

### Connection Pooling in Accelerate

By default, Accelerate has a default `connection_limit` of `10`. In some high traffic or compute environments, you may need to increase this value. You can do so by either [configuring the default connection pool size](#configuring-the-connection-pool-size) or by [enabling autoscaling for your Accelerate deployment](#autoscaling).

### Configuring the connection pool size

The connection pool size can be configured via the _database connection string_ in your Platform project (_not_ the Accelerate connection string in your Prisma schema) via the `connection_limit` parameter. For example, set a connection pool size of `10` like this: `postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?connection_limit=10`.

If nothing is configured, a default value will be used.

To change the size of the connection pool:
1. Open the [Console](https://console.prisma.io/login).
1. Select the _project_ in which you're using Accelerate. You might need to select a different _workspace_ if you can't see your project.
1. Select the _environment_ where you want to configure Accelerate's connection pool size.
1. Update the connection string by appending the `connection_limit` argument.

### Autoscaling

With the Pro and Business plans of the Prisma Data Platform, you can enable autoscaling for your Accelerate deployment. This allows Accelerate to scale up or down to multiple instances based on the traffic to your application. Each Accelerate instance will hold a maximum of 10 connections. If you increase your `connection_limit` and have autoscaling enabled, Accelerate will scale up to handle the increased traffic.

Specifically, Accelerate will begin allocating new instances when you have consistent usage greater than 90% of your currently alloted connections across all Accelerate instances. If traffic continues to increase, Accelerate will scale up further. If traffic decreases, Accelerate will scale down.

### Configuring the connection pool timeout

The connection pool timeout is the maximum number of seconds that a query will block while waiting for a connection from Accelerate's internal connection pool. This occurs if the number of concurrent requests exceeds the connection limit, resulting in queueing of additional requests until a free connection becomes available. An exception is thrown if a free connection does not become available within the pool timeout. The connection pool timeout can be disabled by setting the value to 0.

Similar to the connection pool size, you may also configure the connection pool timeout via the _database connection string_. To adjust this value, you may add the `pool_timeout` parameter to the database connection string.

For example:

```env no-copy
postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db?connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=20
```
