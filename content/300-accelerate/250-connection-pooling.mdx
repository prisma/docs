:::info

To learn more about connection pooling generally, be sure to check out [Prisma's Data Guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/database-tools/connection-pooling) for a comprehensive overview on what connection pooling is, what it seeks to address, and how it works.

:::

Accelerate provides built-in connection pooling by default. By using Accelerate, you get the benefits of connection pooling without having to configure anything. The efficient management of database connections allows the database to process more queries without exhausting the available database connections, making your application more scalable.

In some cases, however, it may be beneficial to further configure connection pooling in order to optimize the performance of your application.

:::note

This document focuses on the connection pooling features of Prisma Accelerate. For more information about the internal connection pool of Prisma ORM specifically, see our [ORM connection pooling documentation](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/connection-pool).

### Connection Pooling in Accelerate

By default, Accelerate has a connection limit of `10`. This means that Prisma Accelerate will open at most 10 database connections to your database per Prisma Schema used in Accelerate. For the Starter plan, this is also the maximum connection limit.

In most cases, this connection limit is sufficient. However, in high traffic or heavy compute environments, you may need to [increase this value](#configuring-the-connection-pool-size). If your project is on the [Pro plan](https://prisma.io/pricing), the maximum connection limit is `100`. For [Business plan](https://prisma.io/pricing) projects the maximum is `1000`.

### Configuring the connection pool size

When not using Prisma Accelerate, you can configure the connection pool of Prisma ORM [via the connection string](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/connection-pool#setting-the-connection-pool-size). When using Prisma Accelerate *this feature is not available*. Instead, you can configure the connection pool size in your Platform project via the `Connection limit` setting [on Accelerate setup](/accelerate/getting-started).

#### Autoscaling

Autoscaling allows Accelerate to dynamically allocate resources based on your application's traffic. As consistent usage approaches the current connection limit, Accelerate will begin allocating new resources to handle the increased load. If traffic continues to rise, Accelerate will scale up further. Conversely, when traffic decreases, Accelerate will scale down accordingly.

Autoscaling is enabled when the Accelerate connection limit is set above the default value. This feature is not available on the Starter plan.

The maximum value of your Accelerate connection limit is based on your [Prisma Data Platform plan](https://prisma.io/pricing). 

| Plan       | Maximum Connection Limit             |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Starter    | 10                                   |
| Pro        | 100                                  |
| Business   | 1000                                 |

### Configuring the connection pool timeout

The connection pool timeout is the maximum number of seconds that a query will block while waiting for a connection from Accelerate's internal connection pool. This occurs if the number of concurrent requests exceeds the connection limit, resulting in queueing of additional requests until a free connection becomes available. An exception is thrown if a free connection does not become available within the pool timeout. The connection pool timeout can be disabled by setting the value to 0.

Similar to the connection pool size, you may also configure the connection pool timeout via the _database connection string_. To adjust this value, you may add the `pool_timeout` parameter to the database connection string.

For example:

```env no-copy
postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db?connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=20
```

The default value for `pool_timeout` is `10` seconds.
