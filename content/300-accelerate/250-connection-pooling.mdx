A [connection pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool#:~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20a%20connection,executing%20commands%20on%20a%20database.) is a storage of database connections that can be reused for future requests to the database. When a new connection is requested, it is retrieved from the pool if one is available. Once the connection is no longer needed, it is returned to the pool for reuse.

[Connection pooling](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/database-tools/connection-pooling) is important as it allows you to reuse existing connections instead of creating new ones, which can be an expensive operation. 

The efficient management of database connections allows the database to process more queries without exhausting the available database connections, making your application more scalable. 

Accelerate provides built-in connection pooling by default. By simply using Accelerate, you get the benefits of connection pooling without having to configure anything. However, you can also configure the connection pool to suit your needs.

### Default connection pool size

Accelerate has a default `connection_limit` set to `10`.

### Configuring the connection pool size

The connection pool size can be configured via the _database connection string_ in your Platform project (_not_ the Accelerate connection string in your Prisma schema) via the `connection_limit` parameter. For example, set a connection pool size of `10` like this: `postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?connection_limit=10`.

If nothing is configured, a default value will be used.

To change the size of the connection pool:
1. Open the [Console](https://console.prisma.io/).
1. Select the _project_ in which you're using Accelerate. You might need to select a different _workspace_ if you can't see your project.
1. Select the _environment_ where you want to configure Accelerate's connection pool size.
1. Update the connection string by appending the `connection_limit` argument.

### Configuring the connection pool timeout

The connection pool timeout is the maximum number of seconds that Accelerate's internal connection pool waits for a new connection to your database to succeed and open. If the connection is not opened within this time frame, an exception is thrown. A value of 0 means there is no timeout.

Similar to the connection pool size, you may also configure the connection pool timeout via the _database connection string_. To adjust this value, you may add the `pool_timeout` parameter to the database connection string.

For example:

```env no-copy
postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db?connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=20
```

The default value for `pool_timeout` is `10` seconds.
