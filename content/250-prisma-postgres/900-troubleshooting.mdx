This guide helps resolve common issues when working with Prisma Postgres.

## `prisma init --db` command is not working

### Problem

Running the following command fails:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db
```

### Cause

This issue occurs due to npx caching. If you've previously run `npx prisma init`, it may be using an outdated cached version that doesn't recognize the `--db` flag.

### Solution

Instead of running the standard command, explicitly fetch the latest Prisma CLI version:

```terminal
npx prisma@latest init --db
```

This ensures that you're using the most up-to-date CLI, preventing issues with outdated command syntax.
