You can view and edit your data in Prisma Postgres® using either [Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio) or 3rd party database editors.

## Viewing and editing data in Prisma Studio

With Prisma Postgres, a hosted version of [Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio) is available for you in of your project. In your project environment in the [Platform Console](https://console.prisma.io/), select the **Studio** tab in the left-hand navigation to view and edit your data:

You can also run Prisma Studio locally by running:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

This should start a live server in `http://localhost:5555` where you can visit and interact with your database.

## Connecting to Prisma Postgres instance with third party database editors

You can connect to your Prisma Postgres instance using third party database editors like pgAdmin, TablePlus, Postico etc using [`@prisma/ppg-tunnel` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/ppg-tunnel). See the example below to connect using TablePlus.

### 1. Create a TCP tunnel to access Prisma Postgres directly

In your terminal export the env variable `DATABASE_URL` referring to your Prisma Postgres instance which you want to connect to.

<TabItem value="MacOS">
```terminal
export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Linux">
```terminal
export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows">

```cmd
set DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
```
</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

Run the following command to connect to your Prisma Postgres instance via `@prisma/ppg-tunnel` package:

```terminal
npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5432
```

You should see output similar to:

```terminal
Prisma Postgres auth proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:5432 🚀

Your connection is authenticated using your Prisma Postgres API key.
...

==============================
hostname:  127.0.0.1
port:      5432
username:  <anything>
password:  <none>
==============================
```

Keep this tunnel process running while you are using the database editor to maintain the connection.

### 2. Connect to Prisma Postgres using TablePlus

Based on the database editor you are using, you can connect to your Prisma Postgres instance using the details you obtained from the output of the `@prisma/ppg-tunnel` package. To add the connection string in TablePlus:

1. Open TablePlus and click on the `+` icon to add a new connection.
2. Select `PostgreSQL` as the database type.
3. Enter the following details:
  - Name: Any name you want to give to your connection.
  - Host: `127.0.0.1` in this case. 
  - Port: The port number you obtained from the output of the `@prisma/ppg-tunnel` package.
  - User: You can provide any username here.
  - Password: Leave it empty as the connection is authenticated using the tunnel.
4. Click on `Connect` to connect to your Prisma Postgres instance.
