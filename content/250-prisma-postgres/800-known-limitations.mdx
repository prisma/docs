Here's a list of known limitations that Prisma Postgres currently has. 

### Same resource allocation regardless of pricing plan

It's not yet possible to configure the size and resource allocation of your Prisma Postgres instance. All instances will have the same [technical details](/prisma-postgres/#technical-details), regardless of the pricing plan you chose.

### Limited region support

Prisma Postgres will be gradually rolled out in new regions. If it is not yet available in your preferred region, you can simply subscribe to get notified when it becomes available by subscribing to notifications in the **Region** dropdown when setting up your Prisma Postgres instance in the Platform Console. We'll send you an email when new regions become available, so you can easily stay up to date.

### Fixed connection limit

Prisma Postgres currently has a fixed connection limit of 10 that cannot be adjusted. This is a temporary limitation during Early Access. Once Prisma Postgres reaches General Availability (GA), it will support configurable connection limits, enabling you to scale connections according to your needs.
