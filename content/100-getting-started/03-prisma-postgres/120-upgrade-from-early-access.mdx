This guide shows you how to migrate your Prisma Postgres Early Access (EA) database to the now official Prisma Postgres General Availability (GA) database. Prisma Postgres Early Access was introduced to allow early adopters to test Prisma‚Äôs new managed PostgreSQL service. As we move to GA, it's crucial to safely migrate data from your EA database to the new GA database.

Prisma will _not_ automatically migrate your data to ensure its integrity. Instead, this process must be done manually. You can accomplish this in three main steps:

1. Back up your EA database via `pg_dump`.
2. Create a new GA database.
3. Import your backup into the GA database via `pg_restore`.

We will be using the [`@prisma/ppg-tunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/ppg-tunnel) package to securely connect to both databases. This tool sets up a secure proxy tunnel, eliminating the need for manual credential handling.

You can learn more about **Prisma Postgres** on [this page](/postgres).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** installed (version 16 or higher).
- **PostgreSQL CLI Tools** (`pg_dump`, `pg_restore`) for creating and restoring backups.
- A **Database connection string** for your Prisma Postgres database.


## 1. Back up the EA database

### 1.1. Installing PostgreSQL utilities

To create and restore backups, ensure you have the PostgreSQL command-line tools installed. Run the following commands based on your operating system:

<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="macOS">

```terminal
brew install postgresql@16
which pg_dump
which pg_restore
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows">

```terminal
# Download from the official PostgreSQL website:
# https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
# During installation, select "Command Line Tools".
# Then verify with:

where pg_dump
where pg_restore
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Linux">

```terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client-16
which pg_dump
which pg_restore
```

</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

:::tip
If you installed PostgreSQL but still see a ‚Äúcommand not found‚Äù error for pg_dump or pg_restore, ensure your installation directory is in your system‚Äôs PATH environment variable.
:::

:::note
Please make sure that you are installing Postgresql version 16. Other versions may cause errors during the backup and restore process.
:::

### 1.2. Connecting to the EA database directly with `@prisma/ppg-tunnel`

In your terminal, run `npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel` to establish a secure tunnel to your Early Access database.

If you already have a `.env` file in your current directory with `DATABASE_URL` set, the tunnel CLI will automatically pick it up‚Äîno need to manually export it. However, if you haven't set up a `.env` file, you'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable explicitly.

To set environment variable (with your actual EA database URL):
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI..."
```
:::note
If you explicitly set `DATABASE_URL` in your terminal, that value will take precedence over the one in your `.env` file.
:::

Run the tunnel:
```bash
npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel --host 127.0.0.1  --port 5432
```

You should see output similar to:

```cmd
Prisma Postgres auth proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:5432 üöÄ

Your connection is authenticated using your Prisma Postgres API key.
...

==============================
hostname:  127.0.0.1
port:      5432
username:  <anything>
password:  <none>
==============================
```

:::note
Please note that the port you will see in your output will be a randomly assigned port which may be different from the one mentioned here.
Also, Keep this terminal window open so the tunnel remains active! If you close it, the tunnel disconnects.
:::

Copy the port number from the terminal output, you‚Äôll need it in the next step for the `pg_dump` command.

### 1.3. Creating the Backup with `pg_dump`

With the tunnel running, you can now dump the EA database by running the following command:
```bash
PGSSLMODE=disable \
pg_dump \
  -h 127.0.0.1 \
  -p 5432 \
  -Fc \
  -v \
  -d postgres \
  -f ./mydatabase.bak \
&& echo "-complete-"
```

`PGSSLMODE=disable` indicates SSL is not required locally because the tunnel already encrypts the connection.

```
`-h` is the host (127.0.0.1)
`-p` is the port, which should match the one from the tunnel output.
`-Fc` uses the custom format for backups, recommended for pg_restore.
`-d` postgres is the default database name used in Prisma Postgres.
`-f` ./mydatabase.bak specifies the backup file name and location.
`-v` runs pg_dump in verbose mode.
```

This should create your backup file named `mydatabase.bak` in the current directory. We will use this backup file for importing in next steps.

## 2. Create a new GA database

Next, create your GA (General Availability) database:
1.	Visit [console.prisma.io](https://console.prisma.io) and sign in (or create an account).
2.	Create a Prisma Postgres database in the region of your choice.
3.	Copy the Database URL for later use.

Prisma Postgres GA uses PostgreSQL 17, so you‚Äôll be restoring your EA backup into this new environment.

## 3. Import the backup into the GA database

### 3.1. Connecting to the GA Database with `@prisma/ppg-tunnel`

Open a new terminal (or stop the previous tunnel) and connect to your GA database:

Set environment variables for the new GA database:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI..."
```

Run the tunnel:
```bash
npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5432
```

You should see output similar to:

```cmd
Prisma Postgres auth proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:52604 üöÄ

Your connection is authenticated using your Prisma Postgres API key.
...

==============================
hostname:  127.0.0.1
port:      52604
username:  <anything>
password:  <none>
==============================
```


:::note
Again, keep this tunnel process running to maintain the connection!
:::

### 3.2. Restoring the Backup with `pg_restore`

Use the backup file from **Step 1** to restore data into your GA database with `pg_restore` by running this command:

```bash
PGSSLMODE=disable \
pg_restore \
  -h 127.0.0.1 \
  -p 5432 \
  -v \
  -d postgres \
  ./mydatabase.bak \
&& echo "-complete-"
```

Also, in this case the database name is `postgres`. You can replace it with your desired database name. It does not matter what you name your database as you will be able to use Prisma Postgres as usual.
The backup file name (mydatabase.bak in our example) should match the one you created in Step 1.

This command restores the backup into the GA database. If successful, you should see `-complete-` in the terminal.

## Next steps

Connect with your favorite Database IDE or Prisma Client to confirm all tables, rows, and schemas match your old EA environment.

Congratulations! You have successfully migrated your Prisma Postgres Early Access database to Prisma Postgres GA. If you encounter any issues, please reach out to our [support team](https://www.prisma.io/support).
