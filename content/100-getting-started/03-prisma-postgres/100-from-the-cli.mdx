This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a project with [Prisma Postgres](/prisma-postgres) database from the CLI using the `prisma init --db` command.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have run the `prisma init --db` command to initialize Prisma with a [Prisma Postgres](/prisma-postgres) database:

```terminal
npx prisma@latest init --db
```

After the command runs successfully, the following actions take place:

- You'll be logged into Prisma Data Platform.
- A new Prisma project is created.
- A connection to Prisma Postgres is established and provisioned.
- The `prisma/` folder is created with a `schema.prisma` file.
- A `.env` file is generated with a `DATABASE_URL` pointing to Prisma Postgres.

The CLI output will look like similar to this:

```
Let's set up your Prisma Postgres database!
? Select your region: ap-northeast-1 - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
? Enter a project name: starter
Creating project starter...
Success! Project starter created

âœ” Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

Database URL:
prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key={API_KEY}

Project link:
{PROJECT_URL}
```

## 1. Organize your project directory

If you ran the `prisma init --db` command inside a folder where you want your project to live, you can skip this step and [proceed to the next section](/getting-started/prisma-postgres/from-the-cli#2-set-up-your-project).

If you ran the command outside your intended project directory (e.g., in your home folder or another location), you need to move the generated `prisma` folder and the `.env` file into a dedicated project folder.

Create a new folder (e.g. `hello-prisma`) where you want your project to live and move the necessary files into it:

```terminal
mkdir hello-prisma
mv .env ./hello-prisma/
mv prisma ./hello-prisma/
```

Navigate into your project folder:

```terminal
cd ./hello-prisma
```

Now that your project is in the correct location, continue with the setup.

## 2. Set up your project

Initialize a TypeScript project and add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency:

```terminal
npm init -y
npm install prisma typescript tsx @types/node --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` file with an initial setup for your TypeScript app.

Install the required dependency to use Prisma Postgres:

```terminal
npm i @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

Initialize TypeScript:

```terminal
npx tsc --init
```

This generates a `tsconfig.json` file.

Create an `index.ts` file in the root directory:

```terminal
touch index.ts
```

Update your `package.json` to include a script for running the application:

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    // add-next-line
    "start": "tsx index.ts"
  },
  // ...
}
```

## 3. Define models and migrate the database

Update your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to include a simple `User` model:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String @unique
}
```

After adding the model, migrate your database using [Prisma Migrate](/orm/prisma-migrate):

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## 4. Seed the database

Create a `seed.ts` file inside the `prisma` folder:

```terminal
touch prisma/seed.ts
```

Next, add the following code to it to populate the database with initial data:

```ts file=prisma/seed.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

async function main() {
  await prisma.user.createMany({
    data: [
      { name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" },
      { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" }
    ],
  });
  console.log("Seeded database with initial users");
}

main()
  .catch((e) => console.error(e))
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
```

Add a `seed` script inside `prisma` object to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "start": "tsx index.ts"
  },
  // add-start
  "prisma": {
    "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
  },
  // add-end
  // ...
}

```

Run the seed script:

```terminal
npx prisma db seed
```

## 5. Create a simple TypeScript application

In your `index.ts` file, add the following code to query your database:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

async function main() {
  // Fetch all users
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  console.log("All users:", users);

  // Count users
  const userCount = await prisma.user.count();
  console.log("Total users count:", userCount);
}

main()
  .catch((e) => console.error(e))
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
```

## 6. Run the application

Execute the script using:

```terminal
npm start
```

If you previously ran the seed script, you should see output similar to:

```terminal
All users: [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' }
]
Total users count: 2
```

This confirms that the Prisma client is successfully interacting with the database.

## 7. Interact with the data using Prisma Studio

Use [Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio) to interact with and view your data in a GUI:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

This starts a GUI available at [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555).

You can also use database editors like [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) and [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to interact with your database. For more details, visit [this page](/prisma-postgres).

## Next steps

You just got your feet wet with a basic Prisma Postgres setup. If you want to explore more complex queries, caching and real-time functionality, check out the official [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-prismaPostgres).

### Explore the data in Prisma Studio

Prisma ORM comes with a built-in GUI to view and edit the data in your database. You can open it using the following command:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

With Prisma Postgres, you can also directly use Prisma Studio inside the [Console](https://console.prisma.io) by selecting the **Studio** tab in your project.

### Explore ready-to-run Prisma ORM examples

Check out the [`prisma-examples`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/) repository on GitHub to see how Prisma ORM can be used with your favorite library. The repo contains examples with Express, NestJS, GraphQL as well as fullstack examples with Next.js and Vue.js, and a lot more.

These examples use SQLite by default but you can follow the instructions in the project README to switch to Prisma Postgres in a few simple steps.s
