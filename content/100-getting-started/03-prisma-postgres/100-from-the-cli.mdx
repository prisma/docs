 This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a project with [Prisma Postgres®](/prisma-postgres) database from the CLI using the `prisma init --db` command.

## Prerequisites


This guide assumes you have run the `prisma init --db` command to initialize Prisma with a [Prisma Postgres®](/prisma-postgres) database:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db
```

Running the command will prompt you to:

- Choose an authentication provider to log in or create a Prisma Data Platform account.
- Select a database region for your Prisma Postgres instance.
- Enter a name for your workspace project.

:::warning

Ensure your default workspace in the Prisma Data Platform has available [project](/platform/about#project) slots. If you've reached the limit, delete unused projects or set an active workspace with available slots as the default to enable the CLI to function properly.

:::

After the command runs successfully, the following actions take place:

- You'll be logged into Prisma Data Platform.
- A new Prisma project is created.
- A connection to Prisma Postgres is established and provisioned.
- The `prisma/` folder is created with a `schema.prisma` file.
- A `.env` file is generated with a `DATABASE_URL` pointing to Prisma Postgres.

The CLI output should look like:

```terminal
Let's set up your Prisma Postgres® database!
? Select your region: ap-northeast-1 - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
? Enter a project name: starter
Creating project starter...
Success! Project starter created

✔ Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

Database URL:
prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key={API_KEY}

Project link:
{PROJECT_URL}
```

## 1. Organize your project directory

If you ran the `prisma init --db` command inside a folder where you want your project to live, you can skip this step and [proceed to the next section](/getting-started/prisma-postgres/from-the-cli#2-set-up-your-project).

If you ran the command outside your intended project directory (e.g., in your home folder or another location), you need to move the generated `prisma` folder and the `.env` file into a dedicated project folder.

Create a folder  where you want the project to live and move the generated `prisma` folder and the `.env` file into that folder.

Create a new folder (e.g. `hello-prisma`) where you want your project to live and move the necessary files into it:

```terminal
mkdir hello-prisma
mv .env ./hello-prisma/
mv prisma ./hello-prisma/
```

Navigate into your project folder:

```terminal
cd ./hello-prisma
```

Now that your project is in the correct location, continue with the setup.

## 2. Set up your project

Initialize a TypeScript project and add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency:

```terminal
npm init -y
npm install prisma typescript tsx @types/node --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` file with an initial setup for your TypeScript app.

Install the required dependency to use Prisma Postgres:

```terminal
npm i @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

Initialize TypeScript:

```terminal
npx tsc --init
```

This generates a `tsconfig.json` file.

Create an `index.ts` file in the root directory:

```terminal
touch index.ts
```

Update your `package.json` to include a script for running the application:

```json
"scripts": {
  // add-start
  "start": "tsx index.ts"
  // add-end
}
```

## 3. Define models and migrate the database

Update your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to include a simple `User` model:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String @unique
}
```

After adding the model, migrate your database using [Prisma Migrate](/orm/prisma-migrate):

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## 4. Seed the database

Create a `seed.ts` file inside the `prisma` folder to populate the database with initial data:

```ts
// add-start
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

async function main() {
  await prisma.user.createMany({
    data: [
      { name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" },
      { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" }
    ],
  });
  console.log("Seeded database with initial users");
}

main()
  .catch((e) => console.error(e))
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
// add-end
```

Add a seed script to your `package.json` file:

```json
// add-start
"prisma": {
  "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
}
// add-end
```

Run the seeder script:

```terminal
npx prisma db seed
```

## 5. Create a simple TypeScript application

In your `index.ts` file, add the following code to query your database:

```ts
// add-start
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

async function main() {
  // Fetch all users
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  console.log("All users:", users);

  // Count users
  const userCount = await prisma.user.count();
  console.log("Total users count:", userCount);
}

main()
  .catch((e) => console.error(e))
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
// add-end
```

## 6. Run the application

Execute the script using:

```terminal
npm start
```

If you previously ran the seed script, you should see output similar to:

```terminal
All users: [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' }
]
Total users count: 2
```

This confirms that the Prisma client is successfully interacting with the database.

## 7. Interact with the data using Prisma Studio

Use [Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio) to interact with and view your data in a GUI:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

This starts a GUI available at [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555).

You can also use database editors like [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) and [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to interact with your database. For more details, visit [this page](/prisma-postgres).

## Next steps

You now have a simple TypeScript application using Prisma and a Prisma Postgres database. Here are some possible next steps:

- Add [caching](/prisma-postgres/caching) to your application.
- Receive [real-time events](/prisma-postgres/real-time-events) in your application.
- Learn more about [Prisma Postgres®](/prisma-postgres).
