This page provides a step-by-step guide for Prisma Postgres after setting it up with `prisma init --db`:

1. Set up a TypeScript app with Prisma ORM
1. Migrate the schema of your database
1. Query your database from TypeScript

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you set up [Prisma Postgres](/postgres) instance with `prisma init --db`:

<CodeWithResult outputResultText="" expanded={false}>

<cmd>

```terminal
npx prisma@latest init --db
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy wrap
Success! Your Prisma Postgres database is ready âœ…

We created an initial schema.prisma file and a .env file with your DATABASE_URL environment variable already set.

--- Next steps ---

Go to https://pris.ly/ppg-init for detailed instructions.

1. Define your database schema
Open the schema.prisma file and define your first models. Check the docs if you need inspiration: https://pris.ly/ppg-init 

2. Apply migrations
Run the following command to create and apply a migration:
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

3. Manage your data
View and edit your data locally by running this command: 
npx prisma studio

... or online in Console:
https://console.prisma.io/cliwxim5p005xqh0g3mvqpyak/cm6kw97t801ijzhvfwz4a0my3/cm6kw97ta01ikzhvf965vresv/studio

4. Send queries from your app
To access your database from a JavaScript/TypeScript app, you need to use Prisma ORM. Go here for step-by-step instructions: https://pris.ly/ppg-init
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

Once this command terminated:

- You're logged into Prisma Data Platform.
- A new Prisma Postgres instance was created.
- The `prisma/` folder was created with an empty `schema.prisma` file.
- The `DATABASE_URL` env var was set in a  `.env` file.

## 1. Organize your project directory

:::note

If you ran the `prisma init --db` command inside a folder where you want your project to live, you can skip this step and [proceed to the next section](/getting-started/prisma-postgres/from-the-cli#2-set-up-your-project).

:::

If you ran the command outside your intended project directory (e.g., in your home folder or another location), you need to move the generated `prisma` folder and the `.env` file into a dedicated project directory.

Create a new folder (e.g. `hello-prisma`) where you want your project to live and move the necessary files into it:

```terminal
mkdir hello-prisma
mv .env ./hello-prisma/
mv prisma ./hello-prisma/
```

Navigate into your project folder:

```terminal
cd ./hello-prisma
```

Now that your project is in the correct location, continue with the setup.

## 2. Set up your project

### 2.1. Set up TypeScript

Initialize a TypeScript project and add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency:

```terminal
npm init -y
npm install typescript tsx @types/node --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` file with an initial setup for your TypeScript app.

Next, initialize TypeScript with a `tsconfig.json` file in the project:

```terminal
npx tsc --init
```

### 2.2. Set up Prisma ORM

Install the required dependencies to use Prisma Postgres:

```terminal
npm install prisma --save-dev
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

### 2.3. Create a TypeScript script

Create an `index.ts` file in the root directory, this will be used to query your application with Prisma ORM: 

```terminal
touch index.ts
```

## 3. Migrate the database schema

Update your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to include a simple `User` model:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}
```

After adding the models, migrate your database using [Prisma Migrate](/orm/prisma-migrate):

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## 4. Send queries with Prisma ORM

Paste the following boilerplate into `index.ts`:

```ts file=index.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

async function main() {
  // ... you will write your Prisma ORM queries here
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

This code contains a `main` function that's invoked at the end of the script. It also instantiates `PrismaClient` which you'll use to send queries to your database.

### 4.1. Create a new `User` record

Let's start with a small query to create a new `User` record in the database and log the resulting object to the console. Add the following code to your `index.ts` file:

```ts file=index.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

async function main() {
  // add-start
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Alice',
      email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    },
  })
  console.log(user)
  // add-end
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Next, execute the script with the following command:

<CodeWithResult expanded={true}>

<cmd>

```terminal
npx tsx index.ts
```
</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy
{ id: 1, email: 'alice@prisma.io', name: 'Alice' }
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

Great job, you just created your first database record with Prisma Postgres! ðŸŽ‰

### 4.2. Retrieve all `User` records

Prisma ORM offers various queries to read data from your database. In this section, you'll use the `findMany` query that returns _all_ the records in the database for a given model.

Delete the previous Prisma ORM query and add the new `findMany` query instead:

```ts file=index.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

async function main() {
  // add-start
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
  console.log(users)
  // add-end
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Execute the script again:

<CodeWithResult expanded={true}>

<cmd>

```terminal
npx tsx index.ts
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy
[{ id: 1, email: 'alice@prisma.io', name: 'Alice' }]
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

Notice how the single `User` object is now enclosed with square brackets in the console. That's because the `findMany` returned an array with a single object inside.

### 4.3. Explore relation queries

One of the main features of Prisma ORM is the ease of working with [relations](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations). In this section, you'll learn how to create a `User` and a `Post` record in a nested write query. Afterwards, you'll see how you can retrieve the relation from the database using the `include` option.

First, adjust your script to include the nested query:

```ts file=index.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

async function main() {
  // add-start
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Bob',
      email: 'bob@prisma.io',
      posts: {
        create: [
          {
            title: 'Hello World',
            published: true
          },
          {
            title: 'My second post',
            content: 'This is still a draft'
          }
        ],
      },
    },
  })
  console.log(user)
  // add-end
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Run the query by executing the script again:

<CodeWithResult expanded={true}>

<cmd>

```terminal
npx tsx index.ts
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy
{ id: 2, email: 'bob@prisma.io', name: 'Bob' }
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

In order to also retrieve the `Post` records that belong to a `User`, you can use the `include` option via the `posts` relation field:

```ts file=index.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

async function main() {
// add-start
  const usersWithPosts = await prisma.user.findMany({
    include: {
      posts: true,
    },
  })
  console.dir(usersWithPosts, { depth: null })
  // add-end
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Run the script again to see the results of the nested read query:

<CodeWithResult expanded={true}>

<cmd>

```terminal
npx tsx index.ts
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy
[
  { id: 1, email: 'alice@prisma.io', name: 'Alice', posts: [] },
  {
    id: 2,
    email: 'bob@prisma.io',
    name: 'Bob',
    posts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'Hello World',
        content: null,
        published: true,
        authorId: 2
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        title: 'My second post',
        content: 'This is still a draft',
        published: false,
        authorId: 2
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

This time, you're seeing two `User` objects being printed. Both of them have a `posts` field (which is empty for `"Alice"` and populated with two `Post` objects for `"Bob"`) that represents the `Post` records associated with them.


## Next steps

You just got your feet wet with a basic Prisma Postgres setup. If you want to explore more complex queries, caching and real-time functionality, check out the official [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-prismaPostgres).

### View and edit data in Prisma Studio

Prisma ORM comes with a built-in GUI to view and edit the data in your database. You can open it using the following command:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

With Prisma Postgres, you can also directly use Prisma Studio inside the [Console](https://console.prisma.io) by selecting the **Studio** tab in your project.
