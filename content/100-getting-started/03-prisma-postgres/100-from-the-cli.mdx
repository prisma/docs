When you run the `prisma init --db` command, it logs you into the Prisma Data Platform from the terminal, creates a new Prisma Postgres instance, and initializes Prisma. If you don’t have an account, you will be prompted to create one. This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a project with [Prisma Postgres®](/prisma-postgres) database from the CLI.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have run the following command:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db
```

:::warning

Ensure your default workspace in the Prisma Data Platform has available [project](/platform/about#project) slots. If you've reached the limit, delete unused projects or set an active workspace with available slots as the default to enable the CLI to function properly.

:::

After running the command, select a database region closest to you and add a name for your workspace project:

```terminal
Let's set up your Prisma Postgres® database!
? Select your region: ap-northeast-1 - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
? Enter a project name: starter
Creating project starter...
Success! Project starter created

✔ Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

Database URL:
prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key={API_KEY}

Project link:
{PROJECT_URL}
```

When the command runs, the following actions take place:

- A new Prisma project is created.
- A connection to Prisma Postgres is established and provisioned.
- The `prisma/` folder is created with a `schema.prisma` file.
- A `.env` file is generated with a `DATABASE_URL` pointing to Prisma Postgres.

## 1. Organize your project directory

If you ran the `prisma init --db` command inside a folder where you want your project to live, you can skip this step and proceed to the next section.

If you ran the command outside your intended project directory (e.g., in your home folder or another location), you need to move the generated `prisma` folder and the `.env` file into a dedicated project folder.

Create a folder  where you want the project to live and move the generated `prisma` folder and the `.env` file into that folder.

Create a new folder (e.g. `hello-prisma`) where you want your project to live and move the necessary files into it:

```terminal
mkdir hello-prisma
mv .env ./hello-prisma/
mv prisma ./hello-prisma/
```

Navigate into your project folder:

```terminal
cd ./hello-prisma
```

Now that your project is in the correct location, continue with the setup.

## 2. Set up your project

Next, initialize a TypeScript project and add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency:

```terminal
npm init -y
npm install prisma typescript tsx @types/node --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` file with an initial setup for your TypeScript app.

Install the required dependency to use Prisma Postgres:

```terminal
npm i @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

Initialize TypeScript:

```terminal
npx tsc --init
```

This generates a `tsconfig.json` file.

Create an `index.ts` file in the root directory:

```terminal
touch index.ts
```

Update your `package.json` to include a script for running the application:

```json
"scripts": {
  // add-start
  "start": "tsx index.ts"
  // add-end
}
```

## 3. Initialize Prisma with a PostgreSQL database

Run the `prisma init --db` command to initialize Prisma with a [Prisma Postgres](/prisma-postgres) database:

## 4. Define models and migrate the database

Update your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to include a simple `User` model:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String @unique
}
```

After adding the model, migrate your database using [Prisma Migrate](/orm/prisma-migrate):

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## 5. Seed the database

Create a `seed.ts` file inside the `prisma` folder to populate the database with initial data:

```ts
// add-start
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

async function main() {
  await prisma.user.createMany({
    data: [
      { name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" },
      { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" }
    ],
  });
  console.log("Seeded database with initial users");
}

main()
  .catch((e) => console.error(e))
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
// add-end
```

Add a seed script to your `package.json` file:

```json
// add-start
"prisma": {
  "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
}
// add-end
```

Run the seeder script:

```terminal
npx prisma db seed
```

## 6. Create a simple TypeScript application

In your `index.ts` file, add the following code to query your database:

```ts
// add-start
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

async function main() {
  // Fetch all users
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  console.log("All users:", users);

  // Count users
  const userCount = await prisma.user.count();
  console.log("Total users count:", userCount);
}

main()
  .catch((e) => console.error(e))
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
// add-end
```

## 7. Run the application

Execute the script using:

```terminal
npm start
```

If you previously ran the seed script, you should see output similar to:

```terminal
All users: [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' }
]
Total users count: 2
```

This confirms that the Prisma client is successfully interacting with the database.

## 8. Interact with the data using Prisma Studio

Use [Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio) to interact with and view your data in a GUI:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

This starts a GUI available at [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555).

You can also use database editors like [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) and [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to interact with your database. For more details, visit [this page](/prisma-postgres).

## Next steps

You now have a simple TypeScript application using Prisma and a Prisma Postgres database. Here are some possible next steps:

- Add [caching](/prisma-postgres/caching) to your application.
- Receive [real-time events](/prisma-postgres/real-time-events) in your application.
- Learn more about [Prisma Postgres®](/prisma-postgres).
