This guide provides step-by-step instructions for importing data from an existing PostgreSQL database into Prisma Postgres. 

You can accomplish this migration in three steps:

1. Create a new Prisma Postgres database.
1. Export your existing data via `pg_dump`.
1. Import the previously exported data into Prisma Postgres via `pg_restore`.

In the third step, you will be using a [direct connection](/postgres/database/direct-connections) to securely connect to your Prisma Postgres database during to run `pg_restore`.

## Prerequisites

- The connection URL to your existing PostgreSQL database
- A [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io) account
- Node.js 18+ installed
- PostgreSQL CLI Tools (`pg_dump`, `pg_restore`) for creating and restoring backups

## 1. Create a new Prisma Postgres database

Follow these steps to create a new Prisma Postgres database:

1. Log in to [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) and open the Console.
1. In a [workspace](/platform/about#workspace) of your choice, click the **New project** button.
1. Type a name for your project in the **Name** field, e.g. **hello-ppg**.
1. In the **Prisma Postgres** section, click the **Get started** button.
1. In the **Region** dropdown, select the region that's closest to your current location, e.g. **US East (N. Virginia)**.
1. Click the **Create project** button.

With your Prisma Postgres instance being created, you can move to the next step.

## 2. Export data from your existing database

In this step, you're going to export the data from your existing database and store it in a `.bak` file on your local machine. 

Make sure to have the connection URL for your existing database ready, it should be [structured](/orm/overview/databases/postgresql#connection-url) like this:

```no-copy
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
```

Expand below for provider-specific instructions that help you determine the right connection string:

<details>
<summary>Neon</summary>

<br />

- Make sure to select non-pooled connection string by switching off the **Connection pooling** toggle.
- The `sslmode` has to be set to `require` and appended to your Neon database url for the command to work. 
- The connection URL should look similar to this:
    ```no-copy
    postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@YOUR-NEON-HOST/DATABASE?sslmode=require
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Supabase</summary>

- Use a database connection URL that uses [Supavisor session mode](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#supavisor-session-mode).
- The connection URL should look similar to this:
    ```no-copy
    postgres://postgres.apbkobhfnmcqqzqeeqss:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
    ```

</details>

Next, run the following command to export the data of your PostgreSQL database (replace the `__DATABASE_URL__` placeholder with your actual database connection URL):

```terminal
pg_dump \
  -Fc \
  -v \
  -d __DATABASE_URL__ \
  -n public \
  -f db_dump.bak
```

Here's a quick overview of the CLI options that were used for this command:

- `-Fc`: Uses the custom format for backups, recommended for `pg_restore`
- `-v`: Runs `pg_dump` in verbose mode
- `-d`: Specifies the database connection string
- `-n`: Specifies the target PostgreSQL schema
- `-f`: Specifies the output name for the backup file

Running this command will create a backup file named `db_dump.bak` which you will use to restore the data into your Prisma Postgres database in the next step.

## 3. Import data into Prisma Postgres

In this section, you'll use a [TCP Tunnel](/postgres/database/direct-connections#tcp-tunnel) in order to connect to your Prisma Postgres instance and import data via `pg_restore`.

### 3.1. Connecting to the Prisma Postgres Database with `@prisma/ppg-tunnel`

Open a new terminal and set the environment variable for your Prisma Postgres database connection URL. 

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI..."
```

Run the tunnel:
```bash
npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5432
```

You should see output similar to:

```cmd
Prisma Postgres auth proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:52604 🚀

Your connection is authenticated using your Prisma Postgres API key.
...

==============================
hostname:  127.0.0.1
port:      52604
username:  <anything>
password:  <none>
==============================
```


:::note
Keep this tunnel process running to maintain the connection!
:::

### 3.2. Restoring the Backup with `pg_restore`

Use the backup file from **Step 2** to restore data into Prisma Postgres database with `pg_restore` by running this command:

```bash
PGSSLMODE=disable \
pg_restore \
  -h 127.0.0.1 \
  -p 5432 \
  -v \
  -d postgres \
  ./db_dump.bak \
&& echo "-complete-"
```

Once the command completes execution, you will have successfully imported the data from your existing PostgreSQL database into Prisma Postgres 🎉

To validate that the import worked, you can use [Prisma Studio](/postgres/integrations/viewing-data#viewing-and-editing-data-in-prisma-studio). Either open it in the [Platform Console](https://console.prisma.io) by clicking the **Studio** tab in the left-hand sidenav in your project or run this command to launch Prisma Studio locally:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

## 4. Update your application code to query Prisma Postgres

### Scenario A: You are already using Prisma ORM

If you already using Prisma ORM, the only things you need to do are:

- add the Prisma Accelerate extension to your project
- update the database connection URL and re-generate Prisma Client

#### 4.A.1. Add the Prisma Accelerate extension 

Th Prisma Accelerate extension is [required](/postgres/introduction/overview#using-the-client-extension-for-prisma-accelerate-required) when using Prisma Postgres. If you are not currently using Prisma Accelerate with Prisma ORM, go through the following steps to make Prisma ORM work with Prisma Postgres.

First, install the `@prisma/extension-accelerate` package in your project:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

Then, add the extension to your Prisma Client instance:

```ts
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
```

#### 4.A.2. Update the database connection URL

The database connection URL is configured via the `url` of the `datasource` block in your `schema.prisma` file. Most commonly, it is set via an environment variable called `DATABASE_URL`:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The next steps assumes that you're a `.env` file to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (if that's not the case, you can set the environment variable in your preferred way).

Open `.env` and update the value for the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to match your Prisma Postgres connection URL, looking similar to this:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=__API_KEY__"
```

As a last step, you need to re-generate Prisma Client for so that the updated environment variables takes effect and your queries go to Prisma Postgres going forward:

```
npx prisma generate --no-engine
```

Once this is done, you can run your application and it should work as before.

### Scenario B: You are not yet using Prisma ORM

If you are not yet using Prisma ORM, you'll need to go through the following steps to use Prisma Postgres from your application:

1. Install the Prisma CLI in your project
1. Introspect the database to generate a Prisma schema
1. Generate Prisma Client
1. Update the queries in your application to use Prisma ORM

You can find the detailed step-by-step instructions for this process in this guide: [Add Prisma ORM to an existing project](/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql).
