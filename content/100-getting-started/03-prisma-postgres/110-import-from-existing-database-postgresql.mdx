This guide provides step-by-step instructions for importing data from an existing PostgreSQL database into Prisma Postgres. 

You can accomplish this migration in three steps:

1. Create a new Prisma Postgres database.
1. Export your existing data via `pg_dump`.
1. Import the previously exported data into Prisma Postgres via `pg_restore`.

In the third step, you will be using a [direct connection](/postgres/database/direct-connections) to securely connect to your Prisma Postgres database to run `pg_restore`.

## Prerequisites

- The connection URL to your existing PostgreSQL database
- A [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io) account
- Node.js 18+ installed
- PostgreSQL CLI Tools (`pg_dump`, `pg_restore`) for creating and restoring backups

:::info[Make sure your PostgreSQL tools match the Prisma Postgres version]

Prisma Postgres runs PostgreSQL 17. Your `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` tools need to be version 17 to ensure compatibility. You can check your version by running `pg_dump --version` or `pg_restore --version`.

:::

## 1. Create a new Prisma Postgres database

Follow these steps to create a new Prisma Postgres database:

1. Log in to [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) and open the Console.
1. In a [workspace](/platform/about#workspace) of your choice, click the **New project** button.
1. Type a name for your project in the **Name** field, e.g. **hello-ppg**.
1. In the **Prisma Postgres** section, click the **Get started** button.
1. In the **Region** dropdown, select the region that's closest to your current location, e.g. **US East (N. Virginia)**.
1. Click the **Create project** button.

Once your database is provisioned, obtain your direct connection string:

1. Navigate to your active Prisma Postgres instance.
1. Click the **API Keys** tab in the project's sidenav.
1. Click the **Create API key** button.
1. In the popup, provide a **Name** for the API key and click **Create**.
1. Copy the connection string starting with `postgres://`, this is your direct connection string.

Save the connection string, you'll need it in step 3.

## 2. Export data from your existing database

In this step, you're going to export the data from your existing database and store it in a `.bak` file on your local machine. 

Make sure to have the connection URL for your existing database ready, it should be [structured](/orm/overview/databases/postgresql#connection-url) like this:

```no-copy
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
```

Expand below for provider-specific instructions that help you determine the right connection string:

<details>
<summary>Neon</summary>

<br />

- Make sure to select non-pooled connection string by switching off the **Connection pooling** toggle.
- The `sslmode` has to be set to `require` and appended to your Neon database url for the command to work. 
- The connection URL should look similar to this:
    ```no-copy
    postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@YOUR-NEON-HOST/DATABASE?sslmode=require
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Supabase</summary>

- Use a database connection URL that uses [Supavisor session mode](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#supavisor-session-mode).
- The connection URL should look similar to this:
    ```no-copy
    postgres://postgres.apbkobhfnmcqqzqeeqss:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
    ```

</details>

Next, run the following command to export the data of your PostgreSQL database (replace the `__DATABASE_URL__` placeholder with your actual database connection URL):

```terminal
pg_dump \
  -Fc \
  -v \
  -d __DATABASE_URL__ \
  -n public \
  -f db_dump.bak
```

Here's a quick overview of the CLI options that were used for this command:

- `-Fc`: Uses the custom format for backups, recommended for `pg_restore`
- `-v`: Runs `pg_dump` in verbose mode
- `-d`: Specifies the database connection string
- `-n`: Specifies the target PostgreSQL schema
- `-f`: Specifies the output name for the backup file

Running this command will create a backup file named `db_dump.bak` which you will use to restore the data into your Prisma Postgres database in the next step.

## 3. Import data into Prisma Postgres

In this section, you'll use your [direct connection string](/postgres/database/direct-connections) to connect to your Prisma Postgres instance and import data via `pg_restore`.

Your direct connection string from step 1 should look like this:

```no-copy
postgres://USER:PASSWORD@db.prisma.io:5432/?sslmode=require
```

Use the backup file from **Step 2** to restore data into your Prisma Postgres database with `pg_restore` by running this command (replace `__USER__`, `__PASSWORD__` with the values from your direct connection string):

```bash
pg_restore \
  -h db.prisma.io \
  -p 5432 \
  -U __USER__ \
  -d postgres \
  -v \
  ./db_dump.bak \
&& echo "-complete-"
```

When prompted, enter the `__PASSWORD__` from your direct connection string.

:::tip

You can also use the full connection string format:

```bash
pg_restore \
  -d "postgres://USER:PASSWORD@db.prisma.io:5432/postgres?sslmode=require" \
  -v \
  ./db_dump.bak \
&& echo "-complete-"
```

:::

Once the command completes execution, you will have successfully imported the data from your existing PostgreSQL database into Prisma Postgres 🎉

To validate that the import worked, you can use [Prisma Studio](/postgres/integrations/viewing-data#viewing-and-editing-data-in-prisma-studio). Either open it in the [Platform Console](https://console.prisma.io) by clicking the **Studio** tab in the left-hand sidenav in your project or run this command to launch Prisma Studio locally:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

## 4. Update your application code to query Prisma Postgres

### Scenario A: You are already using Prisma ORM

If you're already using Prisma ORM, you need to update your database connection URL to point to your new Prisma Postgres instance.

Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file to match your Prisma Postgres direct connection string from step 1:

```bash file=.env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@db.prisma.io:5432/?sslmode=require"
```

Then, re-generate Prisma Client so that the updated environment variable takes effect:

```terminal
npx prisma generate
```

Once this is done, you can run your application and it should work as before.

### Scenario B: You are not yet using Prisma ORM

If you are not yet using Prisma ORM, you'll need to go through the following steps to use Prisma Postgres from your application:

1. Install the Prisma CLI and other required dependencies in your project
1. Introspect the database to generate a Prisma schema
1. Generate Prisma Client
1. Update the queries in your application to use Prisma ORM

You can find the detailed step-by-step instructions for this process in this guide: [Add Prisma ORM to an existing project](/getting-started/prisma-orm/add-to-existing-project/prisma-postgres).
