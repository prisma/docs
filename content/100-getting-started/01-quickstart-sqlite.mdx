In this Quickstart guide, you'll learn how to get started with Prisma ORM from scratch using a plain **TypeScript** project and a local **SQLite** database file. It covers **data modeling**, **migrations** and **querying** a database.

If you want to use Prisma ORM with your own PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB or any other supported database, go here instead:

- [Start with Prisma ORM from scratch](/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql)
- [Add Prisma ORM to an existing project](/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql)

## Prerequisites

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine (see [system requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for officially supported versions).

## 1. Create TypeScript project and set up Prisma ORM

As a first step, create a project directory and navigate into it:

```terminal
mkdir hello-prisma
cd hello-prisma
```

Next, initialize a TypeScript project using npm:

```terminal
npm init -y
npm install typescript tsx @types/node --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` with an initial setup for your TypeScript app.

:::info

See [installation instructions](/orm/tools/prisma-cli#installation) to learn how to install Prisma using a different package manager.

:::

Now, initialize TypeScript:

```terminal
npx tsc --init
```

Then, install the Prisma CLI as a development dependency in the project:

```terminal
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

Finally, set up Prisma ORM with the `init` command of the Prisma CLI:

```terminal
npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite --output ../generated/prisma
```

This creates a new `prisma` directory with a `schema.prisma` file and configures SQLite as your database. You're now ready to model your data and create your database with some tables.

## 2. Model your data in the Prisma schema

The Prisma schema provides an intuitive way to model data. Add the following models to your `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma showLineNumbers
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}
```

Models in the Prisma schema have two main purposes:

- Represent the tables in the underlying database
- Serve as foundation for the generated Prisma Client API

## 3. Configure environment variables

First, install the required dependency:

```bash
npm install dotenv --save-dev
```

Create a `.env` file in your project root (if it doesn't exist) and add your database connection string:

```env
DATABASE_URL="your_database_url_here"
```

Update your `prisma.config.ts` file in your project root:

```ts
import "dotenv/config";
import { defineConfig, env } from "prisma/config";

export default defineConfig({
    datasource: {
        url: env("DATABASE_URL"),
    },
});
```

## 4. Run a migration to create your database tables with Prisma Migrate

At this point, you have a Prisma schema but no database yet. Run the following command in your terminal to create the SQLite database and the `User` and `Post` tables represented by your models:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This command did three things:

1. It created a new SQL migration file for this migration in the `prisma/migrations` directory.
2. It executed the SQL migration file against the database.
3. It ran `prisma generate` under the hood (which installed the `@prisma/client` package and generated a tailored Prisma Client API based on your models).

Because the SQLite database file didn't exist before, the command also created it inside the `prisma` directory with the name `dev.db` as defined via the environment variable in the `.env` file.

Congratulations, you now have your database and tables ready. Let's go and learn how you can send some queries to read and write data!

## 4. Explore how to send queries to your database with Prisma Client

To get started with Prisma Client, you need to install the `@prisma/client` package:

```terminal copy
npm install @prisma/client
```

The install command invokes `prisma generate` for you which reads your Prisma schema and generates a version of Prisma Client that is _tailored_ to your models.

To send queries to the database, you will need a TypeScript file to execute your Prisma Client queries. Create a new file called `script.ts` for this purpose:

```terminal
touch script.ts
```

Then, paste the following boilerplate into it:

```ts file=script.ts showLineNumbers
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  // ... you will write your Prisma Client queries here
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

This code contains a `main` function that's invoked at the end of the script. It also instantiates `PrismaClient` which represents the query interface to your database.

### 4.1. Create a new `User` record

Let's start with a small query to create a new `User` record in the database and log the resulting object to the console. Add the following code to your `script.ts` file:

```ts file=script.ts highlight=6-12;add showLineNumbers
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  // add-start
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Alice',
      email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    },
  })
  console.log(user)
  // add-end
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Instead of copying the code, you can type it out in your editor to experience the autocompletion Prisma Client provides. You can also actively invoke the autocompletion by pressing the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SPACE</kbd> keys on your keyboard.

Next, execute the script with the following command:

<CodeWithResult expanded={true}>

<cmd>

```terminal
npx tsx script.ts
```
</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy
{ id: 1, email: 'alice@prisma.io', name: 'Alice' }
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

Great job, you just created your first database record with Prisma Client! 🎉

In the next section, you'll learn how to read data from the database.

### 4.2. Retrieve all `User` records

Prisma Client offers various queries to read data from your database. In this section, you'll use the `findMany` query that returns _all_ the records in the database for a given model.

Delete the previous Prisma Client query and add the new `findMany` query instead:

```ts file=script.ts highlight=6-7;add showLineNumbers
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  // add-start
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
  console.log(users)
  // add-end
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Execute the script again:

<CodeWithResult expanded={true}>

<cmd>

```terminal
npx tsx script.ts
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy
[{ id: 1, email: 'alice@prisma.io', name: 'Alice' }]
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

Notice how the single `User` object is now enclosed with square brackets in the console. That's because the `findMany` returned an array with a single object inside.

### 4.3. Explore relation queries with Prisma Client

One of the main features of Prisma Client is the ease of working with [relations](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations). In this section, you'll learn how to create a `User` and a `Post` record in a nested write query. Afterwards, you'll see how you can retrieve the relation from the database using the `include` option.

First, adjust your script to include the nested query:

```ts file=script.ts highlight=6-24;add showLineNumbers
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  // add-start
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Bob',
      email: 'bob@prisma.io',
      posts: {
        create: [
          {
            title: 'Hello World',
            published: true
          },
          {
            title: 'My second post',
            content: 'This is still a draft'
          }
        ],
      },
    },
  })
  console.log(user)
  // add-end
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Run the query by executing the script again:

<CodeWithResult expanded={true}>

<cmd>

```terminal
npx tsx script.ts
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy
{ id: 2, email: 'bob@prisma.io', name: 'Bob' }
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

By default, Prisma Client only returns _scalar_ fields in the result objects of a query. That's why, even though you also created a new `Post` record for the new `User` record, the console only printed an object with three scalar fields: `id`, `email` and `name`.

In order to also retrieve the `Post` records that belong to a `User`, you can use the `include` option via the `posts` relation field:

```ts file=script.ts highlight=6-11;add showLineNumbers
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
// add-start
  const usersWithPosts = await prisma.user.findMany({
    include: {
      posts: true,
    },
  })
  console.dir(usersWithPosts, { depth: null })
  // add-end
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Run the script again to see the results of the nested read query:

<CodeWithResult expanded={true}>

<cmd>

```terminal
npx tsx script.ts
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy
[
  { id: 1, email: 'alice@prisma.io', name: 'Alice', posts: [] },
  {
    id: 2,
    email: 'bob@prisma.io',
    name: 'Bob',
    posts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'Hello World',
        content: null,
        published: true,
        authorId: 2
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        title: 'My second post',
        content: 'This is still a draft',
        published: false,
        authorId: 2
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

This time, you're seeing two `User` objects being printed. Both of them have a `posts` field (which is empty for `"Alice"` and populated with two `Post` objects for `"Bob"`) that represents the `Post` records associated with them.

Notice that the objects in the `usersWithPosts` array are fully typed as well. This means you will get autocompletion and the TypeScript compiler will prevent you from accidentally typing them.

## 5. Next steps

In this Quickstart guide, you have learned how to get started with Prisma ORM in a plain TypeScript project. Feel free to explore the Prisma Client API a bit more on your own, e.g. by including filtering, sorting, and pagination options in the `findMany` query or exploring more operations like `update` and `delete` queries.
