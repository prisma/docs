In this Quickstart guide, you'll learn how to get started from scratch with Prisma ORM and a **Prisma Postgres** database in a plain **TypeScript** project. It covers the following workflows:

- Creating a [Prisma Postgres](https://prisma.io/postgres?utm_source=docs) database
- Schema migrations and queries (via [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm))
- Connection pooling and caching (via [Prisma Accelerate](https://prisma.io/accelerate))
- Real-time database change events (via [Prisma Pulse](https://prisma.io/pulse))

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you need:
- a [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) (PDP) account
- Node.js v16.13.0 or higher (learn more about [system requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements))

## 1. Set up a Prisma Postgres database in the Platform Console

Follow these steps to create your Prisma Postgres database:

1. Log in to [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/).
1. In a [workspace](/platform/about#workspace) of your choice, click the **New project** button.
1. Type a name for your project in the **Name** field, e.g. **hello-ppg**.
1. In the **Prisma Postgres** section, click the **Get started** button.
1. In the **Region** dropdown, select the region that's closest to your current location, e.g. **US East (N. Virginia)**.
1. Click the **Create project** button.

At this point, you'll be redirected to the **Database** page where you will need to wait for a few seconds while the status of your database changes from **`PROVISIONING`**, to **`ACTIVATING`** to **`CONNECTED`**.

Once the green **`CONNECTED`** label appears, your database is ready to use!

## 2. Download example and install dependencies

Copy the `try-prisma` command that's shown in the Console, paste it into your terminal and execute it.

For reference, this is what the command looks like:

```terminal
npx try-prisma@latest \
  --template databases/prisma-postgres \
  --name hello-prisma \
  --install npm
```

Once the `try-prisma` command has terminated, navigate into the project directory:

```terminal
cd hello-prisma
```

## 3. Set database connection and Pulse API key

The connection to your database and the Pulse API key are configured via environment variables in a `.env` file.

First, rename the existing `.env.example` file to just `.env`:

```terminal
mv .env.example .env
```

Next, navigate back into the Console and click the **Generate database credentials** button.

Then, copy the resulting `DATABASE_URL` and `PULSE_API_KEY` environment variables and paste it into the `.env` file.

For reference, the file should now look similar to this:

```bash no-copy
DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey...."
PULSE_API_KEY="ey...."
```

## 4. Create database tables (with a schema migration)

Next, you need to create the tables in your database. You can do this by creating and executing a schema migration with the following command of the Prisma CLI:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will map the `User` and `Post` models that are defined in your [Prisma schema](/orm/prisma-schema/) to your database. You can also review the SQL migration that was executed and created the tables in the newly created `prisma/migrations` directory.

## 5. Execute queries with Prisma ORM

The [`src/queries.ts`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/databases/prisma-postgres/src/queries.ts) script contains a number of CRUD queries that will write and read data in your database. You can execute it by running the following command in your terminal:

```terminal
npm run queries
```

Once the script has completed, you can inspect the logs in your terminal or use Prisma Studio to explore what records have been created in the database:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

## 6. Explore caching with Prisma Accelerate

The [`src/caching.ts`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/databases/prisma-postgres/src/caching.ts) script contains a sample query that uses [Stale-While-Revalidate](/accelerate/caching#stale-while-revalidate-swr) (SWR) and [Time-To-Live](/accelerate/caching#time-to-live-ttl) (TTL) to cache a database query using Prisma Accelerate. You can execute it as follows:

```terminal
npm run caching
```

Take note of the time that it took to execute the query, e.g.:

```
The query took 2009.2467149999998ms.
```

Now, run the script again:

```terminal
npm run caching
```

You'll notice that the time the query took will be a lot shorter this time, e.g.:

```
The query took 300.5655280000001ms.
```

## 7. Observe real-time events in your database

The  [`src/realtime.ts`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/databases/prisma-postgres/src/realtime.ts) script contains a demo for receiving real-time change [events](/pulse/database-events) from your database. You can start the script as follows:

```terminal
npm run realtime
```

The script now created a [stream](/pulse/api-reference#stream) that will receive database events and print them to the console whenever a write-operation (i.e. _create_, _update_ or _delete_) happens on the `User` table.

To test the stream, you can open Prisma Studio:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

... and make a change to the `User` table, e.g. create a new record. Once you've saved the change, you should see an output in the terminal that looks similar to this:

```
Received an event: {
  action: 'create',
  created: { id: 3, email: 'burk@prisma.io', name: 'Nikolas' },
  id: '01JAFNSZHQRDTW773BCAA9G7FJ',
  modelName: 'User'
}
```

## 8. Next steps

In this Quickstart guide, you have learned how to get started with Prisma ORM in a plain TypeScript project. Feel free to explore the Prisma Client API a bit more on your own, e.g. by including filtering, sorting, and pagination options in the `findMany` query or exploring more operations like `update` and `delete` queries.

### Explore the data in Prisma Studio

Prisma ORM comes with a built-in GUI to view and edit the data in your database. You can open it using the following command:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```
