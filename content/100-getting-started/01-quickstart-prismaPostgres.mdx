In this Quickstart guide, you'll learn how to get started from scratch with Prisma ORM and a **Prisma Postgres** database in a plain **TypeScript** project. It covers the following workflows:

- Creating a [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres?utm_source=docs) database
- Schema migrations and queries (via [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm))
- Connection pooling and caching (via [Prisma Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/accelerate))
- Real-time database change events (via [Prisma Pulse](https://www.prisma.io/pulse))

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you need:
- a [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) (PDP) account
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine (see [system requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for officially supported versions)

## 1. Set up a Prisma Postgres database in the Platform Console

Follow these steps to create your Prisma Postgres database:

1. Log in to [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) and open the Console.
1. In a [workspace](/platform/about#workspace) of your choice, click the **New project** button.
1. Type a name for your project in the **Name** field, e.g. **hello-ppg**.
1. In the **Prisma Postgres** section, click the **Get started** button.
1. In the **Region** dropdown, select the region that's closest to your current location, e.g. **US East (N. Virginia)**.
1. Click the **Create project** button.

At this point, you'll be redirected to the **Database** page where you will need to wait for a few seconds while the status of your database changes from **`PROVISIONING`** to **`CONNECTED`**.

Once the green **`CONNECTED`** label appears, your database is ready to use!

## 2. Download example and install dependencies

Copy the `try-prisma` command that's shown in the Console, paste it into your terminal and execute it.

For reference, this is what the command looks like:

```terminal
npx try-prisma@latest \
  --template databases/prisma-postgres \
  --name hello-prisma \
  --install npm
```

Once the `try-prisma` command has terminated, navigate into the project directory:

```terminal
cd hello-prisma
```

## 3. Set database connection URL

The connection to your database and the Pulse API key are configured via environment variables in a `.env` file.

First, rename the existing `.env.example` file to just `.env`:

```terminal
mv .env.example .env
```

Then, in your project environment in the Platform console, find your database credentials in the **Set up database access** section, copy the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and paste them into the `.env` file.

For reference, the file should now look similar to this:

```bash no-copy
DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey...."
PULSE_API_KEY=""
```

Don't worry about the `PULSE_API_KEY` environment variable yet, you'll set it later.

## 4. Create database tables (with a schema migration)

Next, you need to create the tables in your database. You can do this by creating and executing a schema migration with the following command of the Prisma CLI:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will map the `User` and `Post` models that are defined in your [Prisma schema](/orm/prisma-schema/) to your database. You can also review the SQL migration that was executed and created the tables in the newly created `prisma/migrations` directory.

## 5. Execute queries with Prisma ORM

The [`src/queries.ts`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/databases/prisma-postgres/src/queries.ts) script contains a number of CRUD queries that will write and read data in your database. You can execute it by running the following command in your terminal:

```terminal
npm run queries
```

Once the script has completed, you can inspect the logs in your terminal or use Prisma Studio to explore what records have been created in the database:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

## 6. Explore caching with Prisma Accelerate

The [`src/caching.ts`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/databases/prisma-postgres/src/caching.ts) script contains a sample query that uses [Stale-While-Revalidate](/accelerate/caching#stale-while-revalidate-swr) (SWR) and [Time-To-Live](/accelerate/caching#time-to-live-ttl) (TTL) to cache a database query using Prisma Accelerate. You can execute it as follows:

```terminal
npm run caching
```

Take note of the time that it took to execute the query, e.g.:

```no-copy
The query took 2009.2467149999998ms.
```

Now, run the script again:

```terminal
npm run caching
```

You'll notice that the time the query took will be a lot shorter this time, e.g.:

```no-copy
The query took 300.5655280000001ms.
```

## 7. Observe real-time events in your database with Prisma Pulse

The  [`src/realtime.ts`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/databases/prisma-postgres/src/realtime.ts) script contains a demo for receiving real-time change [events](/pulse/database-events) from your database via Prisma Pulse.

Before you can run it, you need to enable the real-time capabilities of Prisma Postgres in the Console:

1. Re-open your project in the [Console](https://console.prisma.io/).
1. Select the **Pulse** tab in the sidenav.
1. Find and click the **Enable Pulse** button.
1. In the section **Add Pulse to your application**, click the **Generate API key** button.
1. Copy the `PULSE_API_KEY` environment variable and paste it into your `.env` file.

For reference, your `.env` file should now look similar to this:

```bash no-copy
DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey...."
PULSE_API_KEY="ey..."
```

You can now start the script as follows:

```terminal
npm run realtime
```

The script now created a [stream](/pulse/api-reference#stream) that will receive database events and print them to the console whenever a write-operation (i.e. _create_, _update_ or _delete_) happens on the `User` table.

To test the stream, you can open Prisma Studio:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

... and make a change to the `User` table, e.g. create a new record. Once you've saved the change, you should see an output in the terminal that looks similar to this:

```no-copy
Received an event: {
  action: 'create',
  created: { id: 3, email: 'burk@prisma.io', name: 'Nikolas' },
  id: '01JAFNSZHQRDTW773BCAA9G7FJ'
}
```

## 8. Next steps

In this Quickstart guide, you have learned how to get started with Prisma ORM in a plain TypeScript project. Feel free to explore the Prisma Client API a bit more on your own, e.g. by including filtering, sorting, and pagination options in the `findMany` query or exploring more operations like `update` and `delete` queries.

### Explore the data in Prisma Studio

Prisma ORM comes with a built-in GUI to view and edit the data in your database. You can open it using the following command:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

With Prisma Postgres, you can also directly use Prisma Studio inside the [Console](https://console.prisma.io) by selecting the **Studio** tab in your project.

- [Next.js 15 example app](https://github.com/prisma/nextjs-prisma-postgres-demo) (including authentication)

### Explore ready-to-run Prisma ORM examples

Check out the [`prisma-examples`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/) repository on GitHub to see how Prisma ORM can be used with your favorite library. The repo contains examples with Express, NestJS, GraphQL as well as fullstack examples with Next.js and Vue.js, and a lot more.

These examples use SQLite by default but you can follow the instructions in the project README to switch to Prisma Postgres in a few simple steps.s
