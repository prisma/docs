Welcome to the Prisma getting started section! ðŸ‘‹ Prisma is an [open source](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) next-generation ORM. It consists of the following parts:

- [**Prisma Client**](/concepts/components/prisma-client): Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
- [**Prisma Migrate**](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate): Migration tool to easily evolve your database schema from prototyping to production
- [**Prisma Studio**](/concepts/components/prisma-studio): GUI to view and edit data in your database

Prisma is also available on the [Prisma Data Platform](https://cloud.prisma.io), a cloud-based, collaborative environment for teams and organizations to develop type-safe applications. The platform focuses on developer productivity with GitHub integration for your code and schema, a visual data browser, an online query console, and an optional data proxy for handling database connections. For more information, refer to the Prisma Data Platform [documentation](/data-platform).

For a more detailed breakdown of what problems Prisma solves, and why it's **built to make you more productive**, see the [Why Prisma](/concepts/overview/why-prisma) section.

## Which tutorial is right for me?

To get up and running with Prisma in your local environment, follow our [Quickstart guide](./quickstart). It makes no assumptions about your knowledge level and offers the **fastest** way from install to query!

If you're looking to incorporate Prisma with an **existing project**, choose whether you want to use a SQL database or MongoDB:

>
  Existing SQL project
</ButtonLink>

<ButtonLink

  type="primary"
  href="./getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/mongodb-typescript-mongodb"
>
  Existing MongoDB project
</ButtonLink>

To learn how to **create a project** with Prisma from scratch, choose between SQL and MongoDB. Both tutorials will guide you through creating a project, connecting your database, and querying your data.
