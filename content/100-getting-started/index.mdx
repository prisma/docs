Welcome to the Prisma getting started section! 👋 Prisma is an [open source](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) next-generation ORM. It consists of the following parts:

- [**Prisma Client**](../../concepts/components/prisma-client): Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
- [**Prisma Migrate**](../../concepts/components/prisma-migrate): Migration tool to easily evolve your database schema from prototyping to production
- [**Prisma Studio**](../../concepts/components/prisma-studio): GUI to view and edit data in your database

For a more detailed breakdown of what problems Prisma solves, and why it's **built to make you more productive**, see the [Why Prisma](../concepts/overview/why-prisma) section.

## Which tutorial is right for me?

The **easiest** way to get up and running with Prisma is through our [Quickstart guide](./quickstart). It makes no assumptions about your knowledge level and offers the **fastest** way from install to query!

If you're looking to incorporate Prisma with an **existing project**, choose whether you want to use a SQL database or MongoDB:

    Existing SQL project
</ButtonLink>

<ButtonLink color="dark" type="primary" href="./getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/mongodb-typescript-mongodb">
    Existing MongoDB project
</ButtonLink>

To learn how to **create a project** with Prisma from scratch, choose between SQL and MongoDB. Both tutorials will guide you through creating a project, connecting your database, and querying your data.
