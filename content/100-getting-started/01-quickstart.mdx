<TopBlock>

The following guide will get you up and running as quickly as possible by covering the following 3 steps:

1. Download a TypeScript starter project containing Prisma and an SQLite database file.
2. Install your dependencies.
3. Query some data and view the results.

> **Note**: You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14.17.0 or higher) for this tutorial. Learn more: [system requirements](/reference/system-requirements).

</TopBlock>

## 1. Download the starter project

Open your terminal and use the following command to download the starter project.

<TabbedContent
  tabs={[<FileWithIcon defaultKey="unix" text="Unix (macOS, Linux)" icon="display"/>, <FileWithIcon defaultKey="windows" text="Windows" icon="display"/>]}
  defaultTabType="OS"
>

<tab>

```terminal copy
curl -L https://pris.ly/quickstart | tar -xz --strip=2 quickstart-main/typescript/starter
```

</tab>

<tab>

```terminal copy
curl https://pris.ly/quickstart -L -o quickstart-main.tar.gz && tar -zxvf quickstart-main.tar.gz quickstart-main/typescript/starter && move quickstart-main\typescript\starter starter && rmdir /S /Q quickstart-main && del /Q quickstart-main.tar.gz
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

## 2. Install the dependencies

From the same terminal move into the project and install the dependencies:

```terminal copy
cd starter
npm install
```

## 3. Write a query and view the results

The following query will read all the `User` records from the database and return all the users and their related posts.

One of the main features of Prisma Client is the ease of working with [relations](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations). You can retrieve the `posts` of each user by using the [`include`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/select-fields#include-relations-and-select-relation-fields) option.

Add the highlighted code to the main function in the `script.ts` file.

```ts file=script.ts highlight=7,8,9,10,11;add
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// A `main` function so that you can use async/await
async function main() {
  const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
    include: { posts: true },
  })
  // use `console.dir` to print nested objects
  console.dir(allUsers, { depth: null })
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

Now run the code with the following command to see the output:

<CodeWithResult expanded={false}>

<cmd>

```terminal copy
npm run dev
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```json5 no-lines no-copy
[
  { id: 1, email: 'sarah@prisma.io', name: 'Sarah', posts: [] },
  {
    id: 2,
    email: 'maria@prisma.io',
    name: 'Maria',
    posts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'Hello World',
        content: null,
        published: false,
        authorId: 2,
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

<Admonition type="info">

Note that `allUsers` is _statically typed_ thanks to [Prisma Client's generated types](/concepts/components/prisma-client/advanced-type-safety/operating-against-partial-structures-of-model-types). You can observe the type by hovering over the `allUsers` variable in your editor.

Congratulations, you just wrote your first query with the Prisma Client and returned some data! ðŸŽ‰

## Understanding what just happened

The downloaded project had Prisma all set up and included an SQLite database with some blog data.

The `schema.prisma` file described the `User` and `Post` models that represent tables in the SQLite database.

After downloading and installing the dependencies, you wrote a query using the Prisma Client.

This query asked for all the users and their blog posts. You then printed the results of the query to the terminal.

## What next?

If you're interested in learning more about Prisma, the [Concepts](/concepts) section has all the information needed to gain a deeper understanding of how Prisma works and how it can
**make you more productive** when working with databases.

If you are looking for guidance and workflows, the [Guides](/guides) section has a plethora of content that covers subjects such as [Database guides](/guides/database), [Testing](/guides/testing), [Deployment](/guides/deployment) and [Optimizations](/guides/performance-and-optimization).

Alternatively, if you want to include Prisma in an **existing project**, the [Add to existing project](/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-postgres) guide explains some core concepts as it guides you through integrating Prisma into your workflow.

Or perhaps you're looking at **starting a new project with Prisma**? The [Start from scratch](/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgres) section guides you through creating a project, connecting your database and querying your data from scratch.
