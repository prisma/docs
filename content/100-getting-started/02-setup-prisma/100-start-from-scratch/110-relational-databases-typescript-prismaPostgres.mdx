Learn how to create a new TypeScript project with a Prisma Postgres database from scratch. This tutorial introduces you to the [Prisma CLI](/orm/tools/prisma-cli), [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client), and [Prisma Migrate](/orm/prisma-migrate) and covers the following workflows:

- Creating a TypeScript project on your local machine from scratch
- Creating a [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres?utm_source=docs) database
- Schema migrations and queries (via [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm))
- Connection pooling and caching (via [Prisma Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/accelerate))

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you need:
- a [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) (PDP) account
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine (see [system requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for officially supported versions) (see [system requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for officially supported versions)

## Create project setup

Create a project directory and navigate into it:

```terminal copy
mkdir hello-prisma
cd hello-prisma
```

Next, initialize a TypeScript project and add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency to it:

```terminal copy
npm init -y
npm install prisma typescript tsx @types/node --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` with an initial setup for your TypeScript app.

Next, initialize TypeScript:

```terminal copy
npx tsc --init
```

You can now invoke the Prisma CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```terminal
npx prisma
```

Next, set up your Prisma ORM project by creating your [Prisma Schema](/orm/prisma-schema) file with the following command:

```terminal copy
npx prisma init --db --output ../generated/prisma
```

This command does a few things:

- Creates a new directory called `prisma` that contains a file called `schema.prisma`, which contains the Prisma Schema with your database connection variable and schema models.
- Sets the `output` to a custom location.
- Creates a [`.env`](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables) file in the root directory of the project, which is used for defining environment variables (such as your database connection and API keys).

In the next section, you'll learn how to connect your Prisma Postgres database to the project you just created on your file system.
