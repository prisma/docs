Learn how to create a new Node.js or TypeScript project from scratch by connecting Prisma ORM to your database and generating a Prisma Client for database access. The following tutorial introduces you to the [Prisma CLI](/orm/tools/prisma-cli), [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client), and [Prisma Migrate](/orm/prisma-migrate).



## Prerequisites

In order to successfully complete this guide, you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine (see [system requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for officially supported versions)
- a [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) database server running

<Admonition type="warning">

This tutorial will also assume that you can push to the `main` branch of your database. Do not do this if your `main` branch has been promoted to production.

</Admonition>

Next, initialize a Node.js project and add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency to it:

```terminal copy
npm init -y
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` with an initial setup for a Node.js app.

:::info

See [installation instructions](/orm/tools/prisma-cli#installation) to learn how to install Prisma using a different package manager.

import PrismaInitPartial from './_prisma-init-partial.mdx'
