You can now invoke the Prisma CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```terminal
npx prisma
```

Next, set up your Prisma ORM project by creating your [Prisma Schema](/orm/prisma-schema) file with the following command:

<CodeBlock language="terminal">{`npx prisma init --datasource-provider ${props.datasource.toLowerCase()} --output ../generated/prisma`}</CodeBlock>

This command does a few things:

- Creates a new directory called `prisma` that contains a file called `schema.prisma`, which contains the Prisma Schema with your database connection variable and schema models.
- Sets the `datasource` to {props.datasource} and the output to a custom location, respectively.
- Creates the [`.env` file](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables) in the root directory of the project, which is used for defining environment variables (such as your database connection)

Note that the default schema created by `prisma init` uses PostgreSQL as the `provider`. If you didn't specify a provider with the `datasource-provider` option, you need to edit the `datasource` block to use the <code>{props.datasource.toLowerCase()}</code> provider instead:

<CodeBlock language="prisma" metastring="file=prisma/schema.prisma">
{`datasource db {
  //edit-next-line
    provider = "${props.datasource.toLowerCase()}"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}`}
</CodeBlock>
