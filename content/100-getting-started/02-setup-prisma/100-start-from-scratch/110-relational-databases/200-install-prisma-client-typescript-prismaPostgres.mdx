## Install and generate Prisma Client

To get started with Prisma Client, you need to install the `@prisma/client` package:

```terminal copy
npm install @prisma/client
```

You can now import the `PrismaClient` constructor from the `@prisma/client` package to create an instance of Prisma Client to send queries to your database. You'll learn how to do that in the next section.

:::note Good to know

The [`@prisma/client` npm package](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client#the-prismaclient-npm-package) that was created in your `node_modules` is a _special_ library compared to other npm libraries.

Usually, the code of an npm package is downloaded in your project from the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) registry and is only updated when you explicitly call `npm install` again. The `@prisma/client` npm package is different!

It contains code (TypeScript types, methods, queries, ...) that is tailored to _your_ Prisma schema file in `prisma/schema.prisma`. This means, that whenever you make changes to your Prisma schema file, you also need to update the `@prisma/client` folder inside `node_modules`. 

However, instead of doing this using an `npm install` as with other npm packages, you can do this by running the `prisma generate` command, which reads your Prisma schema and generates a version of Prisma Client that is tailored to your models:

Whenever you update your Prisma schema, you will have to update your database schema using either `prisma migrate dev` or `prisma db push`. This will keep your database schema in sync with your Prisma schema. The commands will also regenerate Prisma Client.

## Install the Prisma Accelerate extension

Since Prisma Postgres provides a connection pool and (optional) caching layer with Prisma Accelerate, you need to install the Accelerate [Client extension](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions) in your project as well:

```
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

With that you're all set to read and write data in your database. Move on to the next page to start querying your Prisma Postgres database using Prisma Client.
