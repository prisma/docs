## Install and generate Prisma Client

To get started with Prisma Client, first install the `@prisma/client` package:

```terminal copy
npm install @prisma/client
```

Then, run `prisma generate` which reads your Prisma schema and generates the Prisma Client.

```terminal copy
npx prisma generate
```

You can now import the `PrismaClient` constructor from the `@prisma/client` package to create an instance of Prisma Client to send queries to your database. You'll learn how to do that in the next section.

:::note Good to know

When you run `prisma generate`, you are actually creating code (TypeScript types, methods, queries, ...) that is tailored to _your_ Prisma schema file or files in the `prisma` directory. This means, that whenever you make changes to your Prisma schema file, you also need to update the Prisma Client. You can do this by running the `prisma generate` command.

Whenever you update your Prisma schema, you will have to update your database schema using either `prisma migrate dev` or `prisma db push`. This will keep your database schema in sync with your Prisma schema. These commands will also run `prisma generate` under the hood to re-generate your Prisma Client.
