## Creating the database schema

In this guide, you'll use [Prisma Migrate](/orm/prisma-migrate) to create the tables in your database. 

To do so, first add the following Prisma data model to your Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma copy
model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}

model Profile {
  id     Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio    String?
  user   User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int     @unique
}

model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}
```

This data model defines three [models](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models) (which will be mapped to _tables_ in the underlying database):
- `Post`
- `Profile`
- `User`

It also defines two [relations](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations):
- A one-to-many relation between `User` and `Post` (i.e. "_one_ user can have _many_ posts")
- A one-to-one relation between `User` and `Profile` (i.e. "_one_ user can have _one_ profile")

To map your data model to the database schema, you need to use the `prisma migrate` CLI commands:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This command did two things:

1. It generated a new SQL migration file for this migration
1. It ran the SQL migration file against the database

You can inspect the generated SQL migration file in the newly created `prisma/migrations` directory.

:::tip Explore your database in Prisma Studio

[Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio) is a visual editor for your database. You can open it with the following command in your terminal:

```
npx prisma studio
```

Since you just created the database, you won't see any records but you can take a look at the empty `User`, `Post` and `Profile` tables.

Great, you now created three tables in your database with Prisma Migrate. In the next section, you'll learn how to install Prisma Client which lets you send queries to your database from your TypeScript app.
