## Set up a Prisma Postgres database in the PDP Console

Follow these steps to create your Prisma Postgres database:

1. Log in to [PDP Console](https://console.prisma.io/).
1. In a [workspace](/platform/about#workspace) of your choice, click the **New project** button.
1. Type a name for your project in the **Name** field, e.g. **hello-ppg**.
1. In the **Prisma Postgres** section, click the **Get started** button.
1. In the **Region** dropdown, select the region that's closest to your current location, e.g. **US East (N. Virginia)**.
1. Click the **Create project** button.

At this point, you'll be redirected to the **Dashboard** where you will need to wait for a few seconds while the status of your database changes from **`PROVISIONING`**, to **`ACTIVATING`** to **`CONNECTED`**.

Once the green **`CONNECTED`** label appears, your database is ready to use.

In the Console UI, you'll see a code snippet for a `.env` file with two environment variables defined, looking similar to this:

**TODO:** Add screenshot

## Set environment variables in your local project

Copy both environment variables from the Console UI and paste them into your `.env` file. Your `.env` file should look similar to this:

```bash file=.env no-copy
DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey..."
PULSE_API_KEY="ey..."
```

> **Note**: The `api_key` in the `DATABASE_URL` should be identical to the `PULSE_API_KEY`. Don't worry too much about the `PULSE_API_KEY` yet, we'll explain later why you need that.

By setting the  `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file, you're ensuring that Prisma ORM can connect to your database. The `DATABASE_URL` is used in the `datasource` block in your Prisma schema:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  // highlight-next-line
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

That's it! You can now start using the Prisma CLI to interact with your Prisma Postgres database. In the next section, you'll learn how to use the Prisma CLI to create and run migrations against your database to update its schema.
