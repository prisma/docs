## Write your first query with Prisma Client

Now that you have generated [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client), you can start writing queries to read and write data in your database. For the purpose of this guide, you'll use a plain TypeScript script to explore some basic features of Prisma Client.

Create a new file named `queries.ts` and add the following code to it:

```js file=queries.ts copy
// 1
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

// 2
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
  .$extends(withAccelerate())

// 3
async function main() {
  // ... you will write your Prisma Client queries here
}

// 4
main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    // 5
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet:

1. Import the `PrismaClient` constructor and the `withAccelerate` extension.
1. Instantiate `PrismaClient` and add the Accelerate extension.
1. Define an `async` function named `main` to send queries to the database.
1. Call the `main` function.
1. Close the database connections when the script terminates.

Inside the `main` function, add the following query to read all `User` records from the database and log the result:

```ts file=queries.ts
async function main() {
  //add-start
  const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany()
  console.log(allUsers)
  //add-end
}
```

Now run the code with this command:

```terminal copy
npx tsx queries.ts
```

This should print an empty array because there are no `User` records in the database yet:

```json no-lines
[]
```

## Write data into the database

The `findMany` query you used in the previous section only _reads_ data from the database (although it was still empty). 

In this section, you'll learn how to write a query to _write_ new records into the `Post`, `User` and `Profile` tables all at once.

Adjust the `main` function by removing the code from before and adding the following:

```ts file=queries.ts highlight=2-21;add copy
async function main() {
  //add-start
  await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Alice',
      email: 'alice@prisma.io',
      posts: {
        create: { title: 'Hello World' },
      },
      profile: {
        create: { bio: 'I like turtles' },
      },
    },
  })

  const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
    include: {
      posts: true,
      profile: true,
    },
  })
  console.dir(allUsers, { depth: null })
  //add-end
}
```

This code creates a new `User` record together with new `Post` and `Profile` records using a [nested write](/orm/prisma-client/queries/relation-queries#nested-writes) query. 

The records are connected via the [relation fields](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations#relation-fields) that you defined in your Prisma schema.

Notice that you're also passing the [`include`](/orm/prisma-client/queries/select-fields#include-relations-and-select-relation-fields) option to `findMany` which tells Prisma Client to include the `posts` and `profile` relations on the returned `User` objects.

Run the code with this command:

```terminal copy
npx tsx queries.ts
```

The output should look similar to this:

```js no-copy showLineNumbers
[
  {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    id: 1,
    name: 'Alice',
    posts: [
      {
        content: null,
        createdAt: 2020-03-21T16:45:01.246Z,
        updatedAt: 2020-03-21T16:45:01.246Z,
        id: 1,
        published: false,
        title: 'Hello World',
        authorId: 1,
      }
    ],
    profile: {
      bio: 'I like turtles',
      id: 1,
      userId: 1,
    }
  }
]
```

Also note that the `allUsers` variable is _statically typed_ thanks to [Prisma Client's generated types](/orm/prisma-client/type-safety/operating-against-partial-structures-of-model-types). You can observe the type by hovering over the `allUsers` variable in your editor. It should be typed as follows:

```ts no-copy showLineNumbers
const allUsers: ({
  posts: {
    id: number;
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
    title: string;
    content: string | null;
    published: boolean;
    authorId: number;
  }[];
  profile: {
    id: number;
    bio: string | null;
    userId: number;
  } | null;
} & {
  ...;
})[]
```

<details>
<summary>Expand for a visual view of the records that have been created</summary>


The query added new records to the `User`, `Post`, and `Profile` tables:

**User**

| **id** | **email**           | **name**  |
| :----- | :------------------ | :-------- |
| `1`    | `"alice@prisma.io"` | `"Alice"` |

**Post**

| **id** | **createdAt**              |       **updatedAt**        | **title**       | **content** | **published** | **authorId** |
| :----- | :------------------------- | :------------------------: | :-------------- | :---------- | :------------ | :----------- |
| `1`    | `2020-03-21T16:45:01.246Z` | `2020-03-21T16:45:01.246Z` | `"Hello World"` | `null`      | `false`       | `1`          |

**Profile**

| **id** | **bio**            | **userId** |
| :----- | :----------------- | :--------- |
| `1`    | `"I like turtles"` | `1`        |

The numbers in the `authorId` column on `Post` and `userId` column on `Profile` both reference the `id` column of the `User` table, meaning the `id` value `1` column therefore refers to the first (and only) `User` record in the database.

</details>

Before moving on to the next section, you'll "publish" the `Post` record you just created using an `update` query. Adjust the `main` function as follows:

```ts file=queries.ts copy
async function main() {
  const post = await prisma.post.update({
    where: { id: 1 },
    data: { published: true },
  })
  console.log(post)
}
```

Now run the code using the same command as before:

```terminal copy
npx tsx queries.ts
```

You will see the following output:

```js no-lines
{
  id: 1,
  title: 'Hello World',
  content: null,
  published: true,
  authorId: 1
}
```

The `Post` record with an `id` of `1` now got updated in the database:

**Post**

| **id** | **title**       | **content** | **published** | **authorId** |
| :----- | :-------------- | :---------- | :------------ | :----------- |
| `1`    | `"Hello World"` | `null`      | `true`        | `1`          |

Fantastic, you just wrote new data into your database for the first time using Prisma Client ðŸš€

## Receive real-time updates when data changes in the database

Because Prisma Postgres comes with [Prisma Pulse](/pulse) by default, you can easily stream any changes that are happening in your database into your application by simply using your existing `PrismaClient` instance. Let's see how it works!

First, install the Pulse Client extension in your project:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/extension-pulse
```

Next, create a new file called `realtime.ts` and add the following code to it:

```ts file=realtime.ts
// 1
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse';

// 2
const apiKey: string = process.env.PULSE_API_KEY ?? '';
if (!apiKey || apiKey === "") {
  console.log(`Please set the \`PULSE_API_KEY\` environment variable in the \`.env\` file.`);
  process.exit(1);
}

// 3
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({ apiKey: apiKey })
);


async function main() {

  // 4
  const stream = await prisma.user.stream();

  process.on('exit', () => {
    stream.stop();
  });

  // 5
  console.log(`Waiting for an event on the \`User\` table ... `);
  for await (const event of stream) {
    console.log('Received an event:', event);
  }
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e);
    await prisma.$disconnect();
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

There's a bunch of things happening here, let's take a closer look:

1. Import the `PrismaClient` constructor and the `withPulse` extension.
1. Read the `PULSE_API_KEY` environmen variable (which is configured in the `.env` file).
1. Instantiate `PrismaClient` and add the Pulse extension (with the Pulse API key).
1. Create a _stream_ to capture any [write-evens](/pulse/database-events) on the `User` table.
1. Start an async iterator that waits for new events and will log them to your terminal.

Start the script with the following command:

```terminal
npx tsx realtime.ts
```

You should see the following output:

```terminal no-copy
Waiting for an event on the `User` table ... 
```

In the same terminal, you'll now see new output being logged whenever:
- a new `User` record is created
- an existing `User` record is updated
- an existing `User` record is deleted

To trigger one of these events, you can use [Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio). Go ahead and open it (in a new terminal tab or window) using this command:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

If you create a new `User` record in the visual editor, you should see output similar to this in previous terminal tab/window:

```terminal no-copy
Received an event: {
  action: 'create',
  created: { id: @, email: 'bob@prisma.io', name: 'Bob' },
  id: '01JAFNSZHQRDTW773BCAA9G7FJ',
  modelName: 'User'
}
```

These change events will also be triggered when you write to the database using Prisma Client. For example, you could update your `queries.ts` file with the following `update` query to rename the user from `"Alice"` to `"Alicia"`:

```ts file=queries.ts
async function main() {
  //add-start
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: {
      id: 1
    },
    data: {
      name: 'Alicia',
      email: 'alicia@prisma.io',
    }
  });
  //add-end
}
```

Then you can run the script using the command from before (in a new terminal tab or window):

```terminal
npx tsx queries.ts
```

You should now see output similar to this in previous terminal tab/window:

```terminal no-copy
{
  action: 'update',
  after: { id: 1, email: 'alicia@prisma.io', name: 'Alicia' },
  before: null,
  id: '0/2A5A248',
  modelName: 'User'
}
```
