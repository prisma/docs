Learn how to create a new Node.js or TypeScript project from scratch by connecting Prisma ORM to your database and generating a Prisma Client for database access. The following tutorial introduces you to the [Prisma CLI](/orm/tools/prisma-cli), [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client), and [Prisma Migrate](/orm/prisma-migrate).



## Prerequisites

In order to successfully complete this guide, you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine (see [system requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for officially supported versions)
- a [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) database server running

> See [System requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for exact version requirements.

Make sure you have your database [connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls) at hand. If you don't have a database server running and just want to explore Prisma ORM, check out the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-sqlite).

## Create project setup

As a first step, create a project directory and navigate into it:

```terminal copy
mkdir hello-prisma
cd hello-prisma
```

Next, initialize a TypeScript project and add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency to it:

```terminal copy
npm init -y
npm install prisma typescript tsx @types/node --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` with an initial setup for your TypeScript app.

Next, initialize TypeScript:

```terminal copy
npx tsc --init
```

<Admonition>

See [installation instructions](/orm/tools/prisma-cli#installation) to learn how to install Prisma using a different package manager.

You can now invoke the Prisma CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```terminal
npx prisma
```

Next, set up your Prisma ORM project by creating your [Prisma Schema](/orm/prisma-schema) file with the following command:

```terminal copy
npx prisma init
```

This command does two things:

- creates a new directory called `prisma` that contains a file called `schema.prisma`, which contains the Prisma schema with your database connection variable and schema models
- creates the [`.env` file](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables) in the root directory of the project, which is used for defining environment variables (such as your database connection)
