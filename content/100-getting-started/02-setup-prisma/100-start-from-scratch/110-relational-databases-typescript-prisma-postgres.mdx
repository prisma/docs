Learn how to create a new Node.js or TypeScript project from scratch by setting up a Prisma Postgres database, connecting Prisma ORM to it and generating a Prisma Client for database access. The following tutorial introduces you to the [Prisma CLI](/orm/tools/prisma-cli), [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client), and [Prisma Migrate](/orm/prisma-migrate).

It covers the following workflows:

- Creating a [Prisma Postgres](https://prisma.io/data-platform/postgres) database
- Schema migrations and queries (via [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm))
- Connection pooling and caching (via [Prisma Accelerate](https://prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate))
- Real-time database change events (via [Prisma Pulse](https://prisma.io/data-platform/pulse))


## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you need:
- a [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) (PDP) account
- Node.js v16.13.0 or higher (learn more about [system requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements))

> See [System requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for exact version requirements.

## 1. Set up a Prisma Postgres database in the PDP Console

Follow these steps to create your Prisma Postgres database:

1. Log in to [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/).
1. In a [workspace](/platform/about#workspace) of your choice, click the **New project** button.
1. Type a name for your project in the **Name** field, e.g. **hello-ppg**.
1. In the **Prisma Postgres** section, click the **Get started** button.
1. In the **Region** dropdown, select the region that's closest to your current location, e.g. **US East (N. Virginia)**.
1. Click the **Create project** button.

At this point, you'll be redirected to the **Dashboard** where you will need to wait for a few seconds while the status of your database changes from **`PROVISIONING`**, to **`ACTIVATING`** to **`CONNECTED`**.

Once the green **`CONNECTED`** label appears, your database is ready to use!

## Create project setup

As a first step, create a project directory and navigate into it:

```terminal copy
mkdir hello-prisma
cd hello-prisma
```

Next, initialize a TypeScript project and add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency to it:

```terminal copy
npm init -y
npm install prisma typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` with an initial setup for your TypeScript app.

Next, initialize TypeScript:

```terminal copy
npx tsc --init
```

See [installation instructions](/orm/tools/prisma-cli#installation) to learn how to install Prisma using a different package manager.

</Admonition>

You can now invoke the Prisma CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```terminal
npx prisma
```

Next, set up your Prisma ORM project by creating your [Prisma Schema](/orm/prisma-schema) file with the following command:

```terminal copy
npx prisma init
```

This command does two things:

- creates a new directory called `prisma` that contains a file called `schema.prisma`, which contains the Prisma schema with your database connection variable and schema models
- creates the [`.env` file](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables/env-files) in the root directory of the project, which is used for defining environment variables (such as your database connection)
