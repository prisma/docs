Learn how to add Prisma ORM to an existing Node.js or TypeScript project by connecting it to your database and generating a Prisma Client for database access. The following tutorial introduces you to the [Prisma CLI](/orm/tools/prisma-cli), [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client), and [Prisma Introspection](/orm/prisma-schema/introspection).



:::tip

If you're migrating to Prisma ORM from another ORM, see our [Migrate from TypeORM](/guides/migrate-from-typeorm) or [Migrate from Sequelize](/guides/migrate-from-sequelize) migration guides.

:::

## Prerequisites

In order to successfully complete this guide, you need:

- an existing Node.js project with a `package.json`
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine (see [system requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for officially supported versions)
- a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server running and a database with at least one table

> See [System requirements](/orm/reference/system-requirements) for exact version requirements.

Make sure you have your database [connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls) (that includes your authentication credentials) at hand! If you don't have a database server running and just want to explore Prisma ORM, check out the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-sqlite).

## Set up Prisma ORM

As a first step, navigate into your project directory that contains the `package.json` file.

Next, add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency to your project:

```terminal copy
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

:::note

If your project contains multiple directories with `package.json` files (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, etc.), note that Prisma ORM is specifically designed for use in the API/backend layer. To set up Prisma, navigate to the appropriate backend directory containing the relevant `package.json` file and configure Prisma there.

:::

You can now invoke the Prisma CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```terminal
npx prisma
```

<Admonition>

See [installation instructions](/orm/tools/prisma-cli#installation) to learn how to install Prisma ORM using a different package manager.

</Admonition>

Next, set up your Prisma ORM project by creating your [Prisma schema](/orm/prisma-schema) file template with the following command:

```terminal copy
npx prisma init
```

This command does two things:

- creates a new directory called `prisma` that contains a file called `schema.prisma`, which contains the Prisma schema with your database connection variable and schema models
- creates the [`.env` file](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables) in the root directory of the project, which is used for defining environment variables (such as your database connection)
