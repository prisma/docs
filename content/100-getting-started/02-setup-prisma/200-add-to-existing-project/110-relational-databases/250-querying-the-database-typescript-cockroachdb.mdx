## Write your first query with Prisma Client

Now that you have generated Prisma Client, you can start writing queries to read and write data in your database.

If you're building a REST API, you can use Prisma Client in your route handlers to read and write data in the database based on incoming HTTP requests. If you're building a GraphQL API, you can use Prisma Client in your resolvers to read and write data in the database based on incoming queries and mutations.

For the purpose of this guide however, you'll just create a plain Node.js script to learn how to send queries to your database using Prisma Client. Once you have an understanding of how the API works, you can start integrating it into your actual application code (e.g. REST route handlers or GraphQL resolvers).

Create a new file named `index.ts` and add the following code to it:

```ts file=index.ts showLineNumbers
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  // ... you will write your Prisma Client queries here
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet:

1. Import the `PrismaClient` constructor from the `@prisma/client` node module
1. Instantiate `PrismaClient`
1. Define an `async` function named `main` to send queries to the database
1. Call the `main` function
1. Close the database connections when the script terminates

Depending on what your models look like, the Prisma Client API will look different as well. For example, if you have a `User` model, your `PrismaClient` instance exposes a property called `user` on which you can call [CRUD](/orm/prisma-client/queries/crud) methods like `findMany`, `create` or `update`. The property is named after the model, but the first letter is lowercased (so for the `Post` model it's called `post`, for `Profile` it's called `profile`).

The following examples are all based on the models in the Prisma schema.

Inside the `main` function, add the following query to read all `User` records from the database and print the result:

```ts file=index.ts showLineNumbers
async function main() {
  const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany()
  console.log(allUsers)
}
```

Now run the code with your current TypeScript setup. If you're using `tsx`, you can run it like this:

```terminal copy
npx tsx index.ts
```

If you created a database using the schema from the database introspection step, the query should print an empty array because there are no `User` records in the database yet.

```no-copy
[]
```

If you introspected an existing database with records, the query should return an array of JavaScript objects.

## Write data into the database

The `findMany` query you used in the previous section only _reads_ data from the database. In this section, you'll learn how to write a query to _write_ new records into the `Post` and `User` tables.

Adjust the `main` function to send a `create` query to the database:

```ts file=index.ts showLineNumbers
async function main() {
  await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Alice',
      email: 'alice@prisma.io',
      posts: {
        create: { title: 'Hello World' },
      },
      profile: {
        create: { bio: 'I like turtles' },
      },
    },
  })

  const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
    include: {
      posts: true,
      profile: true,
    },
  })
  console.dir(allUsers, { depth: null })
}
```

This code creates a new `User` record together with new `Post` and `Profile` records using a [nested write](/orm/prisma-client/queries/relation-queries#nested-writes) query. The `User` record is connected to the two other ones via the `Post.author` ↔ `User.posts` and `Profile.user` ↔ `User.profile` [relation fields](/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations#relation-fields) respectively.

Notice that you're passing the [`include`](/orm/prisma-client/queries/select-fields#return-nested-objects-by-selecting-relation-fields) option to `findMany` which tells Prisma Client to include the `posts` and `profile` relations on the returned `User` objects.

Run the code with your current TypeScript setup. If you're using `tsx`, you can run it like this:

```terminal copy
npx tsx index.ts
```

Before moving on to the next section, you'll "publish" the `Post` record you just created using an `update` query. Adjust the `main` function as follows:

```ts file=index.ts showLineNumbers
async function main() {
  const post = await prisma.post.update({
    where: { title: 'Hello World' },
    data: { published: true },
  })
  console.log(post)
}
```

Run the code with your current TypeScript setup. If you're using `tsx`, you can run it like this:

```terminal copy
npx tsx index.ts
```
