Learn how to add Prisma to an existing Node.js or TypeScript project by connecting it to your database and generating a Prisma Client for database access. The following tutorial introduces you to the [Prisma CLI](/concepts/components/prisma-cli), [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client), and [Prisma Introspection](/concepts/components/introspection).

## Prerequisites

In order to successfully complete this guide, you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
- Access to a MongoDB 4.2+ server with a replica set deployment. We recommend using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

  <Admonition type="warning">

  The MongoDB database connector uses transactions to support nested writes. Transactions **requires** a [replica set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/) deployment. The easiest way to deploy a replica set is with [Atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/). It's free to get started.

  </Admonition>

Make sure you have your database [connection URL](/reference/database-reference/connection-urls) (that includes your authentication credentials) at hand! If you don't have a database server running and just want to explore Prisma, check out the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart).

> See [System requirements](/reference/system-requirements) for exact version requirements.

## Set up Prisma

As a first step, navigate into it your project directory that contains the `package.json` file.

Next, add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency to your project:

```terminal copy
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

You can now invoke the Prisma CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```terminal copy
npx prisma
```

Next, set up your Prisma project by creating your [Prisma schema](/concepts/components/prisma-schema) file template with the following command:

```terminal copy
npx prisma init
```

This command does two things:

- creates a new directory called `prisma` that contains a file called `schema.prisma`, which contains the Prisma schema with your database connection variable and schema models
- creates the [`.env` file](/guides/development-environment/environment-variables#using-env-files) in the root directory of the project, which is used for defining environment variables (such as your database connection)
