## Connecting your database

To connect your database, you need to set the `url` field of the `datasource` block in your Prisma schema to your database [connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls):

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma showLineNumbers
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

In this case, the `url` is [set via an environment variable](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables) which is defined in `.env`:

```bash file=.env showLineNumbers
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://test:test@cluster0.ns1yp.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase"
```

You now need to adjust the connection URL to point to your own database.

The [format of the connection URL](/orm/reference/connection-urls) for your database depends on the database you use. For MongoDB, it looks as follows (the parts spelled all-uppercased are _placeholders_ for your specific connection details):

```no-lines
mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
```

Here's a short explanation of each component:

- `USERNAME`: The name of your database user
- `PASSWORD`: The password for your database user
- `HOST`: The host where a [`mongod`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod) (or [`mongos`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos)) instance is running
- `PORT`: The port where your database server is running (typically `27017` for MongoDB)
- `DATABASE`: The name of the database

> If you see the following error: `Error in connector: SCRAM failure: Authentication failed.`, you can specify the source database for the authentication by [adding](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/9994#discussioncomment-1562283) `?authSource=admin` to the end of the connection string.
