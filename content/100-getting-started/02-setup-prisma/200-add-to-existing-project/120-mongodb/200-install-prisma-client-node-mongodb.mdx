## Install and generate Prisma Client

To get started with Prisma Client, you need to install the `@prisma/client` package:

```terminal copy
npm install @prisma/client
```

The install command invokes `prisma generate` for you which reads your Prisma schema and generates a version of Prisma Client that is _tailored_ to your models.

Whenever you make changes to your Prisma schema in the future, you manually need to invoke `prisma generate` in order to accommodate the changes in your Prisma Client API.
