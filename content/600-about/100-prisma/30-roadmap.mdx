Our roadmap helps us share our current priorities: what we are currently working on and what we are planning to work on in the near term. This reflects our _current plans_ today, and the content is subject to change at any time. Actual results and plans may differ as a result of changing our product strategy or reacting to demands from our user base.

You can [check out the full roadmap here](https://pris.ly/roadmap).
