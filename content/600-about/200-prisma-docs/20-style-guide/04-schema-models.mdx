`User` and `Post` are the canonical models that we use in our examples throughout the Prisma docs. This page gives some context on why we selected them, and how to interpret them.

## The `User` and `Post` data model

We chose the `User` and `Post` models for the following reasons:

- They do not require domain-specific knowledge.
- They are commonly used as an example in the ORM space. This makes them familiar for users coming from other tools.
- Consistent models make it easier for the reader when learning about different concepts, because there will be less context switching.
- Less decision making and cognitive overhead for the docs authors. Using the same models reduces decision fatigue and is one less thing to worry about when trying to explain concepts.

We plan to [add more schema examples](https://github.com/prisma/docs/issues/1626) to the docs. They will provide you with starting points for common data models, such as e-commerce.

## Naming conventions for tables and columns

- Format table names in [PascalCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
- Format column names in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
