`User` and `Post` are the canonical models that we use in our examples throughout the Prisma docs.

## The `User` and `Post` data model

We chose the `User` and `Post` models for the following reasons:

- They do not require domain-specific knowledge.
- They are commonly used as an example in the ORM space. This makes them familiar for users coming from other tools.
- Consistent models make it easier for the reader when learning about different concepts, because there will be less context switching.
- Less decision making and cognitive overhead for the docs authors. Using the same models reduces decision fatigue and is one less thing to worry about when trying to explain concepts.

## Naming conventions

See the [naming conventions](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#naming-conventions) for Prisma schemas.

Use the following for table and column names:

- Format table names in [PascalCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
- Format column names in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
