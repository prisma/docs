## Screenshots

- Use SnagIt to edit screenshots.
- Always apply a centered minimum shadow to the image. This helps the screenshot stand out on the page.

### File type and path

- Save the screenshot as a PNG file.
- Filename guidelines:
  - Keep the filename short, but descriptive.
  - Use only alphanumeric characters.
  - Use hyphens (-) instead of space characters.
  - Example: `editor-screen.png`.
- Put the PNG in the same directory as the associated Markdown file.
- Always save the SnagIt Project file (filename extension is `.sngx`).
- Save the source file to the same directory as the PNG file. Use the same filename prefix as for the PNG file. Example: `editor-screen.sngx`.

## Diagrams

- Use [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to create diagrams.
- For consistency, when you create a new diagram, base it on an existing one.
- Add the URL of the source image to the Markdown page. Use a comment immediately above the image tag, as follows:

```md
<!-- https://www.figma.com/file/H7EMWAuCaRVHrdNoQpky7J/Tracing?node-id=2%3A37 -->

```
