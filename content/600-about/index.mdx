This section of our docs is about... the docs!

Here we describe how our docs are made and how we would prefer you contribute. Here are some handy links:

- [Our style guide](/about/style-guide) is a good place to start to learn about how we write our documentation and the tone we use.
- [Our component guide](/about/docs-components) is great for understanding the React components that are available to you in our documentation.
- [Our template](/about/template) is a starter template for a page of content.

## The `User` and `Post` data model

`User` and `Post` are the canonical models that are being used throughout the Prisma docs. The `User` and `Post` models have been selected for the following reasons:

- These two models do not require domain-specific knowledge.
- They are also commonly used as an example in the ORM space, making them familiar for users coming from other tools.
- Having consistent models makes it easier for the reader when learning about different concepts, since there will be less context switching.
- Less decision making and cognitive overhead for the docs authors. Using the same models reduces decision fatigue and is one less thing to worry about when trying to explain concepts.

## Naming conventions for tables and columns

Prisma ORM defaults to models (and therefore tables) formatted in [PascalCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) while fields (and therefore columns) are in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)

## Embrace redundancy

Meet the user where they are. If a piece of information needs to be described in multiple places, do so, but be sure to use [a markdown fragment](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#importing-markdown) so that information can be updated in one place in the future.
