## Concurrency limits of the Prisma Data Proxy

The concurrency limits of the Prisma Data Proxy generally define the maximum number of database connections that can run simultaneously for a single project. By default, at least one proxy instance is started for a single project environment and additional instances are started when increase in traffic demands that.

In addition, more proxy instances start for a project under these circumstances:

- you create and start using a new environment
- the number of running proxy instances cannot handle the number of incoming queries
- multiple Prisma Clients connect that use a different version of the Prisma Client
- multiple Prisma Clients connect that use a different version of the Prisma schema

| Concurrency limits                                                                                         | Number                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Connection pool per proxy instance                                                                         | **Default**: 60<br />**Max**: 120 |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Early Adopter** plan                                     | 3                                 |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Free** plan                                              | 16                                |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Scale** plan                                             | 16                                |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Enterprise** plan                                        | Custom                            |
| Approximate maximum queries per second with 16 proxy instances\*<br /><br />(**Free** and **Scale** plans) | ~19,200                           |

**Note**<br /><br /> \* The number in the last row does not take into account the complexity of the queries.<br /><br />Complex queries which might require multiple database operations might not reach the maximum numbers and might slow down other queries waiting for a database connection.

## Compatibility with Prisma ORM

We are dedicated to keeping the Prisma Data Platform compatible with the latest version of the Prisma ORM.

- **Compatibility of the platform Data Browser, Query Console, Schema with the Prisma ORM**
  - The interfaces are updated after each Prisma ORM release and aim to support the latest version.
  - In rare occasions, there might be several days worth of a delay before the interfaces begin to support the latest version of the Prisma ORM.
- **Compatibility of the Prisma Data Proxy with the Prisma ORM**
  - Prisma Data Proxy is updated almost immediately to the latest version of the Prisma ORM.
  - Prisma Data Proxy does not yet support the preview features `interactiveTransactions` and `metrics`.

## Availability and SLOs

The [Prisma Status](https://www.prisma-status.com/) page shows information about:

- current status of the platform
- current and historical uptime of the Prisma Data Proxy in all supported locations
- current and historical uptime of the Platform Control Plane (Web interface and API)
- log of past incidents

The SLO (service-level objective) of the Prisma Data Platform is to provide at least 99.95% availability.
