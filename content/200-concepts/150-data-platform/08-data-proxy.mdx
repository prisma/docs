<TopBlock>

The Prisma Data Proxy provides connection management and pooling for database connections, so that your environment can efficiently scale up to more database connections from your serverless application as needed. Using the Data Proxy also enables you to maintain predictable database performance, by limiting the number of total connections allowed.

</TopBlock>

## About the Prisma Data Proxy

Serverless functions are ephemeral and short-lived, so their database connections are numerous and brief.

Because of this, using traditional databases in serverless functions often leads to exhausting the limit of concurrent database connections and increased latencies on each request to establish a database connection.

## Using the Data Proxy in a Prisma application

We assume you already have an account and a project on [the Prisma Data Platform](https://cloud.prisma.io). If you don't, sign up using your GitHub account before continuing.

#### Step 1. Generate a Data Proxy connection string

Navigate to the **Data Proxy** tab of your Prisma Data Platform project, select the desired proxy location, and click **Enable**.

> The Data Proxy is currently available in the AWS&nbsp;Frankfurt (eu-central-1) and N.&nbsp;Virginia (us-east-1) regions. If you'd like support for other providers or regions, [we'd love to hear from you](https://pris.ly/proxy-new-region).

Copy the connection string and store it securely, similarly to how you would treat a database credential. You may generate more connection strings in this section if you wish and of course, revoke them if you don't need them anymore.

Connection strings always have the following format:

```
prisma://{DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION}.prisma-data.com/?api_key={DATA_PROXY_API_KEY}
```

**Note:** When you use the Data Proxy, your connection string must begin with `prisma://`, as described above. Do not use the direct connection string to your PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other database.

#### Step 2. Install up-to-date Prisma dependencies

To use the Data Proxy, use the version `3.3.0` or higher of the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` npm packages.

```terminal
npm install prisma@latest --save-dev
npm install @prisma/client@latest --save
```

#### Step 3: Make sure that the datasource URL is read from environment

<Admonition type="warning">

Currently, the only supported datasource name is `db`. Make sure your `schema.prisma` file includes the `datasource db` block.

</Admonition>

##### Node.js

If you want to use Node.js, then we strongly recommend that you use environment variables to provide your database connection strings:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

##### Vercel Edge

##### Cloudflare Workers

If you want to use CloudFlare Workers then
**!!!! (use global variables) - explanation to go here!!!**

#### Step 4: Generate the client

To generate the client with the Data Proxy, call `prisma generate` with the option `--data=proxy`:

```terminal
prisma generate --data proxy
```

The Data Proxy does not need binaries. To keep Prisma Client lightweight, when you use this command the [query engine](/concepts/components/prisma-engines/query-engine) does not copy any binaries to Prisma Client.

#### Step 5: Import and instantiate Prisma Client in your code

If you want to use the Data Proxy with Node.js, then use `@prisma/client` as described in [Generating the client](/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/generating-prisma-client).

If you want to use the Data Proxy with CloudFlare Workers or the Vercel Edge Functions, you will need to import and instantiate Prisma Client in your code as follows.

 <TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="TypeScript" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="JavaScript" icon="code"/>]}>

 <tab>

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

  </tab>

  <tab>

```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

#### Step 6: Start your app

If you are loading the connection string in your Prisma Schema using `env()`, there should be no further changes needed other than verifying that the environment variable changed to your Data Proxy connection string. For example:

```terminal
DATABASE_URL='prisma://aws-us-east-1.prisma-data.com/?api_key=...' npm start
```

For guidance on how to configure environment variables on your deployment, please refer to your provider.

- Heroku: [Configuration and Config Vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)

### Error codes

Because Data Proxy connections operate differently from a local database connection, error codes will be different from regular ones. In general, all Data Proxy-related errors will start with `P5xxx`.

<Admonition type="warning">

**Subject to change**<br />
Please note that the Prisma Data Proxy public interface is not stable yet. The listed codes may be changed at any time without notice.

</Admonition>

#### P5000

This request could not be understood by the server

#### P5001

This request must be retried

#### P5002

The datasource provided is invalid:

- Could not parse the URL
- Could not parse URL of the datasource. Datasource URL must use `prisma://` protocol when `--data-proxy` is used. No valid API key found in the datasource URL
- No valid API key found

#### P5003

Requested resource does not exist

#### P5004

The feature is not yet implemented:

- `beforeExit` event is not yet supported
- Interactive transactions are not yet supported

#### P5005

Schema needs to be uploaded

#### P5006

Unknown server error

#### P5007

Unauthorized, check your connection string

#### P5008

Usage exceeded, retry again later

#### P5009

Request timed out

### Important Considerations about the Data Proxy

#### Providing the connection string to Prisma Migrate

Currently, the Data Proxy can only be used to query your database with [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client).

Migrations can be only be run on a direct (non-proxied) database connection. Assuming that your schema uses `env("DATABASE_URL")`, you'll need to override the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable before running `prisma migrate`. You can declare another environment variable, for example `MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL`, and use it that to override the connection:

```js
// package.json
{
  ...,
  "scripts": {
    "generate-client": "prisma generate --data-proxy",
    "migrate": "DATABASE_URL=\"$MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL\" prisma migrate deploy",
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Deploying to Vercel

Our Vercel Deployment sample repository has a [branch](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-vercel/tree/data-proxy) showing how to deploy a Prisma application to Vercel using the Data Proxy.

[Use this link to create a Vercel project based on this branch](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fprisma%2Fdeployment-example-vercel%2Ftree%2Fdata-proxy&env=DATABASE_URL,MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL&envDescription=DATABASE_URL%20-%20proxy%20URL%2C%20MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL%20-%20direct%20connection%20string&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fprismaio%2FPrisma-Data-Proxy-Early-Access-Program-EAP-8ca06a8b350340e3a6236689375d071e) .

#### Deploying to Cloudflare Workers

The Prisma Data Proxy allows you to deploy Prisma projects to Cloudflare Workers. To learn more, check out the [Cloudflare Workers deployment guide](/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-cloudflare-workers).

#### Connecting to a database hosted with a provider different than AWS

It's possible to connect to a database hosted on any provider, but it needs to be accessible from the public internet. For best results and response times, you should configure the proxy in a region that is the same or as close as possible to the database.

We are looking to expand the number of providers and regions in the future. If a region or provider is not yet supported, you can [submit a request](https://pris.ly/proxy-new-region). This will help us prioritize providers and regions to add next.

#### Connection limits

We recommend using a database that supports at least 20 concurrent connections.
Setting a concurrency limit on AWS Lambda should not be required, but you should be aware that, if necessary, requests will be queued until they can be processed.

#### Proxy Limits

The limits for running multiple schemas concurrently during Early Access are:

- Up to 3 schemas can be used concurrently in a single Prisma app (for example: while updating your app to a new schema version)
- Up to 5 schemas can be used concurrently account-wide

The Data Proxy is architected to seamlessly scale to support large workloads, but during the Early Access period there will be a fairly low scale limit. The actual performance for a single schema using the Data Proxy will depend on a large number of variables (the type of queries, latencies and deployment locations, the performance of your database, ...). The Data Proxy will not yield more than **200 requests per second**, though the number of requests wil likely be well below 200 per second.

If you are looking to scale up traffic beyond the limits or if you're seeing `429` HTTP errors in your logs - this might mean you're hitting the quotas; [**please reach out to us**](/concepts/data-platform#feedback-and-support). We'd love to know about your use case and work together with you to help your Prisma application scale.

#### Pricing of the Data Proxy

The Data Proxy is provided for free during Early Access.

We will use the Early Access phase to learn about usage and tweak the pricing model.

When the Prisma Data Platform is launched in General Availability, there will be an option to continue using the Data Proxy with a generous free tier, alongside paid options.

#### Availability, Usage for Testing purposes only

We do not expect long-planned downtime periods, but we also do not provide an SLA during Early Access. As an Early Access feature, the Data Proxy is not considered stable and it should not be used in production.
