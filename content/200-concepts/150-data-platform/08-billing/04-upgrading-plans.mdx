metaTitle: 'Upgrading plans'
metaDescription: 'You can upgrade to a paid plan to increase the Prisma Data Proxy usage and the number of team members and environments that you can add to your project.'
---

<TopBlock>

Each project you create in the Prisma Data Platform starts on the **Free** plan.

<Admonition>

**Note**<br /><br />
Projects created before June 15th, 2022 start on the [**Early Adopter**](/concepts/data-platform/billing/early-adopter-plan) plan.

</Admonition>

While the **Free** plan allows you to create your proof-of-concept or iterate on the first development phases of your Prisma project, it does so with a few limitations. Based on that, you might want to upgrade to a paid plan in a number of scenarios.

- You want to have more team members on your project than the **Free** (or **Early Adopter**) plan allows.
- You need specific roles for team members (**Viewer**, **Developer**, **Collaborator**).
- You want to have more environments that the **Free** (or **Early Adopter**) plan allows.
- You exceeded or are concerned about exceeding the Data Proxy usage quota in the **Free** plan.
- If you have a project that is on the **Early Adopter** plan, it can benefit from removing the concurrency limitation when using the Data Proxy

## Considerations and prerequisites

Only project owners (creators) can upgrade a project to a paid plan.

## Upgrade to <strong>Scale</strong> plan

If you have a Prisma project which is currently on an **Early Adopter** or **Free** plan, and you want to increase the quota of environments, collaborators, and the Prisma Data Proxy CPU usage, you can do so by upgrading to the **Scale** plan.

**Steps**

1. Go to the [**Billing**](https://cloud.prisma.io/billing) page.
2. Click **Upgrade** for the project you want to upgrade.
3. Select the **Scale** plan and click **Review Details**.
4. Click **Pay Now and Upgrade**.

**Result**

Your project is now upgraded to the **Scale** plan.

## Upgrade to <strong>Enterprise</strong> plan

An **Enterprise** plan can be custom-made and allows teams of all sizes to establish the number of environments and collaborators needed, as well as benefit from a custom amount of Prisma Data Proxy CPU usage that makes the most sense for a Prisma project.

**Steps**

1. Go to the [**Billing**](https://cloud.prisma.io/billing) page.
2. Click **Upgrade** for a project you want to upgrade.
3. Select the **Enterprise** plan and click **Contact Sales**.

**Result**
