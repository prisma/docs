Prisma is an ORM that provides a fully type-safe API and simplified database access. You can use Prisma tools to build a GraphQL or REST API, or as part of a fullstack application - the extent to which you incorporate Prisma is up to you.

<Tip>

If you are building a GraphQL API, check out [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/) - code first GraphQL schemas with [a plugin specifically for Prisma](https://nxs.li/plugins/prisma).
