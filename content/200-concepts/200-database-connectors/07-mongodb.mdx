The MongoDB data source connector connects Prisma to a hosted [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance.

## Example

To connect to a MongoDB server, you need to configure a [`datasource`](../components/prisma-schema/data-sources) block in your [Prisma schema file](../components/prisma-schema):

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The fields passed to the `datasource` block are:

- `provider`: Specifies the `mongodb` data source connector.
- `url`: Specifies the [connection URL](#connection-url) for the MongoDB server. In this case, an [environment variable is used](../more/environment-variables) to provide the connection URL.

<Admonition type="warning">

The MongoDB database connector uses transactions to support nested writes. Transactions **requires** a [replica set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/) deployment. The easiest way to deploy a replica set is with [Atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/). It's free to get started.

Because MongoDB is currently a preview feature, you need to explicitly define that in the [`generator`]() block.

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["mongoDb"]
}
```

## Connection details

### Connection URL

The MongoDB connection URL can be configured in different ways depending on how you are hosting your database. The standard configuration is made up of the following components:

![Structure of the MongoDB connection URL](./mongodb.png)

#### Base URL and path

The base URL and path sections of the connection URL are made up of your authentication credentials followed by the host (and optionally, a port number) and database.

```
mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE
```

The following components make up the _base URL_ of your database:

| Name     | Placeholder | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User     | `USERNAME`  | Name of your database user, e.g. `janedoe`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Password | `PASSWORD`  | Password for your database user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Host     | `HOST`      | The host where a [`mongod`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod) instance is running. If you are running a sharded cluster this will a [`mongos`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos) instance. This can be a hostname, IP address or UNIX domain socket. |
| Port     | `PORT`      | Port on which your database server is running, e.g. `1234`. If none is provided the default `27017` is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Database | `DATABASE`  | Name of the database to use. If none is specified but the `authSource` option is set then the `authSource` database name is used. If neither the database in the connection string nor the `authSource` option is specified then it defaults to `admin`                                                                                                    |

You must [percentage-encode special characters](../../../reference/database-reference/connection-urls#special-characters).

#### Arguments

A connection URL can also take arguments. The following example sets three arguments:

- An `ssl` connection
- A `connectTimeoutMS`
- And the `maxPoolSize`

```
mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?ssl=true&connectTimeoutMS=5000&maxPoolSize=50
```

Refer to the [MongoDB connection string documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options) for a complete list of connection string arguments. There are no Prisma-specific arguments.

## Using <inlinecode>ObjectId</inlinecode>

It is common practice for the `_id` field of a MongoDB document to contain an `ObjectId`:

```json
{
  "_id": { "$oid": "60d599cb001ef98000f2cad2" },
  "createdAt": { "$date": { "$numberLong": "1624611275577" } },
  "email": "ella@prisma.io",
  "name": "Ella",
  "role": "ADMIN"
}
```

Any field (most commonly IDs and relation scalar fields) that maps to an `ObjectId` in the underlying database:

- Must be of type `String` or `Bytes`
- Must include the `@db.ObjectId` attribute
- Can optionally use `@default(dbgenerated())` to auto-generate a valid `ObjectId`

```prisma
model User {
  id  String  @id @default(dbgenerated()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  // Other fields
}
```

```prisma
model User {
  id  Bytes  @id @default(dbgenerated()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  // Other fields
}
```

See also: [Defining ID fields in MongoDB](../components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-ids-in-mongodb)

### Generating `ObjectId`

To generate a valid `ObjectId` (for testing purposes or to manually set an ID field value), use the `bson` package.

```ts
import { ObjectId } from 'bson'

const id = new ObjectId()
```

## Known limitations

As MongoDB support is currently in preview there are some known limitations that come with adopting Prisma into your MongoDB project, these include:

- Currently **no embedded collection support**. See [github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6708](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6708).
  - Instead try to [normalize your data models](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/data-model-design/#normalized-data-models). This involves
    describing relationships using references between documents.
- The [Migrate](../components/prisma-migrate) and [Introspection](../components/introspection) workflows are currently **not** supported.
- [`@@id`](../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#id-1) and [auto-increment](../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#generate-auto-incrementing-integers-as-ids) are **not** currently supported.
- Error handling is incomplete.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Transactions are not supported by this deployment

MongoDB only allows you to start a transaction on a replica set. Prisma uses transactions internally to avoid partial writes on nested queries. This means we inherit the requirement of needing a replica set configured.

When you try to use Prisma's MongoDB connector on a deployment that has no replica set configured, you can experience an error message as the following:

```
PrismaClientUnknownRequestError2 [PrismaClientUnknownRequestError]:
Invalid `prisma.post.create()` invocation in
/index.ts:9:21

   6 await prisma.$connect()
   7
   8 // Create the first post
→  9 await prisma.post.create(
  Error in connector: Database error. error code: unknown, error message: Transactions are not supported by this deployment
    at cb (/node_modules/@prisma/client/runtime/index.js:34804:17)
    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:97:5) {
  clientVersion: '2.xx.0'
}
```

To resolve this, we suggest you change your deployment to one with a replica set configured.

One simple way for this is to use use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to launch a free instance that has replica set support out of the box.

There's also an option to run the replica set locally with this guide: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set
