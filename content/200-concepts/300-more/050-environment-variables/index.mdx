You can use environment variables to provide configuration options when a CLI command is invoked. Environment variables allow you to:

- Keep secrets out of the schema file
- Improve portability of the schema file

You can use machine-specific variables, `.env` files, or a combination of both.

## Using .env files

For many developer tools, it has become a good practice to define environment variables using [`.env`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) files. The Prisma CLI, and Client, looks for `.env` files, in order, in the following locations:

1. In the root folder of your project (`./.env`)
1. From the same folder as the schema specified by the `--schema` argument
1. From the same folder as the schema taken from `"prisma": {"schema": "/path/to/schema.prisma"}` in `package.json`
1. From the `./prisma` folder

If a `.env` file is located in step #1, but additional, clashing `.env` variables are located in steps #2 - 4, the CLI will throw an error. For example, if you specify a `DATABASE_URL` variable in two different `.env` files, you will get the following error:

```
Error: There is a conflict between env vars in .env and prisma/.env
Conflicting env vars:
  DATABASE_URL

We suggest to move the contents of prisma/.env to .env to consolidate your env vars.
```

The following table describes where the Prisma CLI looks for the `.env` file:

| **Command**                                     | **Schema file location**                                                        | **`.env` file locations checked, in order**               |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prisma [command]`                              | `./prisma/schema.prisma`                                                        | `./.env`<br />`./prisma/.env`                             |
| `prisma [command] --schema=./a/b/schema.prisma` | `./a/b/schema.prisma`                                                           | `./.env`<br />`./a/b/.env`<br />`./prisma/.env`           |
| `prisma [command]`                              | `"prisma": {"schema": "/path/to/schema.prisma"}`                                | `.env`<br /> `./path/to/schema/.env`<br />`./prisma/.env` |
| `prisma [command]`                              | No schema (for example, when running `prisma introspect` in an empty directory) | `./.env`<br />`./prisma/.env`                             |

Any environment variables defined in that `.env` file will automatically be loaded when running a Prisma CLI command.

<Admonition type="warning">

**Do not commit your `.env` files into version control**!

</Admonition>

Refer to the `dotenv` documentation for information about [what happens if an environment variable is defined in two places](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#what-happens-to-environment-variables-that-were-already-set).

### Example: Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in an `.env` file

It is common to load your database connection URL from an environment variable:

```prisma
// schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

You can set the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file:

```
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test?schema=public
```

Variables can be expanded using the format specified by [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand). This is useful when dealing with PaaS or similar products. such as Heroku):

```
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test
DATABASE_URL_WITH_SCHEMA=${DATABASE_URL}?schema=public
```

When you run a command that needs access to the database defined via the `datasource` block (for example, `prisma introspect`), the Prisma CLI automatically loads the `DATABASE_URL` environment variables from the `.env` file and makes it available to the CLI.

### Using environment variables in your code

If you want environment variables to be evaluated at runtime, you need to load them manually in your application code (for example, by using [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)):

```ts
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config() // Load the environment variables
console.log(`The connection URL is ${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`)
```
