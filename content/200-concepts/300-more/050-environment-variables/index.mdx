An environment variable is a key value pair of string data stored on your machine's local environment.

Traditionally the name of the variable is uppercase, this is then followed by an equals sign then the value of the variable:

```env
MY_VALUE=prisma
```

The environment variable belongs to the environment where a process is running. 

Taking the `TEMP` environment variable as an example, one can query its value to find where to store temporary files. This is a system environment variable and can be queried by any process or application running on the machine.

## How does Prisma use environment variables?

Prisma always reads environment variables from the system's environment. 

When you install Prisma for the first time it creates a convenience `.env` file for you to set your [`connection url`](../../../reference/database-reference/connection-urls) as an environment variable. When you use Prisma CLI or Prisma Client, the `.env` file content and the variables defined in there are put into the system's environment, where Prisma can read it and use it.

Looking to use more than one `.env` file? See [Using multiple `.env` files](./using-multiple-env-files) for information on how to setup and use multiple `.env` files in your application.

## Using <inlinecode>.env</inlinecode> files

Prisma creates a default `.env` file at your projects root. You can choose to replace this file or create a new one in the `prisma` folder, or if you choose to relocate your `prisma.schema` file, alongside that.

### `.env` file locations

The Prisma CLI looks for `.env` files, in order, in the following locations:

1. In the root folder of your project (`./.env`)
1. From the same folder as the schema specified by the `--schema` argument
1. From the same folder as the schema taken from `"prisma": {"schema": "/path/to/schema.prisma"}` in `package.json`
1. From the `./prisma` folder

If a `.env` file is located in step #1, but additional, clashing `.env` variables are located in steps #2 - 4, the CLI will throw an error. For example, if you specify a `DATABASE_URL` variable in two different `.env` files, you will get the following error:

```
Error: There is a conflict between env vars in .env and prisma/.env
Conflicting env vars:
  DATABASE_URL

We suggest to move the contents of prisma/.env to .env to consolidate your env vars.
```

The following table describes where the Prisma CLI looks for the `.env` file:

| **Command**                                     | **Schema file location**                                                        | **`.env` file locations checked, in order**               |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prisma [command]`                              | `./prisma/schema.prisma`                                                        | `./.env`<br />`./prisma/.env`                             |
| `prisma [command] --schema=./a/b/schema.prisma` | `./a/b/schema.prisma`                                                           | `./.env`<br />`./a/b/.env`<br />`./prisma/.env`           |
| `prisma [command]`                              | `"prisma": {"schema": "/path/to/schema.prisma"}`                                | `.env`<br /> `./path/to/schema/.env`<br />`./prisma/.env` |
| `prisma [command]`                              | No schema (for example, when running `prisma introspect` in an empty directory) | `./.env`<br />`./prisma/.env`                             |

Any environment variables defined in that `.env` file will automatically be loaded when running a Prisma CLI command.

<Admonition type="warning">

**Do not commit your `.env` files into version control**!

Refer to the `dotenv` documentation for information about [what happens if an environment variable is defined in two places](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#what-happens-to-environment-variables-that-were-already-set).

### Expanding variables

Variables stored in `.env` files can be expanded using the format specified by [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand). This is useful when dealing with PaaS or similar products. such as Heroku):

```
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test
DATABASE_URL_WITH_SCHEMA=${DATABASE_URL}?schema=public
```

### Example: Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in an `.env` file

It is common to load your database connection URL from an environment variable:

```prisma
// schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

You can set the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file:

```
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test?schema=public
```

When you run a command that needs access to the database defined via the `datasource` block (for example, `prisma introspect`), the Prisma CLI automatically loads the `DATABASE_URL` environment variables from the `.env` file and makes it available to the CLI.

### Using environment variables in your code

If you want environment variables to be evaluated at runtime, you need to load them manually in your application code (for example, by using [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)):

```ts
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config() // Load the environment variables
console.log(`The connection URL is ${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`)
```
