There is a risk that your production database could be deleted if you store different connection URLs to each of your environments within a single `.env` file.

One solution is to have multiple `.env` files which each represent different environments. In practice this means you create a file for each of your environments:

- `.env.development`
- `.env.test`

<Admonition type="warning">

`.env.production` is omitted from the above list as it's is not recommended to store your production credentials locally, even if they are git ignored.

</Admonition>

Then using a package like [`dotenv-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli), you can load the correct connection URL for the environment you are working in.

## Setup multiple `.env` files

For the purpose of this guide it is assumed you have a dedicated development database which you use whilst developing your application.

1. Rename your `.env` file to `.env.development`

```env file=.env.development
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://prisma:prisma@localhost:5433/dev"
```

2. Create a new `.env.test` file and change the database name to test (or your preferred name)

```env file=.env.test
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://prisma:prisma@localhost:5433/tests"
```

3. Install [`dotenv-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli)

In order for Prisma and Jest to know which `.env` file to use, alter your package.json scripts to include and call the `dotenv` package and specify which file to use depending on what commands you are running and in which environment you want them to run.

<Admonition type="info">

Any top level script that is running the tests and migrations needs the dotenv command before it. This makes sure that the env variables from `.env.test` are passed to all commands including Jest.

### Running migrations on different environments

You can use the [`dotenv-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli) package to specify which environment file Prisma should use when running a migration.

The below script uses `dotenv-cli` to pass the `.env.test` environment file (which holds a `DATABASE_URL` connection string) to the Prisma migration script.

#### Migration script

```json file=package.json
  "scripts": {
    "migrate:postgres": "dotenv -e .env.test -- npx prisma migrate dev --name postgres-init",
  },
```

### Running tests on different environments

When running tests we advice you to [mock the Prisma Client](../../../guides/testing/unit-testing#mocking-the-prisma-client), in doing so you need to tell Jest which environment it should use when running its tests.

By default the Prisma Client will use the environment specified in the default `.env` file located at the projects root.

If you have created a separate `.env.test` file to specify your testing database, then this environment will need to be passed to Jest.

The below script uses `dotenv-cli` to pass the `.env.test` environment file (which holds a `DATABASE_URL` connection string) to Jest.

#### Test script

```json file=package.json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "dotenv -e .env.test jest -i"
  },
```
