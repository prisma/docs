## Overview

The term **telemetry** refers to the collection of certain usage data to help _improve the quality of a piece of software_. Prisma uses telemetry in two contexts:

- when it collects CLI usage data
- when it submits CLI error reports

This page describes the overall telemetry approach for Prisma, what kind of data is collected and how to opt-out of data collection.

## Why does Prisma collect metrics?

Telemetry helps us better understand _how many users_ are using our products and _how often_ they are using our products. Unlike many telemetry services, our telemetry implementation is intentionally limited in scope and is actually useful for the developer:

- **Limited in scope**: We use telemetry to answer one question: how many monthly active developers are using Prisma CLI?
- **Provides value**: Our telemetry service also checks for version updates and offers security notices.

## When is data collected?

Data is collected in two scenarios that are described below.

### Usage data

Invocations of the `prisma` CLI and general usage of Studio results in data being sent to the telemetry server at https://checkpoint.prisma.io. Note that:

- The data does **not** include your schema or the data in your database
- Prisma only sends information after you execute a CLI command

Here is an overview of the data that's being submitted:

|          Field | Attributes | Description                                                                            |
| -------------: | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      `product` |  _string_  | Name of the product (e.g. `prisma`)                                                    |
|      `version` |  _string_  | Currently installed version of the product (e.g. `1.0.0-rc0`)                          |
|         `arch` |  _string_  | Client's operating system architecture (e.g. `amd64`).                                 |
|           `os` |  _string_  | Client's operating system (e.g. `darwin`).                                             |
| `node_version` |  _string_  | Client's node version (e.g. `v12.12.0`).                                               |
|    `signature` |  _string_  | Random, non-identifiable signature UUID (e.g. `91b014df3-9dda-4a27-a8a7-15474fd899f8`) |
|   `user_agent` |  _string_  | User agent of the checkpoint client (e.g. `prisma/js-checkpoint`)                      |
|    `timestamp` |  _string_  | When the request was made in RFC3339 format (e.g. `2019-12-12T17:45:56Z`)              |

You can opt-out of this behavior by setting the `CHECKPOINT_DISABLE` environment variable to `1`, e.g.:

```terminal
export CHECKPOINT_DISABLE=1
```

### Error reporting

Prisma potentially collects error data when there is a crash in the CLI.

Before an error report is submitted, there will _always_ be a prompt asking you to confirm or deny the submission of the error report! Error reports are never submitted without your explicit consent!

## How to opt-out of data collection?

### Usage data

You can opt-out of usage data collection by setting the `CHECKPOINT_DISABLE` environment variable to `1`, e.g.:

```terminal
export CHECKPOINT_DISABLE=1
```

### Error reporting

You can opt-out of data collection by responding to the interactive prompt with _no_.
