## Built-in drivers (default)

One of Prisma Client's component's is the [Query Engine](./prisma-engines/query-engine) <span class="concept"></span>. The Query Engine is responsible for transforming Prisma Client queries to SQL statements. The Query Engine connects to your database using the included drivers that don't require additional setup. The built-in drivers use TCP connections to connect to the database.

## Driver adapters

Prisma Client can connect and run queries against your database using other JavaScript database drivers using **driver adapters**. Adapters act as _translators_ between Prisma Client and the JavaScript database driver.

Prisma will use the Query Engine to transform the Prisma Client query to SQL and run the generated SQL queries via the JavaScript database driver.

Prisma maintains the following driver adapters:

- [Neon](#neon-serverless-driver)
- [PlanetScale](#planetscale-serverless-driver)
- [Turso](#turso)

To use this feature:

1. Update the `previewFeatures` block in your schema to include the the `driverAdapters` preview feature:

   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider        = "prisma-client-js"
     previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
   }
   ```

2. Generate Prisma Client:

   ```sh
   npx prisma generate
   ```

### Serverless drivers

Several database providers enable the use of different protocols, such as HTTP and WebSocket, to connect to your database. Example database providers include Neon and PlanetScale.

#### Neon Serverless Driver

Install the Prisma driver adapter for Neon, Neon serverless driver and `ws` packages:

```sh
npm install @prisma/adapter-neon @neondatabase/serverless ws
```

Update your Prisma Client instance:

```ts
import { Pool, neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless'
import { PrismaNeon } from '@prisma/adapter-neon'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
import ws from 'ws'

dotenv.config()
neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws
const connectionString = `${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString })
const adapter = new PrismaNeon(pool)
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

We would appreciate your feedback on the Neon serverless driver adapter. Let us know what you think by leaving a comment in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/21346).

#### PlanetScale Serverless Driver

Install the Prisma driver adapter for PlanetScale, PlanetScale serverless driver and undici packages:

```sh
npm install @prisma/adapter-planetscale @planetscale/database undici
```

Update your Prisma Client instance:

```ts
import { connect } from '@planetscale/database'
import { PrismaPlanetScale } from '@prisma/adapter-planetscale'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
import { fetch as undiciFetch } from 'undici'

dotenv.config()
const connectionString = `${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`

const connection = connect({ url: connectionString, fetch: undiciFetch })
const adapter = new PrismaPlanetScale(connection)
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

We would appreciate your feedback on the PlanetScale serverless driver adapter. Let us know what you think by leaving a comment in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/21347).

### Database drivers

{/* * TODO: intro note here */}

#### Turso (Early Access)

Install the Prisma driver adapter for LibSQL and LibSQL packages:

```sh
npm install @prisma/adapter-libsql @libsql/client
```

Update your Prisma Client instance:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaLibSQL } from '@prisma/adapter-libsql'
import { createClient } from '@libsql/client'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config()

const libsql = createClient({
  url: `${process.env.TURSO_DATABASE_URL}`,
  authToken: `${process.env.TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN}`,
})

const adapter = new PrismaLibSQL(libsql)
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

We would appreciate your feedback on the Turso database driver adapter. Let us know what you think by leaving a comment in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/21345).
