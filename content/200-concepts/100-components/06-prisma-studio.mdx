Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database. Note that Prisma Studio is not open source but you can still create issues in the [`prisma/studio`](https://github.com/prisma/studio) repo.

Run `$ npx prisma studio` in your terminal.

**Note**<br /><br />
The features of Prisma Studio are similar to those in the Data Browser in the Prisma Data Platform. See the [Data Browser](/data-platform/data-browser) documentation.

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal: Failed to run script / Error in Prisma Client request

Caching issues may cause Prisma Studio to use an older version of the query engine. You may see the following error:

```
Error in request:  PrismaClientKnownRequestError: Failed to validate the query Error occurred during query validation & transformation
```

To resolve, delete the following folders:

- `~/.cache/prisma` on macOS and Linux
- `%AppData%/Prisma/Studio` on Windows
