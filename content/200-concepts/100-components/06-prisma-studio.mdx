Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database. Note that Prisma Studio is not open source but you can still create issues in the [`prisma/studio`](https://github.com/prisma/studio) repo.

You can run it with two ways:

1. Run `$ npx prisma studio` in your terminal.
2. Install [the desktop app](https://github.com/prisma/studio/releases) from the installers. Windows, macOS and Linux are supported.

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal: Failed to run script / Error in Prisma Client request

Caching issues may cause Prisma Studio to use an older version of the query engine. You may see the following error:

```
Error in request:  PrismaClientKnownRequestError: Failed to validate the query Error occurred during query validation & transformation
```

To resolve, delete the following folders:

- `~/.cache/prisma` on macOS and Linux
- `%AppData%/Prisma/Studio` on Windows
