From a technical perspective, Prisma Client consists of three major components:

- JavaScript client library
- TypeScript type definitions
- A query engine

All of these components are located in the [generated `.prisma/client` folder](../prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/generating-prisma-client#the-prismaclient-npm-package) after you ran `prisma generate`.

This page covers relevant technical details about the query engine.

## The query engine file

The **query engine file** is different for each operating system. It is named `query-engine-PLATFORM` or `libquery_engine-PLATFORM` where `PLATFORM` corresponds to the name of a compile target. Query engine file extensions depend on the platform as well. As an example, if the query engine must run on a [Darwin](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)>) operating system such as macOS, it is called `libquery_engine-darwin.dylib.node` or `query-engine-darwin`. You can find an overview of all supported platforms [here](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options).

The query engine file is downloaded into the `runtime` directory of the generated Prisma Client when `prisma generate` is called.

Note that the query engine is implemented in Rust. The source code is located in the [`prisma-engines`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/) repository.

## The query engine at runtime

By default, the Prisma Client loads the query engine as a [Node-API library](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html). You can alternatively [configure Prisma to use the query engine compiled as an executable binary](#configuring-the-query-engine), which is run as a sidecar process alongside your application. 
The Node-API library approach is recommended since it reduces the communication overhead between the Prisma Client and the query engine.

![Diagram showing the query engine and Node.js at runtime](https://res.cloudinary.com/prismaio/image/upload/v1628764883/docs/1YmOJpx_ao1wft.png)

The query engine is started when the first Prisma Client query is invoked or when the [`$connect()`](../prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-management) method is called on your `PrismaClient` instance. Once the query engine is started, it creates a [connection pool](../prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-pool) and manages the physical connections to the database. From that point onwards, the Prisma Client is ready to send [queries](../prisma-client/crud) to the database (e.g. `findUnique`, `findMany`, `create`, ...).

The query engine is stopped and the database connections are closed when [`$disconnect()`](../prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-management) is invoked.

The following diagram depicts a "typical flow":

1. `$connect()` is invoked on Prisma Client
1. The query engine is started
1. The query engine establishes connections to the database and creates connection pool
1. Prisma Client is now ready to send queries to the database
1. Prisma Client sends a `findMany()` query to the query engine
1. The query engine translates the query into SQL and sends it to the database
1. The query engine receives the SQL response from the database
1. The query engine returns the result as plain old JavaScript objects to Prisma Client
1. `$disconnect()` is invoked on Prisma Client
1. The query engine closes the database connections
1. The query engine is stopped

## Responsibilities of the query engine

The query engine has the following responsibilities in an application that uses Prisma Client:

- manage physical database connections in connection pool
- receive incoming queries from the Prisma Client Node.js process
- generate SQL queries
- send SQL queries to the database
- process responses from the database and send them back to Prisma Client

## Debugging the query engine

You can access the logs of the query engine by setting the [`DEBUG`](../prisma-client/debugging) environment variable to `engine`:

```terminal
export DEBUG="engine"
```

You can also get more visibility into the SQL queries that are generated by the query engine by setting the [`query` log level](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#log-levels) in Prisma Client:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: ['query'],
})
```

## Configuring the query engine

### Defining the query engine type for Prisma Client

[As described above](#the-query-engine-at-runtime) the default query engine is a Node-API library that is loaded into Prisma Client, but there is also an alternative implementation as an executable binary that runs in its own process. You can configure the query engine type by providing the `engineType` property to the Prisma Client `generator`:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider   = "prisma-client-js"
  engineType = "binary"
}
```

Valid values for `engineType` are `binary` and `library`. You can also use the environment variable [`PRISMA_CLIENT_ENGINE_TYPE`](../../../reference/api-reference/environment-variables-reference#prisma_client_engine_type) instead.

<Admonition type="info">

- Until Prisma 3.x the default and only engine type available was `binary`, so there was no way to configure the engine type to be used by Prisma Client and Prisma CLI.
- From versions [2.20.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/2.20.0) to 3.x the `library` engine type was available and used by default by [activating the preview feature flag](../concepts/components/preview-features/client-preview-features#enabling-a-prisma-client-preview-feature) "`nApi`" or using the `PRISMA_FORCE_NAPI=true` environment variable.

</Admonition>

### Defining the query engine type for Prisma CLI

Prisma CLI also uses its own query engine for its own needs. You can configure it to use the binary version of the query engine by defining the environment variable [`PRISMA_CLI_QUERY_ENGINE_TYPE=binary`](../../../reference/api-reference/environment-variables-reference#prisma_cli_query_engine_type).
