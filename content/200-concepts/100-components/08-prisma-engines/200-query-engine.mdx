From a technical perspective, Prisma Client consists of three major components:

- JavaScript client library
- TypeScript type definitions
- A query engine

All of these components are located in the [generated `.prisma/client` folder](../prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/generating-prisma-client#the-prismaclient-npm-package) after you ran `prisma generate`.

This page covers relevant technical details about the query engine.

## The query engine file

The **query engine file** is different for each operating system. It is named `query-engine-PLATFORM` or `libquery_engine-PLATFORM` where `PLATFORM` corresponds to the name of a compile target, file extensions vary and are dependent on the platform as well. For example, if the query engine must run on a [Darwin](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)>) operating system (e.g. Mac OS), it's called `libquery_engine-darwin.dylib.node` or `query-engine-darwin`. You can find an overview of all supported platforms [here](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options).

The query engine file is downloaded into the `runtime` directory of the generated Prisma Client when `prisma generate` is called.

Note that the query engine is implemented in Rust. The source code is located in the [`prisma-engines`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/) repository.

## The query engine at runtime

The query engine is a [Node-API library](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) that is loaded into the Prisma Client library. (There is also is also another engine type for the query engine that is compiled to an executable binary, that is run as a sidecar process alongside your application. Read more about [configuring the query engine](#configuring-the-query-engine). Compared to the binary method, the Node-API library a newer technique for binding Prisma's Rust-based query engine directly to Prisma Client. This reduces the communication overhead between the Node.js and Rust layers when resolving Prisma Client's database queries, so is usually beneficial to use.)

![Diagram showing the query engine and Node.js at runtime](https://res.cloudinary.com/prismaio/image/upload/v1628764883/docs/1YmOJpx_ao1wft.png)

The query engine is started when the [`$connect()`](../prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-management) method (or the first Prisma Client Query, which implicitly calls `$connect()`) is called on your `PrismaClient` instance. Once the engine is started, the query engine creates a [connection pool](../prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-pool) and manages the physical connections to the database. From that point onwards, Prisma Client is ready to send [queries](../prisma-client/crud) to the database (e.g. `findUnique`, `findMany`, `create`, ...).

The query engine is stopped and the database connections are closed when [`$disconnect()`](../prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-management) is invoked.

The following diagram depicts a "typical flow":

1. `$connect()` is invoked on Prisma Client
1. The query engine is started
1. The query engine establishes connections to the database and creates connection pool
1. Prisma Client is now ready to send queries to the database
1. Prisma Client sends a `findMany()` query to the query engine
1. The query engine translates the query into SQL and sends it to the database
1. The query engine receives the SQL response from the database
1. The query engine returns the result as plain old JavaScript objects to Prisma Client
1. `$disconnect()` is invoked on Prisma Client
1. The query engine closes the database connections
1. The query engine is stopped

## Responsibilities of the query engine

The query engine has the following responsibilities in an application that uses Prisma Client:

- manage physical database connections in connection pool
- receive incoming queries from the Prisma Client Node.js process
- generate SQL queries
- send SQL queries to the database
- process responses from the database and send them back to Prisma Client

## Debugging the query engine

You can access the logs of the query engine by setting the [`DEBUG`](../prisma-client/debugging) environment variable to `engine`:

```terminal
export DEBUG="engine"
```

You can also get more visibility into the SQL queries that are generated by the query engine by setting the [`query` log level](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#log-levels) in Prisma Client:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: ['query'],
})
```

## Configuring the query engine

### Defining the query engine type for Prisma Client

[As described above](#the-query-engine-at-runtime) the default query engine is a Node-API library that is loaded into Prisma Client, but there is also an alterantive implementation as an executable binary that runs in its own process. You can configure the query engine type by providing the `engineType` property to the Prisma Client `generator`:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider   = "prisma-client-js"
  engineType = ["binary"]
}
```

You can also use environment variables [`PRISMA_CLIENT_ENGINE_TYPE`](TODO)

TODO Format nicer somehow as a component
Notes:

- Until Prisma 3.x the default and only engine type was `binary`. So there was no way to configure the engine type to be used by Prisma Client and Prisma CLI.
- From release [2.20.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/2.20.0) to 3.x the `library` engine type was availabe in preview by [activating the preview feature flag](../concepts/components/preview-features/client-preview-features#enabling-a-prisma-client-preview-feature) "`nApi`" or using the `PRISMA_FORCE_NAPI=true` environment variable.

### Defining the query engine type for Prisma CLI

Prisma CLI also currently uses its own copy of the query engine for some functionality. If you need to change the engine type of that, you can define the environment varibale value [`PRISMA_CLI_QUERY_ENGINE_TYPE=binary`](TODO) to make it use a binary query engine as well.
