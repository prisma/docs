<TopBlock>

The Prisma CLI is available as an [npm package](). We **recommend that you install the Prisma CLI locally** in your project's `package.json` to avoid version conflicts.

See [Prisma CLI command reference](../../../reference/api-reference/command-reference) <span class="api"></span> for a complete list of commands.

## Local installation (recommended)

The Prisma CLI is typically installed as a **development dependency**, that's why the `--save-dev` (npm) and `--dev` (Yarn) options are used in the commands below.

### npm

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

This should add `prisma` to the `devDependencies` in your `package.json`. You can then invoke the locally installed CLI with the **`prisma`** command prefixed with [`npx`](https://github.com/npm/npx#readme):

```
npx prisma
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
npx prisma generate
```

### Yarn (1.19.2+)

Install with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```
yarn add prisma --dev
```

This should add `prisma` to the `devDependencies` in your `package.json`. You can then invoke the locally installed CLI with the **`prisma`** command prefixed with `yarn`:

```
yarn prisma
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
yarn prisma generate
```

<Admonition type="warning">

We recommend that you keep **both** the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` packages in sync to avoid any unexpected errors or behaviors.

</Admonition>

## Global installation (not recommended)

While it is recommended to [locally install](#local-installation-recommended) the Prisma CLI, you can also install it globally on your machine.

> **Warning**: If you have several Prisma projects on your machine, a global installation can lead to version conflicts between these projects.

### npm

Install with npm:

```
npm install -g prisma
```

You can then invoke the globally installed CLI with the **`prisma`** command like so:

```
prisma
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
prisma generate
```

### Yarn

Install with Yarn:

```
yarn global add prisma
```

You can then invoke the globally installed CLI with the **`prisma`** command like so:

```
prisma
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
prisma generate
```

## Using a HTTP proxy for the CLI

Prisma CLI supports [custom HTTP proxies](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/506). This is particularly relevant when being behind a corporate firewall.

To activate the proxy, provide the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and/or `HTTPS_PROXY`. The behavior is very similar to how the [`npm` CLI handles this](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#https-proxy).

The following environment variables can be provided:

- [`HTTP_PROXY`](../../../reference/api-reference/environment-variables-reference/#http_proxy) <span class="api"></span> or `http_proxy`: Proxy URL for http traffic, for example `http://localhost:8080`
- [`HTTPS_PROXY`](../../../reference/api-reference/environment-variables-reference/#https_proxy) <span class="api"></span> or `https_proxy`: Proxy URL for https traffic, for example `https://localhost:8080`

> To get a local proxy, you can also use the [`proxy`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy) module.
