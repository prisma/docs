## Enabling a Prisma Client preview feature

To enable a Prisma Client Preview feature:

1. Add the Preview feature flag to the `generator` block:

   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider        = "prisma-client-js"
     previewFeatures = ["orderByRelations"]
   }
   ```

2. Re-generate the client:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. If you are using Visual Studio Code and the Preview feature is not available in your `.ts` file after generating the client, run the **TypeScript: Restart TS server** command.
