When we release a new Prisma Client or Prisma schema feature, it often starts in preview so that you can test it and submit your feedback. After we improve the feature with your feedback and are satisfied with the internal test results, we promote the feature to general availability.

For more information, see [ORM releases and maturity levels](/about/prisma/releases).

To enable a preview feature, [add the feature flag to the `generator` block](#enabling-a-prisma-client-preview-feature) in your `schema.prisma` file. [Share your feedback on all preview features on GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3108).

## Enabling a Prisma Client preview feature

To enable a Prisma Client preview feature:

1. Add the preview feature flag to the `generator` block:

   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider        = "prisma-client-js"
     previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch"]
   }
   ```

2. Re-generate Prisma Client:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. If you are using Visual Studio Code and the preview feature is not available in your `.ts` file after generating Prisma Client, run the **TypeScript: Restart TS server** command.
