The Microsoft SQL Connector is available as a Preview feature in [2.10.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.10.0).

## Enable SQL Server Preview feature

To enable the Microsoft SQL Server Preview feature:

1. Update the `client` and `datasource` blocks in your schema as shown:

   ```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma highlight=3,7;normal
   generator client {
     provider        = "prisma-client-js"
     previewFeatures = ["microsoftSqlServer"]
   }
   
   datasource db {
     provider = "sqlserver"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

1. Generate Prisma Client:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma generate
   ```

Alternatively, follow the [Microsoft SQL Server tutorial](sql-server-start-from-scratch-typescript).

## Type mapping between Microsoft SQL Server to Prisma schema

For type mappings organized by Prisma type, refer to the [Prisma schema reference](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#model-field-scalar-types) documentation.

## Supported versions

See [Supported databases](../../../../reference/database-reference/supported-databases#preview).

## Limitations and known issues

### Prisma Migrate caveats

Prisma Migrate is supported in [2.13.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.13.0) and later with the following caveats:

#### Database schema names

SQL Server does not have an equivalent to the PostgreSQL `SET search_path` command familiar from PostgreSQL. This means that when you create migrations, you must define the same schema name in the connection URL that is used by the production database. For most of the users this is `dbo` (the default value). However, if the production database uses another schema name, all the migration SQL must be either edited by hand to reflect the production _or_ the connection URL must be changed before creating migrations (for example: `schema=name`).

#### Cascading rules

SQL Server follows the same cascading rules as other database providers - for most relations (with certain restrictions), Prisma runs `ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE` (delete all children from a parent automatically).

However, SQL Server cascading has certain restrictions that do not allow us to create certain kinds of relations. Consider the following schema:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Album {
  id        Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  artist_id Int
  artist    Artist @relation(fields: [artist_id], references: [id])
}

model Artist {
  id     Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  albums Album[]
}
```

Next, add a favorite album to every artist:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;normal
model Artist {
  id             Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  album_id       Int
  favorite_album Album   @relation(fields: [album_id], references: [id], name: "FK_fav_album")
  albums         Album[]
}
```

This results in an error:

```
Introducing FOREIGN KEY constraint `FK__Artist__album_id__2D3D91F9` on table `Artist` may cause cycles or multiple cascade paths. Specify `ON DELETE NO ACTION` or `ON UPDATE NO ACTION`, or modify other FOREIGN KEY constraints.
```

SQL Server does not allow cyclic cascading, and in our example our relations go from `Album` to `Artist` and through another relation from `Artist` back to `Album`. In [Microsoft's words](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/321843/error-message-1785-occurs-when-you-create-a-foreign-key-constraint-tha), the cause for this is:

```
You receive this error message because in SQL Server, a table cannot appear more than one time in a list of all the cascading referential actions that are started by either a DELETE or an UPDATE statement. For example, the tree of cascading referential actions must only have one path to a particular table on the cascading referential actions tree.
```

Another, simpler example that is not possible in the first version of Prisma Migrate for SQL Server is a self-reference:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Artist {
  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  muse_id Int?
  muse    Artist @relation(fields: [muse_id], references: [id])
}
```

If you want to use relations as described here, you must:

- Create the migration using the `--create-only` flag
- Modify the cascading rules manually before writing to the database

#### Destructive changes

Certain migrations will cause more changes than you might expect. For example:

- Adding or removing `autoincrement()`. This cannot be achieved by modifying the column, but requires recreating the table (including all constraints, indices, and foreign keys) and moving all data between the tables.
- Additionally, it is not possible to delete all the columns from a table (possible with PostgreSQL or MySQL). If a migration needs to recreate all table columns, it will also re-create the table.

#### Shared default values are not supported

In some cases, user might want to define default values as shared objects:

```sql file=default_objects.sql
CREATE DEFAULT catcat AS 'musti';

CREATE TABLE cats (
    id INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name NVARCHAR(1000)
);

sp_bindefault 'catcat', 'dbo.cats.name';
```

Using the stored procedure `sp_bindefault`, the default value `catcat` can be used in more than one table. The way Prisma manages default values is per table:

```sql file=default_per_table.sql
CREATE TABLE cats (
    id INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name NVARCHAR(1000) CONSTRAINT DF_cat_name DEFAULT 'musti'
);
```

The last example, when introspected, leads to the following model:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model cats {
  id   Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String? @default("musti")
}
```

And the first doesn't get the default value introspected:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model cats {
  id   Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String?
}
```

If using Prisma Migrate together with shared default objects, changes to them must be done manually to the SQL.

### Data model limitations

#### Cannot use column with `UNIQUE` constraint and filtered index as foreign key

Microsoft SQL Server [only allows one `NULL` value in a column that has a `UNIQUE` constraint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/unique-constraints-and-check-constraints?view=sql-server-ver15#Unique). For example:

- A table of users has a column named `license_number`
- The `license_number` field has a `UNIQUE` constraint
- The `license_number` field only allows **one** `NULL` value

The standard way to get around this issue is to create a filtered unique index that excludes `NULL` values. This allows you to insert multiple `NULL` values. If you do not create an index in the database, you will get an error if you try to insert more than one `null` value into a column with Prisma Client.

_However_, creating an index makes it impossible to use `license_number` as a foreign key in the database (or a relation scalar field in corresponding Prisma Schema)
