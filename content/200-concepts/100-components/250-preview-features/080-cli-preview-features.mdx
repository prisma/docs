## <inlinecode> prisma migrate diff </inlinecode>

This command examines two database schema sources to create a migration taking the first to the state of the second.
The supported types of sources are:

- live databases
- migration histories
- Prisma data models
- an empty schema

The format of the command is:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate diff --preview-feature --from-empty --to-url $PROD_DATABASE
```

## <inlinecode> prisma db execute </inlinecode>

This command applies a SQL script to the database without interacting with the Prisma migrations table. The script can be passed via a file path or stdin.

The format of the command is:

```terminal
npx prisma db execute --preview-feature --url $PROD_DATABASE --file script.sql
```
