The following examples demonstrate how to import and initialize your [generated client](generating-prisma-client):

With TypeScript:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

With JavaScript:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

If you [specified a custom `output`](generating-prisma-client#using-a-custom-output-path), you must import your `PrismaClient` from a custom location.

In the context of an application:

* Instantiate `PrismaClient` _once_
* [`PrismaClient`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#prismaclient) <span class="api"></span>) accepts constructor parameters

</TopBlock>

## Instantiate <inlinecode>PrismaClient</inlinecode> once

When you instantiate `PrismaClient`:

* Engines create connection
* etc etc

Error that occurs when you have to many connections:

```
Error in connector: Error querying the database: db error: FATAL: sorry, too many clients already
    at PrismaClientFetcher.request
```

Create a file named 'prismaclient.ts':

```ts
```

Singleton:

* Instantiate `PrismaClient` once
* Return same instance each time

### `PrismaClient` in a serverless app

## Constructor parameters

* Logging
* Error formatting
* Global behavior of `findUnique` and `findOne`
