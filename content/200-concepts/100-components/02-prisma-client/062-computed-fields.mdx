Computed fields allow you to derive a new field based on existing data. A common example is when you compute a full name from a first and last name. In your database, you may only store the first and last name, but you can define a function the computes a full name by combining the first and last name. This field is read-only and stored in your application's memory, not in your database.

## Deriving a Full Name from a First and Last Name

Prisma Client does not yet natively support computed fields, but with a bit of TypeScript magic, you can define a function that accepts a generic as an input then extend that generic to ensure it conforms to a specific structure. Finally, you can return that generic with additional computed fields. Let's see how that might look:

<tab>

```tsx
// Define a type that needs a first and last name
type FirstLastName = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

// Extend the T generic with the fullName attribute
type WithFullName<T> = T & {
  fullName: string
}

// Take objects that satisfy FirstLastName and computes a full name
function computeFullName<User extends FirstLastName>(
  user: User
): WithFullName<User> {
  return {
    ...user,
    fullName: user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName,
  }
}

async function main() {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: 1 })
  const userWithFullName = computeFullName(user)
}
```

</tab>

<tab>

```js
function computeFullName(user) {
  return {
    ...user,
    fullName: user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName,
  }
}

async function main() {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: 1 })
  const userWithFullName = computeFullName(user)
}
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

In the TypeScript example above, a `User` generic has been defined that extends the `FirstLastName` type. This means that whatever you pass into `computeFullName` must contain `firstName` and `lastName` keys.

A `WithFullName<User>` return type has also been defined, which takes whatever `User` is and tacks on a `fullName` string attribute.

With this function, any object that contains `firstName` and `lastName` keys can compute a `fullName`. Pretty neat, right?

## Going Further

- Learn how you can move the `computeFullName` function into [a custom model](/concepts/components/prisma-client/custom-models).
- There's an [outstanding feature request](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3394) to add native support to Prisma Client. If you'd like to see that happen, make sure to upvote that issue and share your use case!
