<TopBlock>

The following example uses middleware to perform a **soft delete**, which means that a record is **marked as deleted** by changing a field like `deleted` to `true` rather than actually being removed from the database. Reasons to use a soft delete include:

- Regulatory requirements that mean you have to keep data for a certain amount of time
- 'Trash' / 'bin' functionality that allows users to restore content that was deleted

This example uses the following schema - note the `deleted` field on the `Post` model:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id        Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name      String?
  email     String  @unique
  posts     Post[]
  followers User[]  @relation("UserToUser")
  User      User?   @relation("UserToUser", fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId    Int?
}

model Post {
  id      Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title   String
  content String?
  User    User?   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId  Int?
  tags    Tag[]
  views   Int     @default(0)
|  deleted Boolean @default(false)
}

model Category {
  id             Int        @default(autoincrement()) @id
  parentCategory Category?  @relation("CategoryToCategory", fields: [categoryId], references: [id])
  Category       Category[] @relation("CategoryToCategory")
  categoryId     Int?
}

model Tag {
  tagName String @id // Must be unique
  posts   Post[]
}

```

</TopBlock>

## Step 1: Store status of record

Add a field named `deleted` to the `Post` model. You can choose between two field types depending on your requirements:

- `Boolean` with a default value of `false`:

  ```prisma
  model Post {
    id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
    ...
  |  deleted   Boolean @default(false)
  }
  ```

- Create a nullable `DateTime` field so that you know exactly _when_ a record was marked as deleted - `NULL` indicates that a record has not been deleted. In some cases, storing when a record was removed may be a regulatory requirement:

  ```prisma
  model Post {
    id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
    ...
  |  deleted   DateTime?
  }
  ```

> **Note**: Using two separate fields (`isDeleted` and `deletedDate`) may result in these two fields becoming out of sync - for example, a record may be marked as deleted but have no associated date.)

This example uses a `Boolean` field type for simplicity.

## Step 2: Soft delete middleware

Add a middleware that performs the following tasks:

- Intercepts `delete` and `deleteMany` queries for the `Post` model
- Changes the `params.action` to `update` and `updateMany` respectively
- Introduces a `data` argument and sets `{ deleted: true }`, preserving other filter arguments if they exist

Run the following example to test the soft delete middleware:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient({})

async function main() {
  /***********************************/
  /* SOFT DELETE MIDDLEWARE */
  /***********************************/

  prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
    // Check incoming query type
    if (params.model == 'Post') {
      if (params.action == 'delete') {
        // Delete queries
        // Change action to an update
        params.action = 'update'
        params.args['data'] = { deleted: true }
      }
      if (params.action == 'deleteMany') {
        // Delete many queries
        params.action = 'updateMany'
        if (params.args.data != undefined) {
          params.args.data['deleted'] = true
        } else {
          params.args['data'] = { deleted: true }
        }
      }
    }
    return next(params)
  })

  /* TEST */

  const titles = [
    { title: 'How to create soft delete middleware' },
    { title: 'How to install Prisma' },
    { title: 'How to update a record' },
  ]

  console.log('\u001b[1;34mSTARTING SOFT DELETE TEST \u001b[0m')
  console.log('\u001b[1;34m#################################### \u001b[0m')

  let i = 0
  let posts = new Array()

  // Create 3 new posts with a randomly assigned title each time
  for (i == 0; i < 3; i++) {
    const createPostOperation = prisma.post.create({
      data: titles[Math.floor(Math.random() * titles.length)],
    })
    posts.push(createPostOperation)
  }

  var postsCreated = await prisma.$transaction(posts)

  console.log(
    'Posts created with IDs: ' + '\u001b[1;32m' + postsCreated.map(x => x.id) + '\u001b[0m'
  )

  // Delete the first post from the array
  const deletePost = await prisma.post.delete({
    where: {
      id: postsCreated[0].id, // Random ID
    },
  })

  // Delete the 2nd two posts
  const deleteManyPosts = await prisma.post.deleteMany({
    where: {
      id: {
        in: [postsCreated[1].id, postsCreated[2].id],

    },
  })

  const getPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
    where: {
      id: {
        in: postsCreated.map(x => x.id),
      },
    },
  })

  console.log()

  console.log('Deleted post with ID: ' + '\u001b[1;32m' + deletePost.id + '\u001b[0m')

        : '\u001b[1;31m' + 'No!' + '\u001b[0m')
  )
  console.log()
  console.log('\u001b[1;34m#################################### \u001b[0m')

    },
  })
  console.log('Number of SOFT deleted posts: ' + '\u001b[1;32m' + r.length + '\u001b[0m')
}

main()
```

The example outputs the following:

```no-lines

> **Tip**: Comment out the middleware to see the message change.

âœ” Pros of this approach to soft delete include:

- Soft delete happens at data access level, which means that you cannot delete records unless you use raw SQL

âœ˜ Cons of this approach to soft delete include:

- Content can still be read and updated unless you explicitly you filter by `where: { deleted: false }` - in a large project with a lot of queries, there is a risk that soft deleted content will still be displayed
- You can still use raw SQL to delete records

  > **Tip**: You can create rules or triggers ([MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/trigger-syntax.html) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/rules-update.html)) at a database level to prevent records from being deleted.

## Step 3: Optionally prevent read/update of soft deleted records

In step 2, we implemented middleware that prevents `Post` records from being deleted. However, you can still read and update deleted records. This steps explores two ways that you can prevent the reading and updating of deleted records.

> **Note**: These options are just ideas with pros and cons, you may choose to do something entirely different.

### Option 1: Implement filters in your own application code

In this option:

- Prisma middleware is responsible for preventing records from being deleted
- Your own application code (which could be a GraphQL API, a REST API, a module) is responsible for filtering out deleted posts where necessary (`{ where: { deleted: false }}`) when reading and updating data - for example, the `getPost` GraphQL resolver never returns a deleted post

âœ” Pros of this approach to soft delete include:

- No change to Prisma's create/update queries - you can easily request deleted records if you need them
- Modifying queries in middleware can have some unintended consequences, such as changing query return types (see option 2)

âœ˜ Cons of this approach to soft delete include:

- Logic relating to soft delete maintained in two different places
- If your API surface is very large and maintained by multiple contributors, it may be difficult to enforce certain business rules (for example, never allow deleted records to be updated)

### Option 2: Use middleware to determine the behavior of read/update queries for deleted records

Option two uses Prisma middleware to prevent soft deleted records from being returned. The following table describes how the middleware affects each query:

| **Query**    | **Middleware logic**                                                                                                                                                                    | **Changes to return type**       |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| `findUnique` | ðŸ”§ Change query to `findFirst` (because you cannot apply `deleted: false` filters to `findUnique`) <br /> ðŸ”§ Add `where: { deleted: false }` filter to exclude soft deleted posts       | No change                        |
| `findMany`   | ðŸ”§ Add `where: { deleted: false }` filter to exclude soft deleted posts by default <br />ðŸ”§ Allow developers to **explicitly request** soft deleted posts by specifying `deleted: true` | No change                        |
| `update`     | ðŸ”§ Change query to `updateMany` (because you cannot apply `deleted: false` filters to `update`) <br /> ðŸ”§ Add `where: { deleted: false }` filter to exclude soft deleted posts          | `{ count: n }` instead of `Post` |
| `updateMany` | ðŸ”§ Add `where: { deleted: false }` filter to exclude soft deleted posts                                                                                                                 | No change                        |

- **Why are you making it possible to use `findMany` with a `{ where: { deleted: true } }` filter, but not `updateMany`?**<br />
  This particular example was written to support the scenario where a user can _restore_ their deleted blog post (which requires a list of soft deleted posts) - but the should not be able to edit a deleted post.
- **Can I still `connect` or `connectOrCreate` a deleted post?**<br />
  In this example - yes. The middleware does not prevent you from connecting an existing, soft deleted post to a user.

Run the following sample to see how middleware affects each query:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient({})

async function main() {
  /***********************************/
  /* SOFT DELETE MIDDLEWARE */
  /***********************************/

  prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
    if (params.model == 'Post') {
      if (params.action == 'findUnique') {
        // Change to findFirst - you cannot filter
        // by anything except ID / unique with findUnique
        params.action = 'findFirst'
        // Add 'deleted' filter
        // ID filter maintained
        params.args.where['deleted'] = false
      }
      if (params.action == 'findMany') {
        // Find many queries
        if (params.args.where != undefined) {
          if (params.args.where.deleted == undefined) {
            // Exclude deleted records if they have not been expicitly requested
            params.args.where['deleted'] = false
          }
        } else {
          params.args['where'] = { deleted: false }
        }
      }
    }
    return next(params)
  })

  prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
    if (params.model == 'Post') {
      if (params.action == 'update') {
        // Change to updateMany - you cannot filter
        // by anything except ID / unique with findUnique
        params.action = "updateMany";
        // Add 'deleted' filter
        // ID filter maintained
        params.args.where['deleted'] = false
      }
      if (params.action == 'updateMany') {
        if (params.args.where != undefined) {
          params.args.where['deleted'] = false
        } else {
          params.args['where'] = { deleted: false }
        }
      }
    }
    return next(params)
  })

  prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
    // Check incoming query type
    if (params.model == 'Post') {
      if (params.action == 'delete') {
        // Delete queries
        // Change action to an update
        params.action = 'update'
        params.args['data'] = { deleted: true }
      }
      if (params.action == 'deleteMany') {
        // Delete many queries
        params.action = 'updateMany'
        if (params.args.data != undefined) {
          params.args.data['deleted'] = true
        } else {
          params.args['data'] = { deleted: true }
        }
      }
    }
    return next(params)
  })

âœ” Pros of this approach:

- A developer can make a conscious choice to include deleted records in `findMany`
- You cannot accidentally read or update a deleted record

âœ– Cons of this approach:

- Not obvious from API that you aren't getting all records and that `{ where: { deleted: false } }` is part of the default query
- Return type `update` affected because middleware changes the query to `updateMany`

## FAQ

### Can I add a global <inlinecode>includeDeleted</inlinecode> to the <inlinecode>Post</inlinecode> model?

You may be tempted to 'hack' your API by adding a `includedDeleted` property to the `Post` model and make the following query possible:

```ts
prisma.post.findMany({ where: { includeDeleted: true } })
```

> **Note**: You would still need to write middleware.

We **âœ˜ do not** recommend this approach as it pollutes the schema with fields that do not represent real data.
