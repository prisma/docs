Prisma Client is an auto-generated and type-safe query builder that's _tailored_ to your data. The easiest way to get started with Prisma Client is by following the **[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)**.

The setup instructions [below](#set-up) provide a high-level overview of the steps needed to set up Prisma Client. If you want to get started using Prisma Client with your own database, follow one of these guides:

## Set up

### 1. Prerequisites

In order to set up Prisma Client, you need a [Prisma schema file](/concepts/components/prisma-schema) with your database connection, the Prisma Client generator, and at least one model:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  provider = "postgresql"
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
}
```

Also make sure to [install the Prisma CLI](/reference/api-reference/command-reference#installation):

```
npm install prisma --save-dev
npx prisma
```

### 2. Installation

Install Prisma Client in your project with the following command:

```
npm install @prisma/client
```

This command also runs the `prisma generate` command, which [generates the Prisma Client into the `node_modules/.prisma/client` directory](working-with-prismaclient/generating-prisma-client#the-prismaclient-npm-package).

### 3. Use Prisma Client to send queries to your database

```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

or

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

Once you have instantiated `PrismaClient`, you can start sending queries in your code:

```ts
// run inside `async` function
const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Alice',
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
  },
})

const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
```

<Admonition type="info">

All Prisma Client methods return an instance of [`PrismaPromise`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#prismapromise-behavior) which only executes when you call `await` or `.then()` or `.catch()`.

</Admonition>

### 4. Evolving your application

Whenever you make changes to your database that are reflected in the Prisma schema, you need to manually re-generate Prisma Client to update the generated code in the [`node_modules/.prisma/client`](working-with-prismaclient/generating-prisma-client#the-prismaclient-npm-package) directory:

```
prisma generate
```
