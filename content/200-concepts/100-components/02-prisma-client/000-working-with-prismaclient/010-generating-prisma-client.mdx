Prisma Client is an auto-generated database client that's tailored to your database schema. By default, Prisma Client is generated into the `node_modules/@prisma/client` folder, but [you can specify a custom location](#using-a-custom-output-path).

To generate and instantiate Prisma Client:

1. Ensure that you have [Prisma CLI installed on your machine](../../prisma-cli/installation).

1. Add the following `generator` definition to your Prisma schema:

   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }
   ```

1. Install the `@prisma/client` npm package:

   ```terminal
   npm install @prisma/client
   ```

1. Generate Prisma Client with the following command:

   ```terminal
   prisma generate
   ```

1. You can now [instantiate the Prisma Client](instantiate-prisma-client) in your code:

    <TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="TypeScript" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="JavaScript" icon="code"/>]}>
    <tab>

    ```ts
    import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
    const prisma = new PrismaClient()
    // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
    ```

    </tab>

    <tab>

    ```js
    const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')
    const prisma = new PrismaClient()
    // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
    ```

    </tab>

    </TabbedContent>

> **Important**: You need to re-run the `prisma generate` command after every change that's made to your Prisma schema to update the generated Prisma Client code.

Here is a graphical illustration of the typical workflow for the Prisma Client generation:

Note also that `prisma generate` is _automatically_ invoked when you're installing the `@prisma/client` npm package. So, when you're initially setting up Prisma Client, you can typically save the third step from the list above.

## The `@prisma/client` npm package

The `@prisma/client` npm package consists of two key parts:

- The `@prisma/client` module itself, which only changes when you re-install the package
- The `.prisma/client` folder, which is the [default location](#using-a-custom-output-path) for the unique Prisma client generated from your schema

`@prisma/client/index.d.ts` exports `.prisma/client`:

```ts
export * from '.prisma/client'
```

This means that you still import `@prisma/client` in your own `.ts` files:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
```

The Prisma client is generated from your Prisma schema and is unique to your project. Each time you change the schema (for example, by performing a [schema migration](../../prisma-migrate)) and run `prisma generate`, the client code changes:

![The .prisma and @prisma folders](prisma-client-node-module.png)

The `.prisma` folder is unaffected by [pruning](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/prune.html) in Node.js package managers.

## The location of Prisma Client

If you do not specify an a custom `output` in the `generator` block, Prisma Client is generated into the `./node_modules/.prisma/client` folder by default. There are [some advantages to maintaining the default location](#why-is-prisma-client-generated-into-node_modulesprismaclient-by-default).

### Using a custom `output` path

You can also specify a custom `output` path on the `generator` configuration, for example:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./src/generated/client"
}
```

After running `prisma generate` for that schema file, the Prisma Client package will be located in:

```
./src/generated/client
```

To import the `PrismaClient` from a custom location:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '../prisma/src/generated/client'
```

### Why is Prisma Client generated into `node_modules/.prisma/client` by default?

#### Importing Prisma Client

By generating Prisma Client into `node_modules/.prisma/client` and exporting it from `node_modules/@prisma/client`, you can import it and instantiate the client in your code as follows:

```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

or

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

#### Keeping the query engine binary out of version control by default

Prisma Client is based on a _query engine_ that's running as a sidecar process alongside your application. This query engine _binary_ is downloaded when `prisma generate` is invoked and stored in the `output` path.

By generating Prisma Client into `node_modules`, the query engine is kept out of version control by default (since `node_modules` is typically ignored for version control). If it was not generated into `node_modules`, then you would need to explicitly ignore it, e.g. for Git you'd need to add the `output` path to your `.gitignore` file.

## Generating Prisma Client in the `postinstall` hook of `@prisma/client`

The `@prisma/client` package defines its own `postinstall` hook that's being executed whenever the package is being installed. This hook invokes the `prisma generate` command which in turn generates the Prisma Client code into the default location `node_modules/.prisma/client`. Notice that this requires the `prisma` to be available, either as local dependency or as a global installation (it is recommended to always install the `prisma` package as a development dependency, using `npm install prisma --save-dev`, to avoid versioning conflicts though).
