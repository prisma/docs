The following example demonstrates how to import and instantiate your [generated client](generating-prisma-client) from the [default path](generating-prisma-client#using-a-custom-output-path):

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="TypeScript" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="Javascript" icon="code"/>]}>

<tab>

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

</tab>

<tab>

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

> **Tip**: You can further customize `PrismaClient` with [constructor parameters](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#prismaclient) <span class="api"></span> - for example, set [logging levels](logging) or customize [error formatting](error-formatting).

## The the number of `PrismaClient` instances matters

Each instance of `PrismaClient` manages a [database connection pool](connection-pool), which means that a large number of clients can **exhaust the database connection limit**:

1. Each client creates its own instance of the [query engine](../query-engine).
2. Each query engine creates a [connection pool](connection-pool) with a default pool size of `num_physical_cpus * 2 + 1`. 
3. Too many connections may start to **slow down your database** and eventually lead to the following error:

    ```
    Error in connector: Error querying the database: db error: FATAL: sorry, too many clients already
        at PrismaClientFetcher.request
    ```

How to address this challenge depends on whether you are using Prisma in a [long-running application](#prismaclient-in-long-running-applications) or in a [serverless environment](#prismaclient-in-serverless-environments).
