The following example demonstrates how to import and instantiate your [generated client](generating-prisma-client) from the [default path](generating-prisma-client#using-a-custom-output-path):

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="TypeScript" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="Javascript" icon="code"/>]}>

<tab>

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

</tab>

<tab>

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

[`PrismaClient` accepts parameters](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#prismaclient) <span class="api"></span> that determine:

* [Logging levels](logging)
* [Error formatting](error-formatting)
* [The global behavior of `findUnique` and `findFirst` queries](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#rejectonnotfound) <span class="api"></span>

</TopBlock>

## Use a single shared instance of <inlinecode>PrismaClient</inlinecode>

In long-running applications, we recommend that you:

* ✔ Create **one** instance of `PrismaClient` and re-use it across your application
* ✔ Assign `PrismaClient` to a global variable _in dev environments only_ to [prevent hot reloading from creating new instances](#prevent-hot-reloading-from-creating-new-instances-of-prismaclient)

> **Note**: You [do not need to explicitly `$disconnect()`](connection-management#calling-disconnect-explicitly) in the context of a long-running application, such as a GraphQL server.

Multiple instances of `PrismaClient` results in multiple instances of the [query engine](../query-engine). Each query engine creates a [connection pool](connection-management#connection-pool) with a default pool size of `num_physical_cpus * 2 + 1`. Too many connections may start to slow down your database and eventually lead to the following error:

```
Error in connector: Error querying the database: db error: FATAL: sorry, too many clients already
    at PrismaClientFetcher.request
```

To re-use a single instance, create a module that exports a `PrismaClient` object:

```ts file=client.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"

let prisma = new PrismaClient() 

export default prisma
```

The object is [cached](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_caching) the first time the module is imported. Subsequent requests return the cached object rather than creating a new `PrismaClient`:

```ts file=app.ts
import prisma from './client'

async function main() {
  const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany();
}

main();
```

### Prevent hot reloading from creating new instances of `PrismaClient`

Frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) support hot reloading of changed files, which enables you to see changes to your application without restarting. However, if the framework refreshes the module responsible for exporting `PrismaClient`, this can result in **additional, unwanted instances of `PrismaClient` in a development environment**.

As a workaround, you can store `PrismaClient` as a global variable in development environments only, as global variables are not reloaded:

```ts file=client.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"

declare global {
    namespace NodeJS {
        interface Global {
            prisma: PrismaClient;
        }
    }
}

let prisma: PrismaClient;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  prisma = new PrismaClient()
} else {
  if (!global.prisma) {
    global.prisma = new PrismaClient()
  }

  prisma = global.prisma
}

export default prisma
```

The way that you import and use the client does not change:

```ts file=app.ts
import prisma from './client'

async function main() {
    const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany();
}

main();
```
