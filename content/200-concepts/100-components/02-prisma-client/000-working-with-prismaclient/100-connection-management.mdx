Prisma Client connects and disconnects from your data sources using the following two methods:

- [`$connect()`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#connect-1) <span class="api"></span>
- [`$disconnect()`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#disconnect-1) <span class="api"></span>

</TopBlock>

## Calling `$connect()` explicitly

It is not necessary to call `prisma.$connect()` thanks to the _lazy connect_ behavior: The `PrismaClient` instance connects lazily when the first request is made to the API (`$connect()` is called for you under the hood).

If you need the first request to respond instantly and cannot wait for a lazy connection to be established, you can explicitly call `prisma.$connect()` to establish a connection to the data source:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// run inside `async` function
await prisma.$connect()
```

## Calling `$disconnect()` explicitly

When you call `$disconnect()`, Prisma:

1. Runs the [`beforeExit` hook](#exit-hooks)
2. Ends child processes
3. Ends the Node.js process _if there are no other active listeners_ (for example, `SIGINT`)

In a long-running application such as a GraphQL API, which constantly serves requests, it does not make sense to `$disconnect()` after each request - it takes time to establish a connection, and doing so as part of each request will slow down your application.

> **Tip**: To avoid too _many_ connections, we recommend that you [use a single instance of `PrismaClient` across your application](instantiate-prisma-client).

One scenario where you should call `$disconnect()` explicitly is where a script:

1. Runs infrequently (for example, a scheduled job to send emails each night), which means it does not benefit from a long-running connection to the database _and_
2. Exists in the context of a long-running application, such as a background service. If the application never shuts down, Prisma Client never disconnects.

The following script creates a new instance of `PrismaClient`, performs a task, and then disconnects:

```ts highlight=18;normal
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
const emailService = new EmailService();

async function main() {

    const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany();
    const emails = allUsers.map(x => x.email)

    await emailService.send(emails, "Hello!");
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

## Connection management in serverless environments

In serverless environments, such as AWS Lambda, there are nuances that make it sensible to reuse database connections and _not_ call `$disconnect()`. Refer to the [deployment docs](../deployment) for more examples.

## Connection pool

Once `$connect` was called, the query engine immediately creates a connection pool for the amount of connections that were specified as the`connection_limit` parameter on your database connection URL.

For example, with the following `datasource` configuration in your [Prisma schema](../../prisma-schema) the connection pool will have exactly five connections:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?connection_limit=5"
}
```

If the `connection_limit` argument is omitted, the default number of connections is calculated according to this formula: `num_physical_cpus * 2 + 1` where `num_physical_cpus` represents the number of physical CPUs on your machine.

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb"
}
```

If your machine has four physical CPUs, your connection pool will contain nine connections (`4 * 2 + 1 = 9`).

## Exit hooks

The `beforeExit` hook runs _before_ Prisma ends its child processes and allows you to issue queries beore the client disconnects - for example, as part of a graceful shutdown of a service:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

prisma.$on('beforeExit', async () => {
    // PrismaClient still available
    await prisma.message.create({
      data: {
        message: "Shutting down server";
      }
    })
})
```
