<TopBlock>

`PrismaClient` connects and disconnects from your data source using the following two methods:

- [`$connect()`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#connect-1) <span class="api"></span>
- [`$disconnect()`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#disconnect-1) <span class="api"></span>

In most cases, you **do not need to explicitly call these methods**. `PrismaClient` automatically connects when you run your first query, creates a [connection pool](connection-pool), and disconnects when the Node.js process ends.

See the [connection management guide](../../../../guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management) <span class="guide"></span> for information about managing connections for different deployment paradigms (long-running processes and serverless functions).

## <inlinecode>$connect()</inlinecode>

It is not necessary to call [`$connect()`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#connect-1) <span class="api"></span> thanks to the _lazy connect_ behavior: The `PrismaClient` instance connects lazily when the first request is made to the API (`$connect()` is called for you under the hood).

### Calling <inlinecode>$connect()</inlinecode> explicitly

If you need the first request to respond instantly and cannot wait for a lazy connection to be established, you can explicitly call `prisma.$connect()` to establish a connection to the data source:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// run inside `async` function
await prisma.$connect()
```

## <inlinecode>$disconnect()</inlinecode>

When you call [`$disconnect()`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#disconnect-1) <span class="api"></span>, Prisma Client:

1. Runs the [`beforeExit` hook](#exit-hooks)
2. Ends the Query Engine child process and closes all connections

In a long-running application such as a GraphQL API, which constantly serves requests, it does not make sense to `$disconnect()` after each request - it takes time to establish a connection, and doing so as part of each request will slow down your application.

<Tip>

To avoid too _many_ connections in a long-running application, we recommend that you [use a single instance of `PrismaClient` across your application](instantiate-prisma-client).

</Tip>

### Calling <inlinecode>$disconnect()</inlinecode> explicitly

One scenario where you should call `$disconnect()` explicitly is where a script:

1. Runs **infrequently** (for example, a scheduled job to send emails each night), which means it does not benefit from a long-running connection to the database _and_
2. Exists in the context of a **long-running application**, such as a background service. If the application never shuts down, Prisma Client never disconnects.

The following script creates a new instance of `PrismaClient`, performs a task, and then disconnects - which closes the connection pool:

```ts highlight=19;normal
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
const emailService = new EmailService()

async function main() {
  const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany()
  const emails = allUsers.map((x) => x.email)

  await emailService.send(emails, 'Hello!')
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

If the above script runs multiple times in the context of a long-running application _without_ calling `$disconnect()`, a new connection pool is created with each new instance of `PrismaClient`.

## Exit hooks

The `beforeExit` hook runs _before_ Prisma ends its child processes and allows you to issue queries before the client disconnects - for example, as part of a graceful shutdown of a service:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

prisma.$on('beforeExit', async () => {
    // PrismaClient still available
    await prisma.message.create({
      data: {
        message: "Shutting down server";
      }
    })
})
```
