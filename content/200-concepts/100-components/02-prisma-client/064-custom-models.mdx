As your application grows, you may find the need to group related logic together. We suggest either wrapping a model in a class or extending Prisma Client model object.

## Wrap a Prisma Model in a Class

In the example below, you'll see how you can wrap the `user` model in the Prisma Client within a `Users` class.

```tsx
import { PrismaClient, User } from '@prisma/client'

type Signup = {
  email: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

class Users {
  constructor(private readonly prismaUser: PrismaClient['user']) {}

  // Signup a new user
  async signup(data: Signup): Promise<User> {
    // do some custom validation...
    return this.prismaUser.create({ data })
  }
}

async function main() {
  const prisma = new PrismaClient()
  const users = new Users(prisma.user)
  const user = await users.signup({
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    firstName: 'Alice',
    lastName: 'Prisma',
  })
}
```

With this new `Users` class, you can define custom functions like `signup`:

Note that in the example above, you're only exposing a `signup` method from Prisma Client. The Prisma Client is hidden within the `Users` class, so you're no longer be able to call methods like `findMany` and `upsert`.

This approach works well when you have a large application and you want to intentionally limit what your models can do.

## Extending Prisma Client

But what if you don't want to hide existing functionality but still want to group custom functions together? In this case, you can use `Object.assign` to extend Prisma Client without limiting its functionality:

```tsx
import { PrismaClient, User } from '@prisma/client'

type Signup = {
  email: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

function Users(prismaUser: PrismaClient['user']) {
  return Object.assign(prismaUser, {
    /**
     * Signup the first user and create a new team of one. Return the User with
     * a full name and without a password
     */
    async signup(data: Signup): Promise<User> {
      return prismaUser.create({ data })
    },
  })
}

async function main() {
  const prisma = new PrismaClient()
  const users = Users(prisma.user)
  const user = await users.signup({
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    firstName: 'Alice',
    lastName: 'Prisma',
  })
  const numUsers = await users.count()
  console.log(user, numUsers)
}
```

Now you can use your custom `signup` method alongside `count`, `updateMany`, `groupBy` and all of the other wonderful methods that Prisma Client provides. Best of all, it's all type-safe!
