Several type utilities exist within Prisma Client that can assist in the creation of highly type-safe extensions.

## Type Utilities

[Prisma Client type utilities](/concepts/components/prisma-client/advanced-type-safety/) are utilities available within your application and Prisma Client extensions and provide useful ways of constructing safe and extendable types for your extension.

The type utilities available are:

- `Exact<Input, Shape>`: Enforces strict type safety on `Input`. `Exact` makes sure that a generic type `Input` strictly complies with the type that you specify in `Shape`. It [narrows](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html) `Input` down to the most precise types.
- `Args<Type, Operation>`: Retrieves the input arguments for any given model and operation. This is particularly useful for extension authors who want to do the following:
  - Re-use existing types to extend or modify them.
  - Benefit from the same auto-completion experience as on existing operations.
- `Result<Type, Arguments, Operation>`: Takes the input arguments and provides the result for a given model and operation. You would usually use this in conjunction with `Args`. As with `Args`, `Result` helps you to re-use existing types to extend or modify them.
- `Payload<Type, Operation>`: Retrieves the entire structure of the result, as scalars and relations objects for a given model and operation. For example, you can use this to determine which keys are scalars or objects at a type level.

## Example

The following example creates a new operation, `customCall`, based on `findFirst`. It has all of the arguments that `findFirst` has, with an additional property, `customProperty`.

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  model: {
    $allModels: {
      // Define a new operation `customCall`.
      // T corresponds to the current model,
      // A corresponds to the arguments for the operation.
      customCall<T, A>(
        // `this` is the current type (for example
        // it might be `prisma.user` at runtime).
        this: T,
        x: Prisma.Exact<
          A,
          // For `customCall`, use the arguments from model `T` and the
          // operation `findFirst`. Add `customProperty` to the operation.
          Prisma.Args<T, 'findFirst'> & { customProperty: boolean }
        >

        // Get the correct result types for the model of type `T`,
        // and the arguments of type `A` for `findFirst`.
        // `Prisma.Result` computes the result for a given operation
        // such as `select {id: true}` in function `main` below.
        //
      ): Prisma.Result<T, A, 'findFirst'> {
        // Override type safety here, because we cannot
        // predict the result types in advance.
        return {} as any
      },
    },
  },
})

async function main() {
  const test0 = xprisma.link.customCall({
    customProperty: true,
    select: {
      id: true,
    },
  })
}
```
