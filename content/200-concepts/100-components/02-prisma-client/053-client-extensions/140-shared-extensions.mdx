You can share your [Prisma Client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) with other users, either as packages or as modules, and import extensions that other users create into your project.

If you would like to build a shareable extension, we also recommend using the [`prisma-client-extension-starter`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-extension-starter) template.

## Share Prisma Client extensions

When you want to create extensions other users can use, and that are not tailored just for your schema, Prisma provides utilities to allow you to create shareable extensions.

### Define an extension

Use the `Prisma.defineExtension` method to make your extension shareable. You can use it to package the extension to either separate your extensions into a separate file or share it with other users as an npm package.

The benefit of `Prisma.defineExtension` is that it provides strict type checks and auto completion for authors of extension in development and users of shared extensions.

To define an extension:

1. Define the extension as a module using `Prisma.defineExtension`
2. Use one of the methods that begin with the `$all` prefix such as [`$allModels`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/model#add-a-custom-method-to-all-models-in-your-schema) or `$allOperations`

Extensions that contain methods with the `$all` prefix apply to a client instance and not to a named component, e.g. `result` or `query`, of a specific instance.

You do not need to use the `$all` prefix with the [`client`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/client) component, because the `client` component always applies to the client instance.

For example, a generic extension might take the following form:

```ts
export default Prisma.defineExtension({
  name: 'prisma-extension-find-or-create', //Extension name
  model: {
    $allModels: {
      // new method
      findOrCreate(/* args */) {
        /* code for the new method */
      },
    },
  },
})
```

You can use the `$allOperations` method available in `$allModels` to modify all operations all models in a schema:

```ts
export default Prisma.defineExtension({
  query: {
    $allModels: {
      $allOperations({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        /* code for the extension */
        return query(args)
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Use the `$allOperations` method to modify all query methods present in Prisma Client. The `$allOperations` can be used on both model operations and raw queries:

```ts
export default Prisma.defineExtension({
  query: {
    $allOperations({ model, operation, args, query }) {
      /* code for the extension */
      return query(args)
    },
  },
})
```

In the event a raw query is invoked, the `model` argument passed to the callback will be `null`.

The `Prisma` import is available from a different path shown in the snippet below:

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client/scripts/default-index'

export default Prisma.defineExtension({
  name: 'prisma-extension-<extension-name>',
})
```

</details>

You can then share the extension on `npm`. When you choose a package name, we recommend that you use the `prisma-extension-<package-name>` convention, to make it easier to find and install.

### Call a client-level method from your packaged extension

In the following situations, you need to refer to a Prisma Client instance that your extension wraps:

- When you want to use a [client-level method](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods), such as `$queryRaw`, in your packaged extension.
- When you want to chain multiple `$extends` calls in your packaged extension.

However, when someone includes your packaged extension in their project, your code cannot know the details of the Prisma Client instance.

You can refer to this client instance as follows:

```ts
Prisma.defineExtension((client) => {
  // The Prisma Client instance that the extension user applies the extension to
  return client.$extends({
    name: 'prisma-extension-<extension-name>',
  })
})
```

For example:

```ts
export default Prisma.defineExtension((client) => {
  return client.$extends({
    name: 'prisma-extension-find-or-create',
    query: {
      $allModels: {
        async findOrCreate({ args, query, operation }) {
          return (await client.$transaction([query(args)]))[0]
        },
      },
    },
  })
})
```

## Improve the type safety and developer experience of your shared extensions

You can improve the type-safety and developer experience of your shared extensions with the [type utilities on `model` components](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/model#advanced-type-safety-improve-the-type-safety-and-developer-experience-of-your-custom-model-methods).

## Install a packaged extension

In your project, you can install any Prisma Client extension that another user has published to `npm`. To do so, run the following command:

```terminal
npm install prisma-extension-<package-name>
```

For example, if the package name for an available extension is `prisma-extension-find-or-create`, you could install it as follows:

```terminal
npm install prisma-extension-find-or-create
```

To import the `find-or-create` extension from the example above, and wrap your client instance with it, you could use the following code. This example assumes that the extension name is `findOrCreate`.

```ts
import findOrCreate from 'prisma-extension-find-or-create'

const xprisma = prisma.$extends(findOrCreate)
const user = await xprisma.user.findOrCreate({ ... })

xprisma.user.findOrCreate()
```

When you call a method in an extension, use the constant name from your `$extends` statement, not `prisma`. In the above example,`xprisma.user.findOrCreate` works, but `prisma.user.findOrCreate` does not, because the original `prisma` is not modified.
