The Prisma Client supports full-text search for **PostgreSQL** databases in versions 2.30.0 and later, and **MySQL** databases in versions 3.8.0 and later. With full-text search enabled, you can add search functionality to your application by searching for text within a database column.

## Enabling full-text search

The full-text search API is currently a Preview feature. To enable this feature, carry out the following steps:

1. Update the [`previewFeatures`](/concepts/components/preview-features) block in your schema to include the `fullTextSearch` preview feature flag:

   ```prisma file=schema.prisma
   generator client {
     provider        = "prisma-client-js"
     previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch"]
   }
   ```

   For MySQL, you will also need to include the `fullTextIndex` preview feature flag:

   ```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3;add
   generator client {
     provider        = "prisma-client-js"
     previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch, fullTextIndex"]
   }
   ```

2. Generate the Prisma Client:

   ```terminal copy
   npx prisma generate
   ```

After you regenerate your client, a new `search` field will be available on any `String` fields created on your models. For example, the following search will return all posts that contain the word 'cat'.

```ts
// All posts that contain the word 'cat'.
const result = await prisma.posts.findMany({
  where: {
    body: {
      search: 'cat',
    },
  },
})
```

## Querying the database

The `search` field uses the database's native querying capabilities under the hood. This means that the exact [query operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-PARSING-QUERIES) available are also database-specific.

### PostgreSQL

The following examples demonstrate the use of the PostgreSQL 'and' (`&`) and 'or' (`|`) operators:

```ts
// All posts that contain the words 'cat' or 'dog'.
const result = await prisma.posts.findMany({
  where: {
    body: {
      search: 'cat | dog',
    },
  },
})

// All drafts that contain the words 'cat' and 'dog'.
const result = await prisma.posts.findMany({
  where: {
    status: 'Draft',
    body: {
      search: 'cat & dog',
    },
  },
})
```

To get a sense of how the query format works, consider the following text:

**"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"**

Here's how the following queries would match that text:

| Query                                   | Match? | Description                             |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `fox & dog`                             | Yes    | The text contains 'fox' and 'dog'       |
| `dog & fox`                             | Yes    | The text contains 'dog' and 'fox'       |
| `dog & cat`                             | No     | The text contains 'dog' but not 'cat'   |
| `!cat`                                  | Yes    | 'cat' is not in the text                |
| <inlinecode>fox &#124; cat</inlinecode> | Yes    | The text contains 'fox' or 'cat'        |
| <inlinecode>cat &#124; pig</inlinecode> | No     | The text doesn't contain 'cat' or 'pig' |
| `fox <-> dog`                           | Yes    | 'dog' follows 'fox' in the text         |
| `dog <-> fox`                           | No     | 'fox' doesn't follow 'dog' in the text  |

For the full range of supported operations, see the [PostgreSQL full text search documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-textsearch.html).

### MySQL

The following examples demonstrate use of the MySQL 'and' (`+`) and 'not' (`-`) operators:

```ts
// All posts that contain the words 'cat' or 'dog'.
const result = await prisma.posts.findMany({
  where: {
    body: {
      search: 'cat dog',
    },
  },
})

// All posts that contain the words 'cat' and not 'dog'.
const result = await prisma.posts.findMany({
  where: {
    body: {
      search: '+cat -dog',
    },
  },
})

// All drafts that contain the words 'cat' and 'dog'.
const result = await prisma.posts.findMany({
  where: {
    status: 'Draft',
    body: {
      search: '+cat +dog',
    },
  },
})
```

To get a sense of how the query format works, consider the following text:

**"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"**

Here's how the following queries would match that text:

| Query          | Match? | Description                                            |
| :------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `+fox +dog`    | Yes    | The text contains 'fox' and 'dog'                      |
| `+dog +fox`    | Yes    | The text contains 'dog' and 'fox'                      |
| `+dog -cat`    | No     | The text contains 'dog' but not 'cat'                  |
| `-cat`         | Yes    | 'cat' is not in the text                               |
| `fox dog`      | Yes    | The text contains 'fox' or 'cat'                       |
| `-cat -pig`    | No     | The text does not contain 'cat' or 'pig'               |
| `quic*`        | Yes    | The text contains a word starting with 'quic'          |
| `quick fox @2` | Yes    | 'fox' starts within a 2 word distance of 'quick'       |
| `fox dog @2`   | No     | 'dog' does not start within a 2 word distance of 'fox' |
| `"jumps over"` | Yes    | The text contains the whole phrase 'jumps over'        |

MySQL also has `>`, `<` and `~` operators for altering the ranking order of search results. As an example, consider the following two records:

**1. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"**

**2. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy cat"**

| Query             | Result                   | Description                                                                                             |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fox ~cat`        | Return 1. first, then 2. | Return all records containing 'fox', but rank records containing 'cat' lower                            |
| `fox (<cat >dog)` | Return 1. first, then 2. | Return all records containing 'fox', but rank records containing 'cat' lower than rows containing 'dog' |

For the full range of supported operations, see the [MySQL full text search documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-boolean.html).

## Adding indexes

### PostgreSQL

To speed up your full-text queries, you should add an index to your database. Prisma Migrate currently doesn't support adding search indices in PostgreSQL, so this should be added in SQL. For example, the following SQL statement would add an index called `post_body_index` on the `body` column of the `posts` table:

```sql
CREATE INDEX post_body_index ON posts USING GIN (body);
```
To know more about adding indexes using SQL, check the [Unique constraints and indexes (PostgreSQL)](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/general-guides/database-workflows/unique-constraints-and-indexes/postgresql#1-create-a-new-database-and-project-directory) guide.

For further information, see the [PostgreSQL documentation on indexes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/textsearch-tables.html#TEXTSEARCH-TABLES-INDEX).

You can continue using Prisma Migrate as you were before, it will ignore indexes that it doesn't know about.

### MySQL

For MySQL, it is necessary to add indexes to any columns you search using the `@@fulltext` argument in the `schema.prisma` file. To do this, the `"fullTextIndex"` preview feature must be enabled.

In the following example, one full text index is added to the `content` field of the `Blog` model, and another is added to both the `content` and `title` fields together:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch", "fullTextIndex"]
}

model Blog {
  id      Int    @unique
  content String
  title   String

  @@fulltext([content])
  @@fulltext([content, title])
}
```

The first index allows searching the `content` field for occurrences of the word 'cat':

```ts
const result = await prisma.blogs.findMany({
  where: {
    content: {
      search: 'cat',
    },
  },
})
```

The second index allows searching both the `content` and `title` fields for occurrences of the word 'cat' in the `content` and 'food' in the `title`:

```ts
const result = await prisma.blogs.findMany({
  where: {
    content: {
      search: 'cat',
    },
    title: {
      search: 'food',
    },
  },
})
```

However, if you try to search on `title` alone, the search will fail with the error "Cannot find a fulltext index to use for the search" and the message code is `P2030`, because the index requires a search on both fields.
