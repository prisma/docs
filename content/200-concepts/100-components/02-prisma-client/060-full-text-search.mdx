Full-text search is available as a Preview feature in [2.30.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.30.0).

With 2.30.0 the Prisma Client supports a full-text search API for Postgres databases. Once enabled as a Preview feature, you can add search functionality to your application by searching for text within a database column.

## Enable full-text search

The full-text Search API is still in **Preview**. To enable `fullTextSearch`:

1. Update the [`previewFeatures`](../preview-features) block in your schema:

   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider        = "prisma-client-js"
     previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch"]
   }
   ```

2. Generate the Prisma Client:

   ```terminal copy
   npx prisma generate
   ```

After you regenerate your client, a new `search` field will be available on any `String` fields created on your models.

### Example of new <inlinecode>search</inlinecode> field

```ts
// All posts that contain the words cat or dog.
const result = await prisma.posts.findMany({
  where: {
    body: {
      search: 'cat | dog',
    },
  },
})

// All drafts that contain the words cat and dog.
const result = await prisma.posts.findMany({
  where: {
    status: 'Draft',
    body: {
      search: 'cat & dog',
    },
  },
})
```

## Query Format

The `search` field uses the database's native querying capabilities under the hood. This means that the Prisma Client [supports what the database supports](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-textsearch.html).

To get a sense of how the query format works, consider the following text:

**"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"**

Here's how the following queries would match that text:

| Query         | Match? | Description                         |
| :------------ | :----- | :---------------------------------- |
| `fox & dog`   | Yes    | The text contains fox and dog       |
| `dog & fox`   | Yes    | The text contains dog and fox       |
| `dog & cat`   | No     | The text doesn't contain cat        |
| `!cat`        | Yes    | There is not cat in the text        |
| `fox \| cat`  | Yes    | The text contains fox or cat        |
| `cat \| pig`  | No     | The text doesn't contain cat or pig |
| `fox <-> dog` | Yes    | dog follows fox in the text         |
| `dog <-> fox` | No     | dog doesn't follow fox in the text  |

## Adding Indexes

To speed up your full-text queries, you should add an index to your database.
Prisma Migrate currently doesn't support adding search indices, but you can
easily add one yourself.

```sql
CREATE INDEX post_body_index ON posts USING GIN (body);
```

You can continue using Prisma Migrate as you were before, it will ignore indexes
that it doesn't know about.

## Limitations

- The `search` field is only supported in PostgreSQL
- You'll need to manage indexes yourself.
