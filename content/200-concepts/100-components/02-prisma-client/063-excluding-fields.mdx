By default Prisma Client returns all fields from a model. You can use `select` to narrow the result set, but that can be unwieldy if you have a large model and you only want to exclude one or two fields.

Prisma Client doesn't have a native way of excluding fields yet, but it's easy to create a function that you can use to exclude certain fields in a type-safe way.

## Excluding the Password Field

The following is a type-safe `exclude` function returns a user without the `password` field.

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="TypeScript" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="JavaScript" icon="code"/>]}>

<tab>

```tsx
// Exclude keys from user
function exclude<User, Key extends keyof User>(
  user: User,
  ...keys: Key[]
): Omit<User, Key> {
  for (let key of keys) {
    delete user[key]
  }
  return user
}

function main() {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: 1 })
  const userWithoutPassword = exclude(user, 'password')
}
```

</tab>

<tab>

```js
// Exclude keys from user
function exclude(user, ...keys) {
  for (let key of keys) {
    delete user[key]
  }
  return user
}

function main() {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: 1 })
  const userWithoutPassword = exclude(user, 'password')
}
```

</tab>

In the TypeScript example, we've provided two generics: `User` and `Key`. The `Key` generic is defined as the keys of a `User` (e.g. `email`, `password`, `firstName`, etc.).

These generics flow through the logic, returning a `User` that omits the list of `Key`s provided.

## Going Further

- Learn how you can move the `exclude` function into [a custom model](/concepts/components/prisma-client/custom-models).
- There's an [outstanding feature request](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5042) to add exclude support natively to the Prisma Client. If you'd like to see that happen, make sure to upvote that issue and share your use case!
