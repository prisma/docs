A database transaction refers to a sequence of read/write operations that are _guaranteed_ to either succeed or fail as a whole. This section describes the ways in which the Prisma Client API supports transactions.

- For more in-depth examples and use cases, refer to the üìñ [transactions guide](../../../guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide).
- For information about transactions in general and the reasoning behind Prisma's current solutions, see ‚úç [Blog: How Prisma supports transactions](https://www.prisma.io/blog/how-prisma-supports-transactions-x45s1d5l0ww1/).

## Nested writes

A [nested write](relation-queries#nested-writes) lets you perform a single Prisma Client API call with multiple _operations_ that touch multiple [_related_](../prisma-schema/relations) records. For example, creating a _user_ together with a _post_ or updating an _order_ together with an _invoice_. Prisma Client ensures that all operations succeed or fail as a whole.

The following example demonstrates a nested write with `create`:

```ts
// Create a new user with two posts in a
// single transaction
const newUser: User = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: [
        { title: 'Join the Prisma Slack on https://slack.prisma.io' },
        { title: 'Follow @prisma on Twitter' },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

The following example demonstrates a nested write with `update`:

```ts
// Change the author of a post in a single transaction
const updatedPost: Post = await prisma.post.update({
  where: { id: 42 },
  data: {
    author: {
      connect: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    },
  },
})
```

> Refer to the üìñ [transactions guide](../../../guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide#nested-writes) for more examples.

## Batch/bulk operations

The following bulk operations run as transactions:

- `deleteMany`
- `updateMany`
- `createMany`

> Refer to the üìñ [transactions guide](../../../guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide#bulk-operations) for more examples.

## The <inlinecode>$transaction</inlinecode> API

The following query returns all posts that match the provided filter as well as a count of all posts:

```ts
const [posts, totalPosts] = await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.post.findMany({ where: { title: { contains: 'prisma' } } }),
  prisma.post.count(),
])
```

You can also use `$queryRaw` and `$executeRaw` inside a `$transaction`:

```ts
const [userList, updateUser] = await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 'title' FROM User`,
  prisma.$executeRaw`UPDATE User SET name = 'Hello' WHERE id = 2;`,
])
```

Instead of immediately awaiting the result of each operation when it's performed, the operation itself is stored in a variable first which later is submitted to the database via a method called `$transaction`. Prisma Client will ensure that either all three `create`-operations or none of them succeed.

> **Note**: Operations are executed according to the order they are placed in the transaction. Using a query in a transaction does not influence the order of operations in the query itself.

## Transaction isolation level

Transaction isolation level is not currently configurable at a Prisma level and is not explicitly set by Prisma.

- [Default transaction isolation level in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DEFAULT-TRANSACTION-ISOLATION)
- [Default transaction isolation level in SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/set-transaction-isolation-level-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)
- [Default transaction isolation level in MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html)
