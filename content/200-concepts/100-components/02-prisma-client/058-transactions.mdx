A database transaction refers to a sequence of read/write operations that are _guaranteed_ to either succeed or fail as a whole. This section describes the ways in which the Prisma Client API supports transactions.

- For more in-depth examples and use cases, refer to the üìñ [transactions guide](https://www.prisma.io/blog/how-prisma-supports-transactions-x45s1d5l0ww1/).
- For information about transactions in general and the reasoning behind Prisma's current solutions, see ‚úç [Blog: How Prisma supports transactions](https://www.prisma.io/blog/how-prisma-supports-transactions-x45s1d5l0ww1/).

## Nested writes

A [nested write](relation-queries#nested-writes) lets you perform a single Prisma Client API call with multiple _operations_ that touch multiple [_related_](../prisma-schema/relations) records. For example, creating a _user_ together with a _post_ or updating an _order_ together with an _invoice_. Prisma Client ensures that all operations succeed or fail as a whole.

The following example demonstrates a nested write with `create`:

```ts
// Create a new user with two posts in a
// single transaction
const newUser: User = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: [
        { title: 'Join the Prisma Slack on https://slack.prisma.io' },
        { title: 'Follow @prisma on Twitter' },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

The following example demonstrates a nested write with `update`:

```ts
// Change the author of a post in a single transaction
const updatedPost: Post = await prisma.post.update({
  where: { id: 42 },
  data: {
    author: {
      connect: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    },
  },
})
```

## Bulk operations

The following bulk operations run as transactions:

- `deleteMany`
- `updateMany`

> Refer to the üìñ [transactions guide](../../../guides/prisma-guides/prisma-client-transactions-guide#bulk-operations) for more examples.

## The `transaction` API

The following example will execute multiple operations within a transaction:

```ts
const write1 = prisma.user.create()
const write2 = prisma.post.create()
const write3 = prisma.profile.create()

const [result1, result2, result3] = await prisma.$transaction([write1, write2, write3])
```

> **Note**: In 2.10.0 and later, you can use `.$executeRaw()` and `.$queryRaw()` inside a transaction.

Instead of immediately awaiting the result of each operation when it's performed, the operation itself is stored in a variable first which later is submitted to the database via a method called `transaction`. Prisma Client will ensure that either all three `create`-operations or none of them succeed.
