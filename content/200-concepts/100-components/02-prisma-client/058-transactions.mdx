A database transaction refers to a sequence of read/write operations that are _guaranteed_ to either succeed or fail as a whole. This section describes the ways in which the Prisma Client API supports transactions.

- For more in-depth examples and use cases, refer to the 📖 [transactions guide](../../../guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide).
- For information about transactions in general and the reasoning behind Prisma's current solutions, see ✍ [Blog: How Prisma supports transactions](https://www.prisma.io/blog/how-prisma-supports-transactions-x45s1d5l0ww1/).

## Nested writes

A [nested write](relation-queries#nested-writes) lets you perform a single Prisma Client API call with multiple _operations_ that touch multiple [_related_](../prisma-schema/relations) records. For example, creating a _user_ together with a _post_ or updating an _order_ together with an _invoice_. Prisma Client ensures that all operations succeed or fail as a whole.

The following example demonstrates a nested write with `create`:

```ts
// Create a new user with two posts in a
// single transaction
const newUser: User = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: [
        { title: 'Join the Prisma Slack on https://slack.prisma.io' },
        { title: 'Follow @prisma on Twitter' },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

The following example demonstrates a nested write with `update`:

```ts
// Change the author of a post in a single transaction
const updatedPost: Post = await prisma.post.update({
  where: { id: 42 },
  data: {
    author: {
      connect: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    },
  },
})
```

> Refer to the 📖 [transactions guide](../../../guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide#nested-writes) for more examples.

## Batch/bulk operations

The following bulk operations run as transactions:

- `deleteMany`
- `updateMany`
- `createMany`

> Refer to the 📖 [transactions guide](../../../guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide#bulk-operations) for more examples.

## The <inlinecode>$transaction</inlinecode> API

The following query returns all posts that match the provided filter as well as a count of all posts:

```ts
const [posts, totalPosts] = await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.post.findMany({ where: { title: { contains: 'prisma' } } }),
  prisma.post.count(),
])
```

You can also use `$queryRaw` and `$executeRaw` inside a `$transaction`:

```ts
const [userList, updateUser] = await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 'title' FROM User`,
  prisma.$executeRaw`UPDATE User SET name = 'Hello' WHERE id = 2;`,
])
```

Instead of immediately awaiting the result of each operation when it's performed, the operation itself is stored in a variable first which later is submitted to the database via a method called `$transaction`. Prisma Client will ensure that either all three `create`-operations or none of them succeed.

> **Note**: Operations are executed according to the order they are placed in the transaction. Using a query in a transaction does not influence the order of operations in the query itself.

### Interactive Transactions

Sometimes you need more control over what queries execute within a transaction.

Interactive transactions are commonly used when the result of one query depends on another query and you want to run both queries within a single transaction.

To support this use case and more, you can enable interactive transactions by adding `interactiveTransactions` in the generator of your Prisma Schema:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["interactiveTransactions"]
}
```

Then you can pass an async function into [`$transaction`](../../../guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide#transaction-api).

The following is an example of purchasing a movie ticket online. In this example, we really don't want to sell the same ticket twice:

```tsx
import { Ticket } from 'prisma'

const userEmail = 'alice@prisma.io'
const movieName = 'October Sky'

// Start a transaction
const ticket: Ticket = await prisma.$transaction(async (prisma) => {
  // Find an available ticket
  const availableTicket = await prisma.ticket.findFirst({
    where: {
      claimedBy: null,
      movie: {
        name: movieName,
      },
    },
  })

  // Throw an error if no tickets are available
  if (!availableTicket) {
    // This will rollback the transaction
    throw new Error(`Oh no! ${movieName} is all booked.`)
  }

  // Claim the ticket, commit the transaction, and return
  // the result
  return prisma.ticket.update({
    data: {
      claimedBy: userEmail,
    },
    where: {
      id: availableTicket.id,
    },
  })
})
```

In the example above, both the `findFirst` and `update` queries run within a database transaction. When your application reaches the end of the function, the transaction is **committed** to the database.

If your application encounters an error along the way, the async function will throw an exception and automatically **rollback** the transaction.

To catch the exception, you can wrap `$transaction` in a try-catch block:

```js
try {
  await prisma.$transaction(async (prisma) => {
    // Code running in a transaction...
  })
} catch (err) {
  // Handle the rollback...
}
```

Additionally, the transaction API supports a 2nd parameter with the following configuration options:

- `maxWait`: The maximum amount of time the Prisma Client will wait to acquire a transaction from the database. The default is 2 seconds.
- `timeout`: The maximum amount of time the interactive transaction can run before being canceled and rolled back. The default value is 5 seconds.

For example:

```jsx
await prisma.$transaction(
  async (prisma) => {
    // Code running in a transaction...
  },
  {
    maxWait: 5000, // default: 2000
    timeout: 10000, // default: 5000
  }
)
```

<Admonition type="warning">

**Use interactive transactions with caution**. Keeping transactions
open for a long time hurts database performance and can even cause deadlocks.
Try to avoid performing network requests and executing slow queries inside your
transaction functions. We recommend you get in and out as quick as possible!

## Transaction isolation level

Transaction isolation level is not currently configurable at a Prisma level and is not explicitly set by Prisma.

- [Default transaction isolation level in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DEFAULT-TRANSACTION-ISOLATION)
- [Default transaction isolation level in SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/set-transaction-isolation-level-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)
- [Default transaction isolation level in MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html)
