A database transaction refers to a sequence of read/write operations that are _guaranteed_ to either succeed or fail as a whole. This section describes the ways in which the Prisma Client API supports transactions.

- For more in-depth examples and use cases, refer to the üìñ [transactions guide](/guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide).
- For information about transactions in general and the reasoning behind Prisma's current solutions, see ‚úç [Blog: How Prisma supports transactions](https://www.prisma.io/blog/how-prisma-supports-transactions-x45s1d5l0ww1).

## About transactions in Prisma

Prisma provides the following options for using transactions:

- [Nested writes](#nested-writes): use the Prisma Client API to process multiple operations on one or more related records inside the same transaction.
- [Batch / bulk transactions](#batchbulk-operations): process one or more operations in bulk with `updateMany`, `deleteMany`, and `createMany`.
- The Prisma Client `$transaction` API:
  - [Sequential operations](#sequential-prisma-client-operations): pass an array of Prisma Client queries to be executed sequentially inside a transaction, using `$transaction<R>(queries: PrismaPromise<R>[]): Promise<R[]>`.
  - [Interactive transactions](#interactive-transactions-in-preview) (in Preview): pass a function that can contain user code including Prisma Client queries, non-Prisma code and other control flow to be executed in a transaction, using `$transaction<R>(fn: (prisma: PrismaClient) => R, options?: object): R`

## Nested writes

A [nested write](relation-queries#nested-writes) lets you perform a single Prisma Client API call with multiple _operations_ that touch multiple [_related_](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations) records. For example, creating a _user_ together with a _post_ or updating an _order_ together with an _invoice_. Prisma Client ensures that all operations succeed or fail as a whole.

The following example demonstrates a nested write with `create`:

```ts
// Create a new user with two posts in a
// single transaction
const newUser: User = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: [
        { title: 'Join the Prisma Slack on https://slack.prisma.io' },
        { title: 'Follow @prisma on Twitter' },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

The following example demonstrates a nested write with `update`:

```ts
// Change the author of a post in a single transaction
const updatedPost: Post = await prisma.post.update({
  where: { id: 42 },
  data: {
    author: {
      connect: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    },
  },
})
```

> Refer to the üìñ [transactions guide](/guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide#nested-writes) for more examples.

## Batch/bulk operations

The following bulk operations run as transactions:

- `deleteMany`
- `updateMany`
- `createMany`

> Refer to the üìñ [transactions guide](/guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide#bulk-operations) for more examples.

## The <inlinecode>$transaction</inlinecode> API

The `$transaction` API can be used in two ways:

- [Sequential operations](#sequential-prisma-client-operations): Pass an array of Prisma Client queries to be executed sequentially inside of a transaction.

  `$transaction<R>(queries: PrismaPromise<R>[]): Promise<R[]>`

- [Interactive transactions (Preview)](#interactive-transactions-in-preview): Pass a function that can contain user code including Prisma Client queries, non-Prisma code and other control flow to be executed in a transaction.

  `$transaction<R>(fn: (prisma: PrismaClient) => R): R`

> **Note**: to use interactive transactions you will need to [enable it as a Preview feature](/guides/upgrade-guides/upgrading-to-use-preview-features#enabling-preview-features).

### Sequential Prisma Client operations

The following query returns all posts that match the provided filter as well as a count of all posts:

```ts
const [posts, totalPosts] = await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.post.findMany({ where: { title: { contains: 'prisma' } } }),
  prisma.post.count(),
])
```

You can also use raw queries inside of a `$transaction`:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="SQL Databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>

<tab>

```ts
const [userList, updateUser] = await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 'title' FROM User`,
  prisma.$executeRaw`UPDATE User SET name = 'Hello' WHERE id = 2;`,
])
```

</tab>

<tab>

```ts
const [findRawData, aggregateRawData, commandRawData] =
  await prisma.$transaction([
    prisma.user.findRaw({
      filter: { age: { $gt: 25 } },
    }),
    prisma.user.aggregateRaw({
      pipeline: [
        { $match: { status: 'registered' } },
        { $group: { _id: '$country', total: { $sum: 1 } } },
      ],
    }),
    prisma.$runCommandRaw({
      aggregate: 'User',
      pipeline: [
        { $match: { name: 'Bob' } },
        { $project: { email: true, _id: false } },
      ],
      explain: false,
    }),
  ])
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

Instead of immediately awaiting the result of each operation when it's performed, the operation itself is stored in a variable first which later is submitted to the database with a method called `$transaction`. Prisma Client will ensure that either all three `create` operations succeed or none of them succeed.

> **Note**: Operations are executed according to the order they are placed in the transaction. Using a query in a transaction does not influence the order of operations in the query itself.
>
> Refer to the üìñ [transactions guide](/guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide#transaction-api) for more examples.

From version 4.4.0, the sequential operations transaction API has a second parameter. You can use the following optional configuration option in this parameter:

- `isolationLevel`: Sets the [transaction isolation level](#transaction-isolation-level). By default this is set to the value currently configured in your database.

For example:

```ts
await prisma.$transaction(
  [
    prisma.resource.deleteMany({ where: { name: 'name' } }),
    prisma.resource.createMany({ data }),
  ],
  {
    isolationLevel: Prisma.TransactionIsolationLevel.Serializable, // optional, default defined by database configuration
  }
)
```

### Interactive transactions (in Preview)

Sometimes you need more control over what queries execute within a transaction. Interactive transactions are meant to provide you with an escape hatch.

**Note**: If you use interactive transactions, then you cannot use the [Data Proxy](/data-platform/data-proxy#providing-the-connection-string-to-prisma-migrate) at the same time.

To enable interactive transactions, add `interactiveTransactions` to the generator of your Prisma Schema:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["interactiveTransactions"]
}
```

Then you can pass an async function into [`$transaction`](/guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide#transaction-api).

The first argument passed into this async function is an instance of Prisma Client. Below, we will call this instance `tx`. Any Prisma call invoked on this `tx` instance is encapsulated into the transaction.

Let's look at an example:

Imagine that you are building an online banking system. One of the actions to perform is to send money from one person to another.

As experienced developers, we want to make sure that during the transfer,

- the amount doesn't disappear
- the amount isn't doubled

This is a great use-case for interactive transactions because we need to perform logic in-between the writes to check the balance.

In the example below, Alice and Bob each have $100 in their account. If they try to send more money than they have, the transfer is rejected.

Alice is expected to be able to make 1 transfer for $100 while the other transfer would be rejected. This would result in Alice having $0 and Bob having $200.

```tsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function transfer(from: string, to: string, amount: number) {
  return await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    // 1. Decrement amount from the sender.
    const sender = await tx.account.update({
      data: {
        balance: {
          decrement: amount,
        },
      },
      where: {
        email: from,
      },
    })

    // 2. Verify that the sender's balance didn't go below zero.
    if (sender.balance < 0) {
      throw new Error(`${from} doesn't have enough to send ${amount}`)
    }

    // 3. Increment the recipient's balance by amount
    const recipient = await tx.account.update({
      data: {
        balance: {
          increment: amount,
        },
      },
      where: {
        email: to,
      },
    })

    return recipient
  })
}

async function main() {
  // This transfer is successful
  await transfer('alice@prisma.io', 'bob@prisma.io', 100)
  // This transfer fails because Alice doesn't have enough funds in her account
  await transfer('alice@prisma.io', 'bob@prisma.io', 100)
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

In the example above, both `update` queries run within a database transaction. When the application reaches the end of the function, the transaction is **committed** to the database.

If your application encounters an error along the way, the async function will throw an exception and automatically **rollback** the transaction.

To catch the exception, you can wrap `$transaction` in a try-catch block:

```js
try {
  await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    // Code running in a transaction...
  })
} catch (err) {
  // Handle the rollback...
}
```

The transaction API has a second parameter. For interactive transactions, you can use the following optional configuration options in this parameter:

- `maxWait`: The maximum amount of time the Prisma Client will wait to acquire a transaction from the database. The default value is 2 seconds.
- `timeout`: The maximum amount of time the interactive transaction can run before being canceled and rolled back. The default value is 5 seconds.
- `isolationLevel`: Sets the [transaction isolation level](#transaction-isolation-level). By default this is set to the value currently configured in your database.

For example:

```jsx
await prisma.$transaction(
  async (tx) => {
    // Code running in a transaction...
  },
  {
    maxWait: 5000, // default: 2000
    timeout: 10000, // default: 5000
    isolationLevel: Prisma.TransactionIsolationLevel.Serializable, // optional, default defined by database configuration
  }
)
```

<Admonition type="warning">

**Use interactive transactions with caution**. Keeping transactions
open for a long time hurts database performance and can even cause deadlocks.
Try to avoid performing network requests and executing slow queries inside your
transaction functions. We recommend you get in and out as quick as possible!

</Admonition>

### Transaction isolation level

<Admonition type="info">

This feature is not available on MongoDB, because MongoDB does not support isolation levels.

</Admonition>

You can set the transaction [isolation level](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/intro/database-glossary#isolation-levels) for transactions in the following Prisma versions:

- For interactive transactions from version 4.2.0
- For sequential operations from version 4.4.0

<Admonition type="info">

**In earlier versions**<br /><br />
In versions before 4.2.0 (for interactive transactions), or 4.4.0 (for sequential operations), you cannot configure the transaction isolation level at a Prisma level. The isolation level is not explicitly set by Prisma, so the [isolation level configured in your database](#database-specific-information-on-isolation-levels) is used.

</Admonition>

#### Set the isolation level

To set the transaction isolation level, use the `isolationLevel` option in the second parameter of the API.

For sequential operations:

```ts
await prisma.$transaction(
  [
    // Prisma Client operations running in a transaction...
  ],
  {
    isolationLevel: Prisma.TransactionIsolationLevel.Serializable, // optional, default defined by database configuration
  }
)
```

For an interactive transaction:

```jsx
await prisma.$transaction(
  async (prisma) => {
    // Code running in a transaction...
  },
  {
    isolationLevel: Prisma.TransactionIsolationLevel.Serializable, // optional, default defined by database configuration
    maxWait: 5000, // default: 2000
    timeout: 10000, // default: 5000
  }
)
```

#### Supported isolation levels

Prisma Client supports the following isolation levels if they are available in the underlying database:

- `ReadUncommitted`
- `ReadCommitted`
- `RepeatableRead`
- `Snapshot`
- `Serializable`

The isolation levels available for each database connector are as follows:

| Database    | `ReadUncommitted` | `ReadCommitted` | `RepeatableRead` | `Snapshot` | `Serializable` |
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| PostgreSQL  | ‚úîÔ∏è                | ‚úîÔ∏è              | ‚úîÔ∏è               | No         | ‚úîÔ∏è             |
| MySQL       | ‚úîÔ∏è                | ‚úîÔ∏è              | ‚úîÔ∏è               | No         | ‚úîÔ∏è             |
| SQL Server  | ‚úîÔ∏è                | ‚úîÔ∏è              | ‚úîÔ∏è               | ‚úîÔ∏è         | ‚úîÔ∏è             |
| CockroachDB | No                | No              | No               | No         | ‚úîÔ∏è             |
| SQLite      | No                | No              | No               | No         | ‚úîÔ∏è             |

By default, Prisma Client sets the isolation level to the value currently configured in your database.

The isolation levels configured by default in each database are as follows:

| Database    | Default          |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| PostgreSQL  | `ReadCommitted`  |
| MySQL       | `RepeatableRead` |
| SQL Server  | `ReadCommitted`  |
| CockroachDB | `Serializable`   |
| SQLite      | `Serializable`   |

#### Database-specific information on isolation levels

See the following resources:

- [Transaction isolation levels in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DEFAULT-TRANSACTION-ISOLATION)
- [Transaction isolation levels in Microsoft SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/set-transaction-isolation-level-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)
- [Transaction isolation levels in MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html)

CockroachDB and SQLite only support the `Serializable` isolation level.
