<TopBlock>

Prisma Client allows you to filter records on any combination of model fields, including related models, and supports a variety of filter conditions.

The following query:

* Returns all `User` records with at least one published post _and_ an email address that ends with `prisma.io`
* Returns all `User` fields
* Includes all related `Post` records where `published` equals `true`

```js
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: 'prisma.io',
    },
    posts: {
      some: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    posts: {
      where: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

For examples, see:

- [Basic filtering](crud#get-a-filtered-list-of-records) - for example, return all users with `prisma.io` email addresses
- [Filter related records](working-with-relations#filter-the-relations-list) - for example, return users and their published posts from the last year _only_
- [Filter _on_ related record properties](working-with-relations#filtering) - for example, only return users _with_ at least one published post

Reference:

- Operators list (`AND`, `OR`, `equals`, `contains`)
- Nested operators (`some`, `every`, `none`)

## Filtering

### Case-insensitive filtering

Case-insensitive filtering [is available as a feature for the PostgreSQL provider](case-sensitivity#options-for-case-insensitive-filtering). MySQL and MariaDB are case-insensitive by default, and do not require a Prisma Client feature to make case-insensitive filtering possible.

To use case-insensitive filtering, add the `mode` property to a particular filter and specify `insensitive`:

```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: "prisma.io",
|      mode: "insensitive", // Default value: default
    },
    name: {
       equals: "Archibald" // Default mode
    }
  },
});
```

## Sorting

Use [`orderBy`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#orderby) <span class="api"></span> to sort a list of records or a nested list of records by a particular field or set of fields. For example, the following query returns all `User` records sorted by `role` and `name`, **and** each user's posts sorted by `title`:

<Cmd>

```ts
const usersWithPosts = await prisma.user.findMany({
  orderBy: [
    {
      role: 'desc',
    },
    {
      email: 'desc',
    },
  ],
  include: {
    posts: {
      orderBy: {
        title: "desc",
      },
      select: {
        title: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

</Cmd>

<CmdResult>

```json
[
  {
      "email": "kwame@prisma.io",
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Kwame",
      "role": "USER",
      "posts": [
          {
              "title": "Prisma in five minutes"
          },
          {
              "title": "Happy Table Friends: Relations in Prisma"
          }
      ]
  },
  {
      "email": "emily@prisma.io",
      "id": 5,
      "name": "Emily",
      "role": "USER",
      "posts": [
          {
              "title": "Prisma Day 2020"
          },
          {
              "title": "My first day at Prisma"
          },
          {
              "title": "All about databases"
          }
      ]
  }
]
```

</CmdResult>

> **Note**: You can also [sort lists of nested records when you use `findUnique`](#sort-one-users-nested-list-of-post-records)
 to retrieve a single record by ID.
 
### Can I sort by the property of a nested `model`?

Follow [issue #249 on GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js/issues/249).

### Can I sort by an aggregate value (for example, by user's post count)?

Follow [issue #1 on GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js/issues/1).

### Can I perform case-insensitive sorting?
