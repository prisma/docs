Prisma Client supports filtering and sorting with the `where` and `orderBy` query options respectively.

</TopBlock>

## Filtering

Prisma Client allows you to filter records on any combination of model fields, [including related models](#filter-on-relations), and supports a variety of [filter conditions](#filter-conditions-and-operators).

The following query:

- Returns all `User` records with:
  - an email address that ends with `prisma.io` _and_
  - at least one published post (a relation query)
- Returns all `User` fields
- Includes all related `Post` records where `published` equals `true`

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: 'prisma.io',
    },
    posts: {
      some: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    posts: {
      where: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```json5
[
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Ellen',
    email: 'ellen@prisma.io',
    role: 'USER',
    posts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'How to build a house',
        published: true,
        authorId: 1,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        title: 'How to cook kohlrabi',
        published: true,
        authorId: 1,
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

### Filter conditions and operators

Refer to the Prisma Client reference documentation for [a full list of operators](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#filter-conditions-and-operators) <span class="api"></span>, such as `startsWith` and `contains`.

#### Combining operators

You can use operators (such as [`NOT`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#not) <span class="api"></span> and [`OR`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#or) <span class="api"></span>) to filter by a combination of conditions. The following query returns all users with an `email` that ends in `"prisma.io"` or `"gmail.com"`, but not `"hotmail.com"`:

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      {
        email: {
          endsWith: 'prisma.io',
        },
      },
      { email: { endsWith: 'gmail.com' } },
    ],
    NOT: {
      email: {
        endsWith: 'hotmail.com',
      },
    },
  },
  select: {
    email: true,
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```json5
[{ email: 'yewande@prisma.io' }, { email: `raheem@gmail.com` }]
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

### Filter on relations

Prisma Client supports [filtering on related records](relation-queries#relation-filters). For example, in the following schema, a user can have many blog posts:

```prisma highlight=5,12-13;normal
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String?
  email String  @unique
  posts Post[] // User can have many posts
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  published Boolean @default(true)
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}
```

The one-to-many relation between `User` and `Post` allows you to query users based on their posts - for example, the following query returns all users where _at least one_ post (`some`) has more than 10 views:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    posts: {
      some: {
        views: {
          gt: 10,
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

You can also query posts based on the properties of the author. For example, the following query returns all posts where the author's `email` contains `"prisma.io"`:

```ts
const res = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    author: {
      email: {
        contains: 'prisma.io',
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Filter on scalar lists / arrays

Scalar lists (for example, `String[]`) have a special set of [filter conditions](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#scalar-list-filters) <span class="api"></span> - for example, the following query returns all posts where the `tags` array contains `databases`:

```ts
const posts = await client.post.findMany({
  where: {
    tags: {
      has: 'databases',
    },
  },
})
```

### Case-insensitive filtering

Case-insensitive filtering [is available as a feature for the PostgreSQL and MongoDB providers](case-sensitivity#options-for-case-insensitive-filtering). MySQL, MariaDB and Microsoft SQL Server are case-insensitive by default, and do not require a Prisma Client feature to make case-insensitive filtering possible.

To use case-insensitive filtering, add the `mode` property to a particular filter and specify `insensitive`:

```ts highlight=5;normal
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: 'prisma.io',
      mode: 'insensitive', // Default value: default
    },
    name: {
      equals: 'Archibald', // Default mode
    },
  },
})
```

See also: [Case sensitivity](case-sensitivity)

## Sorting

Use [`orderBy`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#orderby) <span class="api"></span> to sort a list of records or a nested list of records by a particular field or set of fields. For example, the following query returns all `User` records sorted by `role` and `name`, **and** each user's posts sorted by `title`:

<CodeWithResult>

<cmd>

```ts
const usersWithPosts = await prisma.user.findMany({
  orderBy: [
    {
      role: 'desc',
    },
    {
      name: 'desc',
    },
  ],
  include: {
    posts: {
      orderBy: {
        title: 'desc',
      },
      select: {
        title: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```json
[
  {
    "email": "kwame@prisma.io",
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Kwame",
    "role": "USER",
    "posts": [
      {
        "title": "Prisma in five minutes"
      },
      {
        "title": "Happy Table Friends: Relations in Prisma"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "email": "emily@prisma.io",
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Emily",
    "role": "USER",
    "posts": [
      {
        "title": "Prisma Day 2020"
      },
      {
        "title": "My first day at Prisma"
      },
      {
        "title": "All about databases"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

> **Note**: You can also [sort lists of nested records](relation-queries#filter-a-list-of-relations)
> to retrieve a single record by ID.

### Sort by relation

You can also sort by properties of a relation. For example, the following query sorts all posts by the author's email address:

```ts
const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  orderBy: {
    author: {
      email: 'asc',
    },
  },
})
```

### Sort by relation aggregate value

In [2.19.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/2.19.0) and later, you can sort by the **count of related records**.

For example, the following query sorts users by the number of related posts:

```ts
const getActiveUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  take: 10,
  orderBy: {
    posts: {
      count: 'desc',
    },
  },
})
```

> **Note**: It is not currently possible to [return the count of a relation](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5079).

### Sort by relevance (PostgreSQL)

In [3.5.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/3.5.0) and later, when using PostgresSQL you can sort records by relevance to the query. This uses the relevance ranking functions from PostgreSQL's full text search feature, which are explained further in [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/textsearch-controls.html).

Ordering by relevance can be used either separately from or together with the `search` filter: `_relevance` is used to order the list, while `search` filters the unordered list. For example, the following query uses `_relevance` to order the list of users by relevance to the search term `'developer'` in their bio, and `search` to filter the list:

```ts
const getUsersByRelevance = await prisma.user.findMany({
  take: 10,
  orderBy: {
    _relevance: {
      fields: ['bio'],
      search: 'developer',
      sort: 'asc',
    },
  },
})
```
