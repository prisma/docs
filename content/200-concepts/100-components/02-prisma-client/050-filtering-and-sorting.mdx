Prisma Client supports filtering and sorting with the `where` and `orderBy` query options respectively.

</TopBlock>

## Filtering

Prisma Client allows you to filter records on any combination of model fields, [including related models](#filter-on-relations), and supports a variety of [filter conditions](#filter-conditions-and-operators).

The following query:

- Returns all `User` records with:
  - an email address that ends with `prisma.io` _and_
  - at least one published post (a relation query)
- Returns all `User` fields
- Includes all related `Post` records where `published` equals `true`

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: 'prisma.io',
    },
    posts: {
      some: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    posts: {
      where: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```json5 no-copy
[
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Ellen',
    email: 'ellen@prisma.io',
    role: 'USER',
    posts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'How to build a house',
        published: true,
        authorId: 1,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        title: 'How to cook kohlrabi',
        published: true,
        authorId: 1,
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

### Filter conditions and operators

Refer to the Prisma Client reference documentation for [a full list of operators](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#filter-conditions-and-operators) <span class="api"></span>, such as `startsWith` and `contains`.

#### Combining operators

You can use operators (such as [`NOT`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#not) <span class="api"></span> and [`OR`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#or) <span class="api"></span>) to filter by a combination of conditions. The following query returns all users with an `email` that ends in `"prisma.io"` or `"gmail.com"`, but not `"hotmail.com"`:

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      {
        email: {
          endsWith: 'prisma.io',
        },
      },
      { email: { endsWith: 'gmail.com' } },
    ],
    NOT: {
      email: {
        endsWith: 'hotmail.com',
      },
    },
  },
  select: {
    email: true,
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```json5 no-copy
[{ email: 'yewande@prisma.io' }, { email: `raheem@gmail.com` }]
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

### Filter on relations

Prisma Client supports [filtering on related records](relation-queries#relation-filters). For example, in the following schema, a user can have many blog posts:

```prisma highlight=5,12-13;normal
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String?
  email String  @unique
  posts Post[] // User can have many posts
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  published Boolean @default(true)
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}
```

The one-to-many relation between `User` and `Post` allows you to query users based on their posts - for example, the following query returns all users where _at least one_ post (`some`) has more than 10 views:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    posts: {
      some: {
        views: {
          gt: 10,
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

You can also query posts based on the properties of the author. For example, the following query returns all posts where the author's `email` contains `"prisma.io"`:

```ts
const res = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    author: {
      email: {
        contains: 'prisma.io',
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Filter on scalar lists / arrays

Scalar lists (for example, `String[]`) have a special set of [filter conditions](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#scalar-list-filters) <span class="api"></span> - for example, the following query returns all posts where the `tags` array contains `databases`:

```ts
const posts = await client.post.findMany({
  where: {
    tags: {
      has: 'databases',
    },
  },
})
```

### Case-insensitive filtering

Case-insensitive filtering [is available as a feature for the PostgreSQL and MongoDB providers](case-sensitivity#options-for-case-insensitive-filtering). MySQL, MariaDB and Microsoft SQL Server are case-insensitive by default, and do not require a Prisma Client feature to make case-insensitive filtering possible.

To use case-insensitive filtering, add the `mode` property to a particular filter and specify `insensitive`:

```ts highlight=5;normal
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: 'prisma.io',
      mode: 'insensitive', // Default value: default
    },
    name: {
      equals: 'Archibald', // Default mode
    },
  },
})
```

See also: [Case sensitivity](case-sensitivity)

## Sorting

Use [`orderBy`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#orderby) <span class="api"></span> to sort a list of records or a nested list of records by a particular field or set of fields. For example, the following query returns all `User` records sorted by `role` and `name`, **and** each user's posts sorted by `title`:

<CodeWithResult>

<cmd>

```ts
const usersWithPosts = await prisma.user.findMany({
  orderBy: [
    {
      role: 'desc',
    },
    {
      name: 'desc',
    },
  ],
  include: {
    posts: {
      orderBy: {
        title: 'desc',
      },
      select: {
        title: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```json no-copy
[
  {
    "email": "kwame@prisma.io",
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Kwame",
    "role": "USER",
    "posts": [
      {
        "title": "Prisma in five minutes"
      },
      {
        "title": "Happy Table Friends: Relations in Prisma"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "email": "emily@prisma.io",
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Emily",
    "role": "USER",
    "posts": [
      {
        "title": "Prisma Day 2020"
      },
      {
        "title": "My first day at Prisma"
      },
      {
        "title": "All about databases"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

> **Note**: You can also [sort lists of nested records](relation-queries#filter-a-list-of-relations)
> to retrieve a single record by ID.

### Sort by relation

You can also sort by properties of a relation. For example, the following query sorts all posts by the author's email address:

```ts
const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  orderBy: {
    author: {
      email: 'asc',
    },
  },
})
```

### Sort by relation aggregate value

In [2.19.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/2.19.0) and later, you can sort by the **count of related records**.

For example, the following query sorts users by the number of related posts:

```ts
const getActiveUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  take: 10,
  orderBy: {
    posts: {
      _count: 'desc',
    },
  },
})
```

> **Note**: It is not currently possible to [return the count of a relation](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5079).

### Sort by relevance (PostgreSQL)

In [3.5.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/3.5.0) and later, when using PostgresSQL you can sort records by relevance to the query using the `_relevance` keyword. This uses the relevance ranking functions from PostgreSQL's full text search feature, which are explained further in [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/textsearch-controls.html).

Enable order by relevance with the `fullTextSearch` [preview feature](/concepts/components/prisma-client/full-text-search):

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch"]
}
```

Ordering by relevance can be used either separately from or together with the `search` filter: `_relevance` is used to order the list, while `search` filters the unordered list. For example, the following query uses `_relevance` to order the list of users by relevance to the search term `'developer'` in their bio, and `search` to filter the list:

```ts
const getUsersByRelevance = await prisma.user.findMany({
  take: 10,
  orderBy: {
    _relevance: {
      fields: ['bio'],
      search: 'developer',
      sort: 'asc',
    },
  },
})
```

### Sort with null records first or last

In version 4.1.0 and later, you can sort the results so that records with `null` fields appear either first or last.

To use this feature, in the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, enable the `orderByNulls` [preview feature](/concepts/components/preview-features/client-preview-features):

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["orderByNulls"]
}
```

<Admonition type="info">

**Note:** You can only sort by nulls on optional [scalar](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#scalar-fields) fields. If you try to sort by nulls on a required or [relation](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#relation-fields) field, Prisma Client throws a [P2009 error](/reference/api-reference/error-reference#p2009).

</Admonition>

Example: If `updatedAt` is an optional field, then the following query sorts posts by `updatedAt`, with null records at the end:

```ts
const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  orderBy: {
    updatedAt: { sort: 'asc', nulls: 'last' },
  },
})
```
