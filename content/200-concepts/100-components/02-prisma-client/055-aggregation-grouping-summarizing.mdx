<TopBlock>

Prisma Client allows you to count records, aggregate number fields, and select distinct field values.

</TopBlock>

## Aggregate

Prisma Client allows you to [`aggregate`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#aggregate) <span class="api"></span> on the **number** fields (such as `Int` and `Float`) of a model. The following query returns the average age of all users:

```ts
const aggregations = await prisma.user.aggregate({
  _avg: {
    age: true,
  },
})

console.log('Average age:' + aggregations._avg.age)
```

You can combine aggregation with filtering and ordering. For example, the following query returns the average age of users:

- Ordered by `age` ascending
- Where `email` contains `prisma.io`
- Limited to the 10 users

```ts
const aggregations = await prisma.user.aggregate({
  _avg: {
    age: true,
  },
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: 'prisma.io',
    },
  },
  orderBy: {
    age: 'asc',
  },
  take: 10,
})

console.log('Average age:' + aggregations._avg.age)
```

### Aggregate values are nullable

In [2.21.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.21.0) and later, aggregations on **nullable fields** can return a `number` or `null`. This excludes `count`, which always returns 0 if no records are found.

Consider the following query, where `age` is nullable in the schema:

<CodeWithResult expanded={true}>
<cmd>

```ts
const aggregations = await prisma.user.aggregate({
  _avg: {
    age: true,
  },
  _count: {
    age: true,
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```js no-copy
{
  _avg: {
    age: null
  },
  _count: {
    age: 9
  }
}
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

The query returns `{ _avg: { age: null } }` in either of the following scenarios:

- There are no users
- The value of every user's `age` field is `null`

This allows you to differentiate between the true aggregate value (which could be zero) and no data.

## Group by

Prisma Client's [`groupBy`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#groupby) <span class="api"></span> allows you to **group records** by one or more field values - such as `country`, or `country` and `city` and **perform aggregations** on each group, such as finding the average age of people living in a particular city. `groupBy` is a GA in [2.20.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/2.20.0) and later.

The following video uses `groupBy` to summarize total COVID-19 cases by continent:

<div class="videoWrapper">

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BdlCPdPaorY"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

</div>

The following example groups all users by the `country` field and returns the total number of profile views for each country:

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ['country'],
  _sum: {
    profileViews: true,
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```js no-copy
;[
  { country: 'Germany', _sum: { profileViews: 126 } },
  { country: 'Sweden', _sum: { profileViews: 0 } },
]
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

### <inlinecode>groupBy</inlinecode> and filtering

`groupBy` supports two levels of filtering: `where` and `having`.

#### Filter records with `where`

Use `where` to filter all records **before grouping**. The following example groups users by country and sums profile views, but only includes users where the email address contains `prisma.io`:

```ts highlight=3-7;normal
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ['country'],
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: 'prisma.io',
    },
  },
  _sum: {
    profileViews: true,
  },
})
```

#### Filter groups with <inlinecode>having</inlinecode>

Use `having` to filter **entire groups** by an aggregate value such as the sum or average of a field, not individual records - for example, only return groups where the _average_ `profileViews` is greater than 100:

```ts highlight=11-17;normal
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ['country'],
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: 'prisma.io',
    },
  },
  _sum: {
    profileViews: true,
  },
  having: {
    profileViews: {
      _avg: {
        gt: 100,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

##### Use case for <inlinecode>having</inlinecode>

The primary use case for `having` is to filter on aggregations. We recommend that you use `where` to reduce the size of your data set as far as possible _before_ grouping, because doing so ✔ reduces the number of records the database has to return and ✔ makes use of indices.

For example, the following query groups all users that are _not_ from Sweden or Ghana:

```ts highlight=4-6;normal
const fd = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ['country'],
  where: {
    country: {
      notIn: ['Sweden', 'Ghana'],
    },
  },
  _sum: {
    profileViews: true,
  },
  having: {
    profileViews: {
      _min: {
        gte: 10,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The following query technically achieves the same result, but excludes users from Ghana _after_ grouping. This does not confer any benefit and is not recommended practice.

```ts highlight=4-6,12-14;normal
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ['country'],
  where: {
    country: {
      not: 'Sweden',
    },
  },
  _sum: {
    profileViews: true,
  },
  having: {
    country: {
      not: 'Ghana',
    },
    profileViews: {
      _min: {
        gte: 10,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

> **Note**: Within `having`, you can only filter on aggregate values _or_ fields available in `by`.

### <inlinecode>groupBy</inlinecode> and ordering

The following constraints apply when you combine `groupBy` and `orderBy`:

- You can `orderBy` fields that are present in `by`
- You can `orderBy` aggregate (Preview in 2.21.0 and later)
- If you use `skip` and/or `take` with `groupBy`, you must also include `orderBy` in the query

#### Order by aggregate group

You can **order by aggregate group**. Prisma added support for using `orderBy with aggregated groups in relational databases in version [2.21.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/2.21.0) and support for MongoDB in [3.4.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/3.4.0).

The following example sorts each `city` group by the number of users in that group (largest group first):

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const groupBy = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ['city'],
  _count: {
    city: true,
  },
  orderBy: {
    _count: {
      city: 'desc',
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```js no-copy
;[
  { city: 'Berlin', count: { city: 3 } },
  { city: 'Paris', count: { city: 2 } },
  { city: 'Amsterdam', count: { city: 1 } },
]
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

#### Order by field

The following query orders groups by country, skips the first two groups, and returns the 3rd and 4th group:

```ts
const groupBy = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ['country'],
  _sum: {
    profileViews: true,
  },
  orderBy: {
    country: 'desc',
  },
  skip: 2,
  take: 2,
})
```

### <inlinecode>groupBy</inlinecode> FAQ

#### Can I use `select` with `groupBy`?

You cannot use `select` with `groupBy`. However, all fields included in `by` are automatically returned.

#### What is the difference between using `where` and `having` with `groupBy`?

`where` filters all records before grouping, and `having` filters entire groups and supports filtering on an aggregate field value, such as the average or sum of a particular field in that group.

#### What is the difference between `groupBy` and `distinct`?

Both `distinct` and `groupBy` group records by one or more unique field values. `groupBy` allows you to aggregate data within each group - for example, return the average number of views on posts from Denmark - whereas distinct does not.

## Count

Use [`count`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#count) <span class="api"></span> to count the number of records or non-`null` field values. The following example query counts all users:

```ts
const userCount = await prisma.user.count()
```

### Count relations

The ability to count relations is available in version [3.0.1](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/3.0.1) and later.

<Admonition type="info">

**For versions before 3.0.1**<br />
You need to add the [preview feature](/concepts/components/preview-features/client-preview-features#enabling-a-prisma-client-preview-feature) `selectRelationCount` and then run `prisma generate`.

</Admonition>

To return a count of relations (for example, a user's post count), use the `_count` parameter with a nested `select` as shown:

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const usersWithCount = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: {
    _count: {
      select: { posts: true },
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```js no-copy
{ id: 1, _count: { posts: 3 } },
{ id: 2, _count: { posts: 2 } },
{ id: 3, _count: { posts: 2 } },
{ id: 4, _count: { posts: 0 } },
{ id: 5, _count: { posts: 0 } }
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

The `_count` parameter:

- Can be used inside a top-level `include` _or_ `select`
- Can be used with any query that returns records (including `delete`, `update`, and `findFirst`)
- Can return [multiple relation counts](#return-multiple-relation-counts)
- From version 4.3.0, can [filter relation counts](#filter-the-relation-count)

#### Return a relations count with <inlineCode>include</inlineCode>

The following query includes each user's post count in the results:

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const usersWithCount = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: {
    _count: {
      select: { posts: true },
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```js no-copy
{ id: 1, _count: { posts: 3 } },
{ id: 2, _count: { posts: 2 } },
{ id: 3, _count: { posts: 2 } },
{ id: 4, _count: { posts: 0 } },
{ id: 5, _count: { posts: 0 } }
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

#### Return a relations count with `select`

The following query uses `select` to return each user's post count and no other fields:

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const usersWithCount = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    _count: {
      select: { posts: true },
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```js no-copy
{
  _count: {
    posts: 3
  }
}
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

#### Return multiple relation counts

The following query returns a count of each user's `posts` and `recipes` and no other fields:

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const usersWithCount = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    _count: {
      select: {
        posts: true,
        recipes: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```js no-copy
{
  _count: {
    posts: 3,
    recipes: 9
  }
}
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

#### Filter the relation count

This feature is available from version 4.3.0. To use it, you need to add the [preview feature](/concepts/components/preview-features/client-preview-features#enabling-a-prisma-client-preview-feature) `filteredRelationCount`.

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["filteredRelationCount"]
}
```

Use `where` to filter the fields returned by the `_count` output type. You can do this on [scalar fields](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#scalar-fields), [relation fields](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#relation-fields) and fields of a [composite type](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-composite-types).

For example, the following query returns all user posts with the title "Hello!":

```ts
// Count all user posts with the title "Hello!"
await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    _count: {
      select: {
        posts: { where: { title: 'Hello!' } },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The following query finds all user posts with comments from an author named "Alice":

```ts
// Count all user posts that have comments
// whose author is named "Alice"
await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    _count: {
      select: {
        posts: {
          where: { comments: { some: { author: { is: { name: 'Alice' } } } } },
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Count non-`null` field values

In [2.15.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/2.15.0) and later, you can count all records as well as all instances of non-`null` field values. The following query returns a count of:

- All `User` records (`_all`)
- All non-`null` `name` values (not distinct values, just values that are not `null`)

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const userCount = await prisma.user.count({
  select: {
    _all: true, // Count all records
    name: true, // Count all non-null field values
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```js no-copy
{ _all: 30, name: 10 }
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

### Filtered count

`count` supports filtering. The following example query counts all users with more than 100 profile views:

```ts
const userCount = await prisma.user.count({
  where: {
    profileViews: {
      gte: 100,
    },
  },
})
```

The following example query counts a particular user's posts:

```ts
const postCount = await prisma.post.count({
  where: {
    authorId: 29,
  },
})
```

## Select distinct

Prisma Client allows you to filter duplicate rows from a Prisma Query response to a [`findMany`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#findMany) <span class="api"></span> query using [`distinct`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#distinct) <span class="api"></span>. `distinct` is often used in combination with [`select`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#select) <span class="api"></span> to identify certain unique combinations of values in the rows of your table.

The following example returns all fields for all `User` records with distinct `name` field values:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {},
  distinct: ['name'],
})
```

The following example returns distinct `role` field values (for example, `ADMIN` and `USER`):

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const distinctRoles = await prisma.user.findMany({
  distinct: ['role'],
  select: {
    role: true,
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```js no-copy
;[
  {
    role: 'USER',
  },
  {
    role: 'ADMIN',
  },
]
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

### <inlinecode>distinct</inlinecode> under the hood

Prisma's `distinct` option does not use SQL `SELECT DISTINCT`. Instead, `distinct` uses:

- A `SELECT` query
- In-memory post-processing to select distinct

It was designed in this way in order to **support `select` and `include`** as part of `distinct` queries.

The following example selects distinct on `gameId` and `playerId`, ordered by `score`, in order to return **each player's highest score per game**. The query uses `include` and `select` to include additional data:

- Select `score` (field on `Play`)
- Select related player name (relation between `Play` and `User`)
- Select related game name (relation between `Play` and `Game`)

<details><summary>Expand for sample schema</summary>

```prisma
model User {
  id   Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String?
  play Play[]
}

model Game {
  id   Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String?
  play Play[]
}

model Play {
  id       Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  score    Int?  @default(0)
  playerId Int?
  player   User? @relation(fields: [playerId], references: [id])
  gameId   Int?
  game     Game? @relation(fields: [gameId], references: [id])
}
```

</details>

<CodeWithResult>
<cmd>

```ts
const distinctScores = await prisma.play.findMany({
  distinct: ['playerId', 'gameId'],
  orderBy: {
    score: 'desc',
  },
  select: {
    score: true,
    game: {
      select: {
        name: true,
      },
    },
    player: {
      select: {
        name: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```code no-copy
[
  {
    score: 900,
    game: { name: 'Pacman' },
    player: { name: 'Bert Bobberton' }
  },
  {
    score: 400,
    game: { name: 'Pacman' },
    player: { name: 'Nellie Bobberton' }
  }
]
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

Without `select` and `distinct`, the query would return:

```
[
  {
    gameId: 2,
    playerId: 5
  },
  {
    gameId: 2,
    playerId: 10
  }
]
```
