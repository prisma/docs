Prisma Client allows you to count records, aggregate number fields, and select distinct field values.

</TopBlock>

## Aggregate

Prisma Client allows you to [`aggregate`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#aggregate) <span class="api"></span> on the **number** fields (such as `Int` and `Float`) of a model. The following query returns the average age of all users:

```ts
const aggregations = await prisma.user.aggregate({
  avg: {
    age: true,
  },
})

console.log('Average age:' + aggregations.avg.age)
```

You can combine aggregation with filtering and ordering. For example, the following query returns the average age of users:

- Ordered by `age` ascending
- Where `email` contains `prisma.io`
- Limited to the 10 users

```ts
const aggregations = await prisma.user.aggregate({
  avg: {
    age: true,
  },
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: 'prisma.io',
    },
  },
  orderBy: {
    age: 'asc',
  },
  take: 10,
})

console.log('Average age:' + aggregations.avg.age)
```

## Group by (Preview)

Prisma Client's [`groupBy`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#group-by-preview) <span class="api"></span> allows you to **group records** by one or more field values - such as `country`, or `country` and `city` and **perform aggregations** on each group, such as finding the average age of people living in a particular city.

The following video uses `groupBy` to summarize total COVID-19 cases by continent:

<div class="videoWrapper">

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BdlCPdPaorY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</div>

The following example groups all users by the `country` field and returns the total number of profile views for each country:

<CodeWithResult>
<Cmd>

```ts
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ['country'],
  sum: {
    profileViews: true,
  },
})
```

</Cmd>
<CmdResult>

```js
;[
  { country: 'Germany', sum: { profileViews: 126 } },
  { country: 'Sweden', sum: { profileViews: 0 } },
]
```

</CmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

`groupBy` is a preview feature. To enable this feature, add `"groupBy"` to the generator block in your schema as shown and run `prisma generate`:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["groupBy"]
}
```

### <inlinecode>groupBy</inlinecode> and filtering

`groupBy` supports two levels of filtering: `where` and `having`.

#### Filter records with `where`

Use `where` to filter all records **before grouping**. The following example groups users by country and sums profile views, but only includes users where the email address contains `prisma.io`:

```ts
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ["country"],
|  where: {
|    email: {
|      contains: "prisma.io"
|    }
|  },
  sum: {
    profileViews: true
  }
})
```

#### Filter groups with <inlinecode>having</inlinecode>

Use `having` to filter **entire groups** by an aggregate value such as the sum or average of a field, not individual records - for example, only return groups where the _average_ `profileViews` is greater than 100:

```ts highlight=11-17;normal
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ["country"],
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: "prisma.io"
    }
  },
  sum: {
    profileViews: true
  },
|  having: {
|    profileViews: {
|      avg: {
|        gt: 100
|      }
|    }
|  }
})
```

##### Use case for <inlinecode>having</inlinecode>

The primary use case for `having` is to filter on aggregations. We recommend that you use `where` to reduce the size of your data set as far as possible _before_ grouping, because doing so ✔ reduces the number of records the database has to return and ✔ makes use of indices.

For example, the following query groups all users that are _not_ from Sweden or Ghana:

```ts
const fd = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ["country"],
  where: {
|      country: {
|        notIn: ["Sweden", "Ghana"]
|      }
  },
  sum: {
    profileViews: true
  }
  having: {
    profileViews: {
      min: {
        gte: 10
      }
    }
  }
})
```

The following query technically achieves the same result, but excludes users from Ghana _after_ grouping. This does not confer any benefit and is not recommended practice.

```ts
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ["country"],
  where: {
|    country: {
|      not: "Sweden"
|    }
  },
  sum: {
    profileViews: true
  },
  having: {
|    country: {
|      not: "Ghana"
|    }
     profileViews: {
       min: {
        gte: 10
      }
    }
  }
})
```

> **Note**: Within `having`, you can only filter on aggregate values _or_ fields available in `by`.

### <inlinecode>groupBy</inlinecode> and ordering

The following constraints apply when you combine `groupBy` and `orderBy`:

- You can only `orderBy` fields that are present in `by`
- If you use `skip` and/or `take` with `groupBy`, you must also include `orderBy` in the query

The following query orders groups by country, skips the first two groups, and returns the 3rd and 4th group:

```ts
const groupBy = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ['country'],
  sum: {
    profileViews: true,
  },
  orderBy: {
    country: 'desc',
  },
  skip: 2,
  take: 2,
})
```

### <inlinecode>groupBy</inlinecode> FAQ

#### Can I use `select` with `groupBy`?

You cannot use `select` with `groupBy`. However, all fields included in `by` are automatically returned.

#### What is the difference between using `where` and `having` with `groupBy`?

`where` filters all records before grouping, and `having` filters entire groups and supports filtering on an aggregate field value, such as the average or sum of a particular field in that group.

#### What is the difference between `groupBy` and `distinct`?

Both `distinct` and `groupBy` group records by one or more unique field values. `groupBy` allows you to aggregate data within each group - for example, return the average number of views on posts from Denmark - whereas distinct does not.

## Count

Use [`count`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#count) <span class="api"></span> to count the number of records or non-`null` field values. The following example query counts all users:

```ts
const userCount = await prisma.user.count()
```

### Count non-`null` field values

In 2.15.0 and later, you can count all records as well as all instances of non-`null` field values. The following query returns a count of:

- All `User` records (`_all`)
- All non-`null` `name` values (not distinct values, just values that are not `null`)

<CodeWithResult>
<Cmd>

```ts
const userCount = await prisma.user.count({
  select: {
    _all: true, // Count all records
    name: true, // Count all non-null field values
  },
})
```

</Cmd>
<CmdResult>

```js
{ _all: 30, name: 10 }
```

</CmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

### Filtered count

`count` supports filtering. The following example query counts all users with more than 100 profile views:

```ts
const userCount = await prisma.user.count({
  where: {
    profileViews: {
      gte: 100,
    },
  },
})
```

The following example query counts a particular user's posts:

```ts
const postCount = await prisma.post.count({
  where: {
    authorId: 29,
  },
})
```

## Select distinct

Prisma Client allows you to filter duplicate rows from a Prisma Query response to a [`findMany`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#findMany) <span class="api"></span> query using [`distinct`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#distinct) <span class="api"></span>. `distinct` is often used in combination with [`select`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#select) <span class="api"></span> to identify certain unique combinations of values in the rows of your table.

The following example returns all fields for all `User` records with distinct `name` field values:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {},
  distinct: ['name'],
})
```

The following example returns distinct `role` field values (for example, `ADMIN` and `USER`):

<CodeWithResult>
<Cmd>

```ts
const distinctRoles = await prisma.user.findMany({
  distinct: ['role'],
  select: {
    role: true,
  },
})
```

</Cmd>
<CmdResult>

```js
;[
  {
    role: 'USER',
  },
  {
    role: 'ADMIN',
  },
]
```

</CmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

### <inlinecode>distinct</inlinecode> under the hood

Prisma's `distinct` option does not use SQL `SELECT DISTINCT`. Instad, `distinct` uses:

- A `SELECT` query
- In-memory post-processing to select distinct

It was designed in this way in order to **support `select` and `include`** as part of `distinct` queries.

The following example selects distinct on `gameId` and `playerId`, ordered by `score`, in order to return **each player's highest score per game**. The query uses `include` and `select` to include additional data:

- Select `score` (field on `Play`)
- Select related player name (relation between `Play` and `User`)
- Select related game name (relation between `Play` and `Game`)

<details><summary>Expand for sample schema</summary>

```prisma
model User {
  id           Int              @id @default(autoincrement())
  name         String?
  Play         Play[]
}

model Game {
  id   Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String?
}

model Play {
  id       Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  score    Int?  @default(0)
  playerId Int?
  player   User? @relation(fields: playerId, references: id)
  gameId Int?
  game Game? @relation(fields: gameId, references: id)
}
```

</details>

<CodeWithResult>
<Cmd>

```ts
const distinctScores = await prisma.play.findMany({
  distinct: ['playerId', 'gameId'],
  orderBy: {
    score: 'desc',
  },
  select: {
    score: true,
    game: {
      select: {
        name: true,
      },
    },
    player: {
      select: {
        name: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</Cmd>
<CmdResult>

```
[
  {
    score: 900,
    game: { name: 'Pacman' },
    player: { name: 'Bert Bobberton' }
  },
  {
    score: 400,
    game: { name: 'Pacman' },
    player: { name: 'Nellie Bobberton' }
  }
]
```

</CmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

Without `select` and `distinct`, the query would return:

```
[
  {
    gameId: 2,
    playerId: 5
  },
  {
    gameId: 2,
    playerId: 10
  }
]
```
