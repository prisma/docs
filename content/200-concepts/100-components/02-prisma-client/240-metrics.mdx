Prisma metrics give you a detailed insight into how Prisma Client interacts with your database. You can use this insight to help diagnose performance issues with your application.

<Admonition type="info">

If you want an even more detailed insight into your Prisma Client's performance, at the level of individual operations, see [Tracing](/concepts/components/prisma-client/opentelemetry-tracing).

## About metrics

You can export metrics in JSON or Prometheus formats and view them in a console log, or integrate them into an external metrics system, such as [StatsD](https://github.com/statsd/statsd) or [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). If you integrate them into an external metrics system, then you can view the metrics data over time. For example, you can use metrics to help diagnose how your application's number of idle and active connections changes.

Prisma Client provides the following metrics:

- Counters (always increase):

  - `prisma_client_queries_total`: The total number of Prisma Client queries executed.
  - `prisma_datasource_queries_total`: The total number of datasource queries executed (SQL queries in relational databases, and commands in MongoDB).
    - The value returned by `prisma_datasource_queries_total` can be greater than `prisma_client_queries_total`, because some Prisma Client operations create multiple queries.
  - `prisma_pool_connections_opened_total`: The total number of [pool connections](/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-pool#default-connection-pool-size) opened.
  - `prisma_pool_connections_closed_total`: The total number of pool connections closed.

- Gauges (can increase or decrease):

  - `prisma_pool_connections_open`: The number of currently open pool connections.
  - `prisma_pool_connections_busy`: The number of currently busy pool connections. These pool connections are currently executing a datasource query.
  - `prisma_pool_connections_idle`: The number of pool connections that are not currently being used. These pool connections are waiting for the next datasource query to run.
  - `prisma_client_queries_active`: The number of currently active transactions.
  - `prisma_client_queries_wait`: The number of Prisma Client queries currently waiting for a connection because all connections are in use.

- Histograms (metrics data divided into a collection of values; we call each container in the collection a "bucket"):

  - `prisma_client_queries_wait_histogram_ms`: The time waiting for a pool connection for all Prisma Client queries in ms.
  - `prisma_client_queries_duration_histogram_ms`: The execution time for all executed Prisma Client queries in ms. This includes the time taken to execute all database queries, and to carry out all database engine activities, such as joining data and transforming data to the correct format.
  - `prisma_datasource_queries_duration_histogram_ms`: The execution time for all executed Datasource queries in ms.

You can [add global labels to your metrics data](#global-labels) to help you group and separate your metrics, for example by infrastructure region or server.

## Prerequisites

To use Prisma metrics, you must do the following:

1. [Install the appropriate dependencies](#step-1-install-up-to-date-prisma-dependencies).
1. [Enable the `metrics` feature flag in your Prisma schema file](#step-2-enable-the-feature-flag-in-the-prisma-schema-file).

### Step 1. Install up-to-date Prisma dependencies

Use version `3.15.0` or higher of the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` npm packages.

```terminal
npm install prisma@latest --save-dev
npm install @prisma/client@latest --save
```

### Step 2: Enable the feature flag in the Prisma schema file

In the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, enable the `metrics` feature flag:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["metrics"]
}
```

## Retrieve metrics in JSON format

When you retrieve metrics in JSON format, you can use them in the format they are returned, or [send them to StatSD](#use-prisma-metrics-with-statsd) to visualize how they change over time.

To retrieve metrics in JSON format, add the following lines to your application code:

```ts
let metrics = await prisma.$metrics.json()
console.log(metrics)
```

This returns metrics as follows:

```json

        "count": 5
      },
      "description": "Histogram of the duration of all executed Datasource Queries in ms"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Histograms in JSON data

Each histogram "bucket" has two values. The first one is the upper bound of the bucket, and the second one is the count (the number of data values that fall into that bucket). In the following example, there are two instances of values between 11 and 20, and five instances of values between 21 and 30:

```json
...
[20, 2],
[30, 5],
...
```

### Use Prisma metrics with StatsD

You can send JSON-formatted metrics to [StatsD](https://github.com/statsd/statsd) to visualize your metrics data over time.

<Admonition type="info">

Note: You must provide counter metrics to StatsD as a series of values that are incremented or decremented from a previous retrieval of the metrics. However, Prisma counter
metrics return absolute values. Therefore, you must convert your counter metrics to a series of incremented and decremented values and send them to StatsD as gauge data. In the code example below, we convert counter metrics into incremented and decremented gauge data in `diffHistograms`.

</Admonition>

In the following example, we send metrics to StatsD every 10 seconds. This timing aligns with the default 10s flush rate of StatsD.

```ts
import StatsD from 'hot-shots'
let statsd = new StatsD({
  port: 8125,
})

let diffMetrics = (metrics: any) => {
  return metrics.map((metric: any) => {
    let prev = 0
    let diffBuckets = metric.value.buckets.map((values: any) => {
      let [bucket, value] = values
      let diff = value - prev
      prev = value
      return [bucket, diff]
    })
    metric.value.buckets = diffBuckets
    return metric
  })
}

let previousHistograms: any = null
let statsdSender = async () => {
  let metrics = await prisma.$metrics.json()

  metrics.counters.forEach((counter: any) => {
    statsd.gauge('prisma.' + counter.key, counter.value, (...res) => {})
  })

  metrics.gauges.forEach((counter: any) => {
    statsd.gauge('prisma.' + counter.key, counter.value, (...res) => {})
  })

  if (previousHistograms === null) {
    previousHistograms = diffMetrics(metrics.histograms)
    return
  }

  let diffHistograms = diffMetrics(metrics.histograms)

  diffHistograms.forEach((diffHistograms: any, histogramIndex: any) => {
    diffHistograms.value.buckets.forEach((values: any, bucketIndex: any) => {
      let [bucket, count] = values
      let [_, prev] =
        previousHistograms[histogramIndex].value.buckets[bucketIndex]
      let change = count - prev

      for (let sendTimes = 0; sendTimes < change; sendTimes++) {
        statsd.timing('prisma.' + diffHistograms.key, bucket)
      }
    })
  })

  previousHistograms = diffHistograms
}

setInterval(async () => await statsdSender(), 10000)
```

## Retrieve metrics in Prometheus format

When you retrieve Prisma metrics in Prometheus format, you can use them in the format they are returned, or [send them to the Prometheus metrics system](#use-prisma-metrics-with-the-prometheus-metrics-system) to visualize how they change over time.

To retrieve metrics in Prometheus format, add the following lines to your application code:

```ts
let metrics = await prisma.$metrics.prometheus()
console.log(metrics)
```

This returns metrics as follows:

```c

prisma_datasource_queries_duration_histogram_ms_sum 1.8407059999999997
prisma_datasource_queries_duration_histogram_ms_count 5
```

Metrics of type `histogram` expose three different class of values in the Prometheus format:

1. Multiple cumulative counters for observation buckets. These counters are suffixed with `_bucket{le="<upper inclusive bound>"}`. For example, `prisma_datasource_queries_duration_histogram_ms` has a counter exposed as `prisma_datasource_queries_duration_histogram_ms_bucket{le="1"}`

   When an observed value is less than or equal to the upper inclusive bound of a bucket, then Prisma Metrics increments that bucket by 1. Suppose that you have buckets with the upper inclusive bounds 0, 1, 5, 10, and 50 respectively. If the observed value is 5 then Prisma Metrics increments the third bucket onwards, because the value is greater than 0 and greater than 1, but less than or equal to 5, 10, and 50.

2. A single **total sum** for all observed values. This counter is suffixed with `_sum`. For example the total sum of `prisma_datasource_queries_duration_histogram_ms` is exposed as `prisma_datasource_queries_duration_histogram_ms_sum`.
3. The **count** of the number of events that have been observed. This counter is suffixed with `_count`. For example the total count of `prisma_datasource_queries_duration_histogram_ms` events is exposed as `prisma_datasource_queries_duration_histogram_ms_count`.

For more information, read the Prometheus documentation on [metric types](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).

### Use Prisma metrics with the Prometheus metrics system

In the majority of cases, Prometheus must scrape an endpoint to retrieve metrics. The following example shows how to send data with `Express.js`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";

const app = express();
const port = 4000;
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

app.get("/metrics", async (_req, res: Response) => {
  let metrics = await prisma.$metrics.prometheus();
  res.end(metrics);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
})
```

The following example shows how to combine Prisma metrics with other Prometheus client libraries that are also served with a REST API endpoint in conjunction with `Express.js`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";
import prom from "prom-client";

const app = express();
const port = 4000;
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const register = new prom.Registry();
prom.collectDefaultMetrics({ register });

app.get('/metrics', async (_req, res: Response) => {
  let prismaMetrics = await prisma.$metrics.prometheus();
  let appMetrics = await register.metrics();
  res.end(prismaMetrics + appMetrics);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
})
```

## Global labels

You can add global labels to your metrics to help you group and separate your metrics. Each instance of Prisma Client adds these labels to the metrics that it generates. For example, you can group your metrics by infrastructure region, or by server, with a label like `{ server: us_server1', 'app_version': 'one' }`.

Global labels work with JSON and Prometheus-formatted metrics.

For example, to add global labels to JSON-format metrics, add the following code to your application:

```ts
let metrics = prisma.$metrics.json({
  globalLabels: { server: 'us_server1', app_version: 'one' },
})
console.log(metrics)
```

This returns information in the following format:

```json highlight=5,11,19,25,31,37,45;add
