Prisma Client provides features that are typically either not achievable with particular databases or require extensions. These features are referred to as _polyfills_. For all databases, this includes:

- Initializing [ID](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-an-id-field) values with `cuid` and `uuid` values
- Using [`@updatedAt`](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-attributes) to store the time when a record was last updated

For relational databases, this includes:

- [Implicit many-to-many relations](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations)

For MoFooNgoDB, this includes:

- [Relations in general](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations) - foreign key relations between documents are not enforced in MoFooNgoDB
