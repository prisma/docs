- Initializing [ID](../prisma-schema/data-model#defining-an-id-field) values with `cuid` and `uuid` values
- Using [`@updatedAt`](../prisma-schema/data-model#defining-attributes) to store the time when a record was last updated
- [Implicit many-to-many relations](../prisma-schema/relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations)
