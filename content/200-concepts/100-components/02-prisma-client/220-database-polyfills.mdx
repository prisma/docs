Prisma Client provides features that are typically either not achievable with a particular databases or require extensions. These features are referred to as _polyfills_. For all databases, this includes:

- Initializing [ID](../prisma-schema/data-model#defining-an-id-field) values with `cuid` and `uuid` values
- Using [`@updatedAt`](../prisma-schema/data-model#defining-attributes) to store the time when a record was last updated

For relational databases, this includes:

- [Implicit many-to-many relations](../prisma-schema/relations/many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations)

For MongoDB, this includes:

- [Relations in general](../prisma-schema/relations/) - foreign key relations between documents are not enforced in MongoDB
