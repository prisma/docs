You can use the `client` [Prisma Client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) component type to add top-level methods to Prisma Client. We introduced this feature in version 4.7.0.

## Enable the preview feature

Before you create Prisma Client extensions, you must enable the `clientExtensions` feature flag in the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

## Extend Prisma Client

Use the `$extends` [client-level method](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods) to create an _extended client_. An extended client is a variant of the standard Prisma Client that is wrapped by one or more extensions. Use the `client` extension component to add top-level methods to Prisma Client.

To add a top-level method to Prisma Client, use the following structure:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  client?: { ... }
})
```

### Example

The following example uses a `client` extension to start an [interactive transaction](/concepts/components/prisma-client/transactions#interactive-transactions) without callbacks.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  client: {
    begin() { ... }, // define `begin` inside the curly braces
  }
})
```

The following code then starts an interactive transaction without the traditional callback:

```ts

const tx = await xprisma.$begin()

await tx.user.create(...)
await tx.user.update(...)

await tx.$commit()

```
