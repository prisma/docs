From version 4.7.0, you can use Prisma Client extensions to add functionality to your models, result objects, and queries, or to add client-level methods. There are four extension components that you can use to change aspects of the client, as follows:

- `model` extensions: [add custom methods or fields to your models](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/model)
- `client` extensions: [add client-level methods to Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/client)
- `result` extensions: [add custom fields to your query results](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/result)
- `query` extensions: [create custom Prisma Client queries](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/query)

You can combine more than one of these extension components in a single extension. For example, you might create an extension that uses the `model` and `client` extension components.

## About Prisma Client extensions

To use a Prisma Client extension, you must create an associated _extended client_. An extended client is a variant of the standard Prisma Client that is wrapped by one or more extensions. The standard client does not change.

You can run an extension in its own isolated extended client, or combine it with other extensions to wrap an extended client. [Learn more about multiple extensions](#multiple-extensions).

You can [share your Prisma Client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/shared-extensions) with other Prisma users, and [import Prisma Client extensions developed by other users](#install-a-packaged-extension) into your Prisma project.

### Client instances

Extended clients interact with each other, and with the standard client, as follows:

- Each extended client operates independently in an isolated instance.
- Extended clients cannot conflict with each other, or with the standard client.
- All extended clients and the standard client communicate with the same [Prisma query engine](/concepts/components/prisma-engines/query-engine).
- All extended clients and the standard client share the same connection pool.

### Example use cases for extended clients

Because extended clients operate in isolated instances, they are a good way to do the following:

- Implement row-level security (RLS), where each HTTP request has its own client with its own RLS extension, customized with session data. This can keep each user entirely separate, each in a separate client.
- Add a `user.current()` method for the `User` model to get the currently logged-in user.
- Enable more verbose logging for requests if a debug cookie is set.
- Attach a unique request id to all logs so you can correlate them later, for example to help you analyze the operations that Prisma Client carries out.
- Remove a `delete` method from models unless the application calls the admin endpoint and the user has the necessary privileges.

## Prerequisites

Prisma Client extensions are available in Preview from version [4.7.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/4.7.0).

To use Prisma Client extensions, you must enable the `clientExtensions` preview feature flag in the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

## Create an extension

Use the `$extends` [client-level method](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods) to create an extended client. In your `$extends` structure, use the appropriate extension component or components (`model`, `client`, `result` or `query`).

For example, the following code uses a [`model` extension](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/model) to extend the `User` model.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name: `signUp`, // Optional: name appears in error logs
  model: {        // This is a `model` component
    user: { ... } // The extension logic for the `user` model goes inside the curly braces
  },
})
```

## Name an extension for error logs

You can name your extensions to help identify them in error logs. To do so, use the optional field `name`. For example:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name: `signUp`,  // (Optional) Extension name
  model: {
    user: { ... }
 },
})
```

## Multiple extensions

You must run each client extension in one of two ways:

- With its own [extended client](#about-prisma-client-extensions), or
- Combined with other extensions with an extended client. The functionality from these combined extensions applies to the same extended client.
  Note: [Combined extensions can conflict](#conflicts-in-combined-extensions).

You can combine the two approaches above. For example, you might associate one extension with its own extended client and associate two other extensions with another extended client. [Learn more about how client instances interact](#client-instances).

### Apply multiple extensions to an extended client

In the following example, suppose that you have two extensions, `extensionA` and `extensionB`. There are two ways to combine these.

#### Option 1: declare the new client in one line

With this option, you apply both extensions to a new client in one line of code.

```ts
// First of all, store your original Prisma Client in a variable as usual
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// Declare an extended client that has an extensionA and extensionB
const prismaAB = prisma.$extends(extensionA).$extends(extensionB)
```

You can then refer to `prismaAB` in your code, for example `prismaAB.getName()`.

#### Option 2: declare multiple extended clients

The advantage of this option is that you can call any of the extended clients separately.

```ts
// First of all, store your original Prisma Client in a variable as usual
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// Declare an extended client that has extensionA applied
const prismaA = prisma.$extends(extensionA)

// Declare an extended client that has extensionB applied
const prismaB = prisma.$extends(extensionB)

// Declare an extended client that is a combination of clientA and clientB
const prismaAB = prismaA.$extends(extensionB)
```

In your code, you can call any of these clients separately, for example `prismaA.getName()`, `prismaB.getName()`, or `prismaAB.getName()`.

### Conflicts in combined extensions

When you combine two or more extensions into a single extended client, then the _last_ extension that you declare takes precedence in any conflict. In the example in option 1 above, suppose there is a method called `getName()` defined in `extensionA` and a method called `getName()` in `extensionB`. When you call `prismaAB.getName()`, then the client uses `getName()` as defined in `extensionB`.
