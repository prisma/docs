From version 4.7.0, you can use Prisma Client extensions to add functionality to your models, result objects, and queries, or to add client-level methods.

You can create an extension with one or more of the following component types:

- `model`: [add custom methods or fields to your models](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/model)
- `client`: [add client-level methods to Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/client)
- `query`: [create custom Prisma Client queries](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/query)
- `result`: [add custom fields to your query results](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/result)

For example, you might create an extension that uses the `model` and `client` component types.

## About Prisma Client extensions

When you use a Prisma Client extension, you create an _extended client_. An extended client is a lightweight variant of the standard Prisma Client that is wrapped by one or more extensions. The standard client is not mutated. You can add as many extended clients as you want to your project. [Learn more about extended clients](#extended-clients).

You can associate a single extension, or multiple extensions, with an extended client. [Learn more about multiple extensions](#multiple-extensions).

You can [share your Prisma Client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/shared-extensions) with other Prisma users, and [import Prisma Client extensions developed by other users](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/shared-extensions#install-a-packaged-extension) into your Prisma project.

### Extended clients

Extended clients interact with each other, and with the standard client, as follows:

- Each extended client operates independently in an isolated instance.
- Extended clients cannot conflict with each other, or with the standard client.
- All extended clients and the standard client communicate with the same [Prisma query engine](/concepts/components/prisma-engines/query-engine).
- All extended clients and the standard client share the same connection pool.

### Example use cases for extended clients

Because extended clients operate in isolated instances, they can be a good way to do the following, for example:

- Implement row-level security (RLS), where each HTTP request has its own client with its own RLS extension, customized with session data. This can keep each user entirely separate, each in a separate client.
- Add a `user.current()` method for the `User` model to get the currently logged-in user.
- Enable more verbose logging for requests if a debug cookie is set.
- Attach a unique request id to all logs so that you can correlate them later, for example to help you analyze the operations that Prisma Client carries out.
- Remove a `delete` method from models unless the application calls the admin endpoint and the user has the necessary privileges.

## Extensions prerequisites

Prisma Client extensions are available in Preview from version [4.7.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/4.7.0).

To use Prisma Client extensions, you must enable the `clientExtensions` preview feature flag in the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

## Create an extended client

Use the `$extends` [client-level method](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods) to create an extended client. In your `$extends` structure, use the appropriate extension component or components ([`model`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/model), [`client`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/client), [`result`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/result) or [`query`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/query)).

For example, the following code uses a [`model` extension component](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/model) to extend the `User` model.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name: `signUp`, // Optional: name appears in error logs
  model: {        // This is a `model` component
    user: { ... } // The extension logic for the `user` model goes inside the curly braces
  },
})
```

## Name an extension for error logs

You can name your extensions to help identify them in error logs. To do so, use the optional field `name`. For example:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name: `signUp`,  // (Optional) Extension name
  model: {
    user: { ... }
 },
})
```

## Multiple extensions

You can associate an extension with an [extended client](#about-prisma-client-extensions) in one of two ways:

- You can associate it with an extended client on its own, or
- You can combine the extension with other extensions and associate all of these extensions with an extended client. The functionality from these combined extensions applies to the same extended client.
  Note: [Combined extensions can conflict](#conflicts-in-combined-extensions).

You can combine the two approaches above. For example, you might associate one extension with its own extended client and associate two other extensions with another extended client. [Learn more about how client instances interact](#extended-clients).

### Apply multiple extensions to an extended client

In the following example, suppose that you have two extensions, `extensionA` and `extensionB`. There are two ways to combine these.

#### Option 1: Declare the new client in one line

With this option, you apply both extensions to a new client in one line of code.

```ts
// First of all, store your original Prisma Client in a variable as usual
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// Declare an extended client that has an extensionA and extensionB
const prismaAB = prisma.$extends(extensionA).$extends(extensionB)
```

You can then refer to `prismaAB` in your code, for example `prismaAB.myExtensionMethod()`.

#### Option 2: Declare multiple extended clients

The advantage of this option is that you can call any of the extended clients separately.

```ts
// First of all, store your original Prisma Client in a variable as usual
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// Declare an extended client that has extensionA applied
const prismaA = prisma.$extends(extensionA)

// Declare an extended client that has extensionB applied
const prismaB = prisma.$extends(extensionB)

// Declare an extended client that is a combination of clientA and clientB
const prismaAB = prismaA.$extends(extensionB)
```

In your code, you can call any of these clients separately, for example `prismaA.myExtensionMethod()`, `prismaB.myExtensionMethod()`, or `prismaAB.myExtensionMethod()`.

### Conflicts in combined extensions

When you combine two or more extensions into a single extended client, then the _last_ extension that you declare takes precedence in any conflict. In the example in option 1 above, suppose there is a method called `myExtensionMethod()` defined in `extensionA` and a method called `myExtensionMethod()` in `extensionB`. When you call `prismaAB.myExtensionMethod()`, then the client uses `myExtensionMethod()` as defined in `extensionB`.
