You can use the `result` [Prisma Client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) component type to add custom fields and methods to query results. We introduced this feature in version 4.7.0.

## Enable the preview feature

Before you create Prisma Client extensions, you must enable the `clientExtensions` feature flag in the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

## Add custom fields or methods to query results

Use the `$extends` [client-level method](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods) to create an _extended client_. An extended client is a variant of the standard Prisma Client that is wrapped by one or more extensions.

Use the `result` extension component to add custom fields and methods to query results.

To add a custom [field](#add-a-custom-field-to-query-results) or [method](#add-a-custom-method-to-the-result-object) to query results, use the following structure. In this example, we add the custom field `myComputedField` to the result of a `user` model query.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name?: 'name',
  result?: {
    user: {                   // in this case, we extend the `user` model
      myComputedField: {      // the name of the new computed field
        needs: { ... },
        compute() { ... }
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The parameters are as follows:

- `name`: (optional) specifies a name for the extension that appears in error logs.
- `result`: defines new fields and methods to the query results.
- `needs`: an object which describes the dependencies of the result field.
- `compute`: a method that defines how the virtual field is computed when it is accessed.

### Add a custom field to query results

You can use the `result` extension component to add fields to query results. These fields are computed at runtime and are type-safe.

In the following example, we add a new virtual field called `fullName` to the `user` model.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  result: {
    user: {
      fullName: {
        // the dependencies
        needs: { firstName: true, lastName: true },
        compute(user) {
          // the computation logic
          return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
        },
      },
    },
  },
})

const user = await xprisma.user.findFirst()

// return the user's full name, such as "John Doe"
console.log(user.fullName)
```

In above example, the input `user` of `compute` is automatically typed according to the object defined in `needs`. `firstName` and `lastName` are of type `string`, because they are specified in `needs`. If they are not specified in `needs`, then they cannot be accessed.

When you call a method in an extension, use the constant name from your `$extends` statement, not `prisma`. In the above example, `xprisma.user.findFirst` computes the virtual field, but `prisma.user.findFirst` would not.

### Re-use a computed field in another computed field

The following example computes a user's title and full name in a type-safe way. `titleFullName` is a computed field that reuses the `fullName` computed field.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma
  .$extends({
    result: {
      user: {
        fullName: {
          needs: { firstName: true, lastName: true },
          compute(user) {
            return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
          },
        },
      },
    },
  })
  .$extends({
    result: {
      user: {
        titleFullName: {
          needs: { title: true, fullName: true },
          compute(user) {
            return `${user.title} (${user.fullName})`
          },
        },
      },
    },
  })
```

#### Considerations for fields

- For performance reasons, Prisma Client computes results on access, not on retrieval.
- You can only create computed fields that are based on scalar fields.
- You can only use computed fields with `select` and you cannot aggregate them. For example:

  ```ts
  const user = await xprisma.user.findFirst({ select: { email: true }))
  console.log(user.fullName) // undefined
  ```

### Add a custom method to the result object

You can use the `result` component to add methods to query results. The following example adds a new method, `save` to the result object.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  result: {
    user: {
      save: {
        needs: { id: true },
        compute(user) {
          return () =>
            prisma.user.update({ where: { id: user.id }, data: user })
        },
      },
    },
  },
})

const user = await xprisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { id: someId } })
user.email = 'mynewmail@mailservice.com'
await user.save()
```

When you call a method in an extension, use the constant name from your `$extends`statement, not `prisma`. In the above example, `xprisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow` works, but `prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow` does not.
