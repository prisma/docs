## <inlinecode>PrismaClientKnownRequestError</inlinecode>

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` exception if the query engine returns a known error related to the request - for example, a unique constraint violation.

| **Property** | **Description**                                                                                                  |

## <inlinecode>PrismaClientUnknownRequestError</inlinecode>

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientUnknownRequestError` exception if the query engine returns an error related to a request that does not have an error code.

## <inlinecode>PrismaClientRustPanicError</inlinecode>

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientRustPanicError` exception if the underlying engine crashes and exits with a non-zero exit code. In this case, the Prisma Client or the whole Node process must be restarted.

## <inlinecode>PrismaClientInitializationError</inlinecode>

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientInitializationError` exception if something goes wrong when the query engine binary is started. This happens either:

- When `prisma.$connect()` is called OR
- After the first query

Errors that can occur include:

- The port that the query engine HTTP server wants to bind to is already taken
- A missing or inaccessible environment variable
- The query engine binary for the current platform could not be found (`generator` block)

## <inlinecode>PrismaClientValidationError</inlinecode>

Prisma Client throws a `PrismaClientValidationError` exception if validation fails - for example:

- Missing field - for example, an empty `data: {}` property when creating a new record
- Incorrect field type provided (for example, setting a `Boolean` field to `"Hello, I like cheese and gold!"`)
