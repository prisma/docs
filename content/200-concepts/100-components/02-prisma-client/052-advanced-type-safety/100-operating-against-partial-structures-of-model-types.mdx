When using Prisma Client, every model from your [Prisma schema](../../prisma-schema) is translated into a dedicated TypeScript type. For example, assume you have the following `User` and `Post` models:

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int      @id
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  posts     Post[]
}

model Post {
  id         Int        @id
  author     User
  title      String
  published  Boolean    @default(false)
}
```

The Prisma Client code that's generated from this schema contains this representation of the `User` type:

```ts
export declare type User = {
  id: string
  email: string
  name: string | null
}
```

## Problem: Using variations of the generated model type

### Description

In some scenarios, you may need a _variation_ of the generated `User` type. For example, when you have a function that expects an instance of the `User` model that carries the `posts` relation. Or when you need a type to pass only the `User` model's `email` and `name` fields around in your application code.

### Solution

As a solution, you can customize the generated model type using Prisma Client's helper types.

The `User` type only contains the model's [scalar](../../prisma-schema/data-model#scalar-fields) fields, but doesn't account for any relations. That's because [relations are not included by default](../select-fields#return-the-default-selection-set) in Prisma Client queries.

However, sometimes it's useful to have a type available that **includes a relation** (i.e. a type that you'd get from an API call that uses [`include`](../select-fields#include-relations-and-select-relation-fields)). Similarly, another useful scenario could be to have a type available that **includes only a subset of the model's scalar fields** (i.e. a type that you'd get from an API call that uses [`select`](../select-fields#select-specific-fields)).

One way of achieving this would be to define these types manually in your application code:

```ts
// 1: Define a type that includes the relation to `Post`
type UserWithPosts = {
  id: string
  email: string
  name: string | null
  posts: Post[]
}

// 2: Define a type that only contains a subset of the scalar fields
type UserPersonalData = {
  email: string
  name: string | null
}
```

While this is certainly feasible, this approach increases the maintenance burden upon changes to the Prisma schema as you need to manually maintain the types. A cleaner solution to this is to use the `UserGetPayload` type that is generated and exposed by Prisma Client under the `Prisma` namespace in combination with the [`validator`](prisma-validator).

The following example uses the `Prisma.validator` to create two type-safe objects and then uses the `Prisma.UserGetPayload` utility function to create a type that can be used to return all users and their posts.

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

// 1: Define a type that includes the relation to `Post`
const userWithPosts = Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserArgs>()({
  include: { posts: true },
})

// 2: Define a type that only contains a subset of the scalar fields
const userPersonalData = Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserArgs>()({
  select: { email: true, name: true },
})

// 3: This type will include a user and all their posts
type UserWithPosts = Prisma.UserGetPayload<typeof userWithPosts>
```

The main benefits of the latter approach are:

- Cleaner approach as it leverages Prisma Client's generated types
- Reduced maintenance burden and improved type safety when the schema changes

## Problem: Getting access to the return type of a function

### Description

When doing [`select`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#select) <span class="api"></span> or [`include`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#include) <span class="api"></span> operations on your models and returning these variants from a function, it can be difficult to gain access to the return type, e.g:

```ts
// Function definition that returns a partial structure
async function getUsersWithPosts() {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany({ include: { posts: true } })
  return users
}
```

Extracting the type that represents "users with posts" from the above code snippet requires some advanced TypeScript usage:

```ts
// Function definition that returns a partial structure
async function getUsersWithPosts() {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany({ include: { posts: true } })
  return users
}

// Extract `UsersWithPosts` type with
type ThenArg<T> = T extends PromiseLike<infer U> ? U : T
type UsersWithPosts = ThenArg<ReturnType<typeof getUsersWithPosts>>

// run inside `async` function
const usersWithPosts: UsersWithPosts = await getUsersWithPosts()
```

### Solution

With the `PromiseReturnType` that is exposed by Prisma namespace, you can solve this more elegantly:

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

type UsersWithPosts = Prisma.PromiseReturnType<typeof getUsersWithPosts>
```
