<TopBlock>

The generated code for Prisma Client contains several helpful types and utilities that you can use to make your application more type-safe. This page describes patterns for leveraging them.

## Importing generated types

You can import the `Prisma` namespace and use dot notation to access types and utilities. The following example shows how to import the `Prisma` namespace and use it to access and use the `Prisma.UserSelect` [generated type](#what-are-generated-types):

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

// Build 'select' object
const userEmail: Prisma.UserSelect = {
  email: true,
}

// Use select object
const createUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'bob@prisma.io',
  },
  select: userEmail,
})
```

## What are generated types?

Generated types are TypeScript types that are derived from your models. You can use them to create typed objects that you pass into top-level methods like `prisma.user.create(...)` or `prisma.user.update(...)`, or options such as `select` or `include`.

For example, `select` accepts an object of type `UserSelect`. Its object properties match those that are supported by `select` statements according to the model.

The first tab below shows the `UserSelect` generated type and how each property on the object has a type annotation. The second tab shows the resulting schema model.

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Generated type" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="Model" icon="prisma"/>]}>

<tab>

```ts
type Prisma.UserSelect = {
    id?: boolean | undefined;
    email?: boolean | undefined;
    name?: boolean | undefined;
    posts?: boolean | Prisma.PostFindManyArgs | undefined;
    profile?: boolean | Prisma.ProfileArgs | undefined;
}
```

</tab>

<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

In TypeScript the concept of [type annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-annotations-on-variables) is when you declare a variable and add a type annotation to describe the type of the variable. See the below example.

```ts
const myAge: number = 37
const myName: string = 'Rich'
```

Both of these variable declarations have been given a type annotation to specify what primitive type they are, `number` and `string` respectively. Most of the time this kind of annotation is not needed as TypeScript will infer the type of the variable based on how its initialized. In the above example `myAge` was initialized with a number so TypeScript guesses that it should be typed as a number.

Going back to the `UserSelect` type, if you were to use dot notation on the created object `userEmail`, you would have access to all of the fields on the `User` model that can be interacted with using a `select` statement.

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}
```

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const userEmail: Prisma.UserSelect = {
  email: true,
}

// properties available on the typed object
userEmail.id
userEmail.email
userEmail.name
userEmail.posts
userEmail.profile
```

In the same mould, you can type an object with an `include` generated type then your object would have access to those properties on which you can use an `include` statement.

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const userPosts: Prisma.UserInclude = {
  posts: true,
}

// properties available on the typed object
userPosts.posts
userPosts.profile
```

> See the [model query options](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#model-query-options) reference for more information about the different types available.

### Generated <inlinecode>UncheckedInput</inlinecode> types

The `UncheckedInput` types are a special set of generated types that allow you to perform some operations that Prisma Client considers "unsafe", like directly writing [relation scalar fields](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations). You can choose either the "safe" `Input` types or the "unsafe" `UncheckedInput` type when doing operations like `create`, `update`, or `upsert`.

For example, this Prisma schema has a one-to-many relation between `User` and `Post`:

```prisma
model Post {
  id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String  @db.VarChar(255)
  content  String?
  author   User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}
```

The first tab shows the `PostUncheckedCreateInput` generated type. It contains the `authorId` property, which is a relation scalar field. The second tab shows an example query that uses the `PostUncheckedCreateInput` type. This query will result in an error if a user with an `id` of `1` does not exist.

<TabbedContent tabs={[ <FileWithIcon text="Generated type" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="Example query" icon="code"/>]}>

<tab>

```ts
type PostUncheckedCreateInput = {
  id?: number
  title: string
  content?: string | null
  authorId: number
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```ts
prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'First post',
    content: 'Welcome to the first post in my blog...',
    authorId: 1,
  },
})
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

The same query can be rewritten using the "safer" `PostCreateInput` type. This type does not contain the `authorId` field but instead contains the `author` relation field.

<TabbedContent tabs={[ <FileWithIcon text="Generated type" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="Example query" icon="code"/>]}>

<tab>

```ts
type PostCreateInput = {
  title: string
  content?: string | null
  author: UserCreateNestedOneWithoutPostsInput
}

type UserCreateNestedOneWithoutPostsInput = {
  create?: XOR<
    UserCreateWithoutPostsInput,
    UserUncheckedCreateWithoutPostsInput
  >
  connectOrCreate?: UserCreateOrConnectWithoutPostsInput
  connect?: UserWhereUniqueInput
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```ts
prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'First post',
    content: 'Welcome to the first post in my blog...',
    author: {
      connect: {
        id: 1,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

This query will also result in an error if an author with an `id` of `1` does not exist. In this case, Prisma Client will give a more descriptive error message. You can also use the [`connectOrCreate`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#connectorcreate) API to safely create a new user if one does not already exist with the given `id`.

We recommend using the "safe" `Input` types whenever possible.
