The generated code for Prisma Client contains several helpful types and utilities that you can use to make your application more type-safe. This page describes patterns for leveraging them.

</TopBlock>

## Using the <inlinecode>Prisma</inlinecode> namespace

The `Prisma` namespace can be imported and various utilities accessed using dot notation. Generated types are one such utility. The following example shows how to import the `Prisma` namespace and use it to access a [generated type](#what-are-generated-types). This type is then used to create a typed `select` statement which can be used when composing queries.

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const userEmail: Prisma.UserSelect = {
  email: true,
}
```

## What are generated types?

Generated types are TypeScript types that are derived from your models. They allow you to perform operations such as a `select` or `include` on your records in a typed manner.

`UserSelect` is one such generated type. Its object properties match those that are supported by `select` statements according to the model.

The first tab below shows the `UserSelect` generated type and how each property on the object has a type annotation. The second tab shows the resulting schema model.

<tab>

```ts
type Prisma.UserSelect = {
    id?: boolean | undefined;
    email?: boolean | undefined;
    name?: boolean | undefined;
    posts?: boolean | Prisma.PostFindManyArgs | undefined;
    profile?: boolean | Prisma.ProfileArgs | undefined;
}
```

</tab>

<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}
```

</tab>

In TypeScript the concept of [type annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-annotations-on-variables) is when you declare a variable and add a type annotation to describe the type of the variable. See the below example.

```ts
const myAge: number = 37
const myName: string = 'Rich'
```

Both of these variable declarations have been given a type annotation to specify what primitive type they are, `number` and `string` respectively. Most of the time this kind of annotation is not needed as TypeScript will infer the type of the variable based on how its initialized. In the above example `myAge` was initialized with a number so TypeScript guesses that it should be typed as a number.

Going back to the `UserSelect` type, if you were to use dot notation on the created object `userEmail`, you would have access to all of the fields on the `User` model that can be interacted with using a `select` statement.

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}
```

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const userEmail: Prisma.UserSelect = {
  email: true,
}

// properties available on the typed object
userEmail.id
userEmail.email
userEmail.name
userEmail.posts
userEmail.profile
```

In the same mould, you can type an object with an `include` generated type then your object would have access to those properties on which you can use an `include` statement.

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const userInclude: Prisma.UserInclude = {
  posts: true,
}

// properties available on the typed object
userInclude.posts
userInclude.profile
```

> See the [modal query options](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#model-query-options) reference for more information about the different types available.
