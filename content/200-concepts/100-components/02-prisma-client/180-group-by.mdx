<TopBlock>

Prisma Client allows you to group records by one or more field values - such as `country`, or `country` and `city` - and perform aggregations on each group. The following example groups all users by the `country` field and returns the total number of profile views for each country:

<CodeWithResult expanded="{true}">
<Cmd>

```ts
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({    
    by: ["country"],
    sum: {
        profileViews: true
    }
})
```
</Cmd>
<CmdResult>

```js
[
  { country: 'Germany', sum: { profileViews: 126 } },
  { country: 'Sweden', sum: { profileViews: 0 } },
]
```

</CmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

`groupBy` is a preview feature. To enable this feature, add `"groupBy"` to the generator block in your schema as shown and run `prisma generate`:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["groupBy"]
}
```

## <inlinecode>groupBy</inlinecode> and filtering

`groupBy` supports two levels of filtering: `where` and `having`.

### Filter records with `where`

Use `where` to filter all records **before grouping**. The following example groups users by country and sums profile views, but only includes users where the email address contains `prisma.io`:

```ts
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ["country"],
|  where: {
|    email: {
|      contains: "prisma.io"
|    }
|  },
  sum: {
    profileViews: true
  }
})
```

### Filter groups with <inlinecode>having</inlinecode>

Use `having` to filter **entire groups** by an aggregate value such as the sum or average of a field, not individual records - for example, only return groups where the _average_ `profileViews` is greater than 100:

```ts highlight=11-17;normal
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ["country"],
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: "prisma.io"
    }
  },
  sum: {
    profileViews: true
  },
|  having: {
|    profileViews: {
|      avg: {
|        gt: 100
|      }
|    }
|  }
})
```

#### Use case for <inlinecode>having</inlinecode>

The primary use case for `having` is to filter on aggregations. We recommend that you use `where` to reduce the size of your data set as far as possible _before_ grouping, because doing so ✔ reduces the number of records the database has to return and ✔ makes use of indices.

For example, the following query groups all users that are _not_ from Sweden or Ghana:

```ts
const fd = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ["country"],
  where: {
|      country: {
|        notIn: ["Sweden", "Ghana"]
|      }
  },
  sum: {
    profileViews: true
  }
  having: {
    profileViews: {
      min: {
        gte: 10
      }
    }
  }    
})
```

The following query technically achieves the same result, but excludes users from Ghana _after_ grouping. This does not confer any benefit and is not recommended practice.

```ts
const groupUsers = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ["country"],
  where: {
|    country: {
|      not: "Sweden"
|    }
  },
  sum: {
    profileViews: true
  },
  having: {
|    country: {
|      not: "Ghana"
|    }
     profileViews: {
       min: {
        gte: 10
      }
    }
  }
})
```

> **Note**: Within `having`, you can only filter on aggregate values _or_ fields available in `by`.

## <inlinecode>groupBy</inlinecode> and ordering

The following constraints apply when you combine `groupBy` and `orderBy`:

* You can only `orderBy` fields that are present in `by`
* If you use `skip` and/or `take` with `groupBy`, you must also include `orderBy` in the query

The following query orders groups by country, skips the first two groups, and returns the 3rd and 4th group:

```ts
const groupBy = await prisma.user.groupBy({
  by: ["country"],
  sum: {
    profileViews: true
  },
  orderBy: {
    country: "desc"
  },
  skip: 2,
  take: 2
})
```

## Generated types

The following types relating to group by are generated from the `User` model:

```ts
export type GroupByUserArgs = {
  where?: UserWhereInput
  orderBy?: Enumerable<UserOrderByInput>
  by: Array<UserScalarFieldEnum>
  having?: UserScalarWhereWithAggregatesInput
  take?: number
  skip?: number
  count?: UserCountAggregateInputType
  avg?: UserAvgAggregateInputType
  sum?: UserSumAggregateInputType
  min?: UserMinAggregateInputType
  max?: UserMaxAggregateInputType
}
```

## FAQ

### Can I use `select` with `groupBy`?

You cannot use `select` with `groupBy`. However, all fields included in `by` are automatically returned.

### What is the difference between using `where` and `having` with `groupBy`?

`where` filters all records before grouping, and `having` filters entire groups and supports filtering on an aggregate field value, such as the average or sum of a particular field in that group.

### What is the difference between `groupBy` and `distinct`?

Both `distinct` and `groupBy` group records by one or more unique field values. `groupBy` allows you to aggregate data within each group - for example, return the average number of views on posts from Denmark - whereas distinct does not.
