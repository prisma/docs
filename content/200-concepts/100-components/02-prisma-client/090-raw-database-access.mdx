**MongoDB not supported** <br />
Raw queries are currently not supported by the [MongoDB connector](/concepts/database-connectors/mongodb).

</Admonition>

Prisma Client exposes four methods that allow you to send raw SQL queries to your database:

- Use `$queryRaw` to return actual records (for example, using `SELECT`)
- Use `$executeRaw` to return a count of affected rows (for example, after an `UPDATE` or `DELETE`)
- Use `$queryRawUnsafe` to return actual records (for example, using `SELECT`) using a raw string. **Potential SQL injection risk**
- Use `$executeRawUnsafe` to return a count of affected rows (for example, after an `UPDATE` or `DELETE`) using a raw string. **Potential SQL injection risk**

Use cases for raw SQL include:

- You are a strong SQL user and want to run a heavily optimized query
- Prisma Client does not yet support the feature that you require (please [consider raising an issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/new/choose))

</TopBlock>

## <inlinecode>$queryRaw</inlinecode>

`$queryRaw` returns actual database records. For example, the following `SELECT` query returns all fields for each record in the `User` table:

```ts no-lines
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User`
```

The method is implemented as a [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates), which makes it easier to use [variables](#using-variables) by providing **placeholders**. The following example includes an `${email}` placeholder:

```ts no-lines
const email = 'emelie@prisma.io'
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE email = ${email}`
```

You can also use the [`Prisma.sql`](#tagged-template-helpers) helper, in fact, the `$queryRaw` method will **only accept** a template string or the `Prisma.sql` helper.

```ts no-lines
const email = 'emelie@prisma.io'
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw(
  Prisma.sql`SELECT * FROM User WHERE email = ${email}`
)
```

### Return type

`$queryRaw` returns an array. Each object corresponds to a database record:

```json5
[
  { id: 1, email: 'emelie@prisma.io', name: 'Emelie' },
  { id: 2, email: 'yin@prisma.io', name: 'Yin' },
]
```

You can also [type the results of `$queryRaw`](#typing-queryraw-results).

### Signature

```ts no-lines
$queryRaw<T = unknown>(query: TemplateStringsArray | Prisma.Sql, ...values: any[]): PrismaPromise<T>;
```

### Typing `$queryRaw` results

You can adjust the return type of `$queryRaw` with a [TypeScript Generic](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html). `$queryRaw` has the following signature:

```ts no-lines
$queryRaw<T = unknown>(query: TemplateStringsArray | Prisma.Sql, ...values: any[]): PrismaPromise<T>;
```

`PrismaPromise<T>` uses a [generic type parameter `T`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html). You can determine the type of `T` when you invoke the `$queryRaw` method. In the following example, `$queryRaw` returns `User[]`:

```ts
// import the generated `User` type from the `@prisma/client` module
import { User } from '@prisma/client'

const result = await prisma.$queryRaw<User[]>`SELECT * FROM User`
// result is of type: `User[]`
```

> **Note**: If you do not provide a type, `$queryRaw` defaults to `unknown`.

<!-- ![Typing $queryRaw results](https://res.cloudinary.com/prismaio/image/upload/v1628761155/docs/H2TCRc5.png) -->

If you are selecting **specific fields** of the model or want to include relations, refer to the documentation about [leveraging Prisma Client's generated types](advanced-type-safety) if you want to make sure that the results are properly typed.

#### Type caveats when using raw SQL

When you type the results of `$queryRaw`, the raw data does not always match the suggested TypeScript type. For example, the following Prisma model includes a `Boolean` field named `published`:

```prisma highlight=3;normal
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  published Boolean @default(false)
  title     String
  content   String?
}
```

The following query returns all posts and prints out the value of `published` field of each `Post`:

```ts
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw<Post[]>`SELECT * FROM Post`

result.forEach((x) => {
  console.log(x.published)
})
```

If the database provider is MySQL, the values are `1` or `0`. However, if the database provider is PostgreSQL, the values are `true`, `false`, or `NULL`.

> **Note**: The Prisma Client query engine standardizes the return type for all databases. **Using the raw queries does not**.

## <inlinecode>$queryRawUnsafe</inlinecode>

The `$queryRawUnsafe` method allows you to pass a raw string (or template string) to the database.

<Admonition type="warning">

By using this method you open up the possibility for SQL injection attacks. SQL injection attacks can expose your data, be it confidential or otherwise sensitive, to being modified, or even destroyed.

We strongly advise that you use the `$queryRaw` query instead. For more information on SQL injection attacks, see the [OWASP SQL Injection guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection).

</Admonition>

The following query returns all fields for each record in the `User` table:

```ts
// import the generated `User` type from the `@prisma/client` module
import { User } from '@prisma/client'

const result = await prisma.$queryRawUnsafe(`SELECT * FROM User`)
```

You can also run a parameterized query. The following example returns all users whose email contains the string `emelie@prisma.io`:

```ts
prisma.$queryRawUnsafe(
  'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1',
  'emelie@prisma.io'
)
```

### Signature

```ts no-lines
$queryRawUnsafe<T = unknown>(query: string, ...values: any[]): PrismaPromise<T>;
```

### Parameterized queries

As an alternative to tagged templates, `$queryRawUnsafe` supports standard parameterized queries where each variable is represented by a symbol (`?` for mySQL, `$1`, `$2`, and so on for PostgreSQL). The following example uses a MySQL query:

```ts
const userName = 'Sarah'
const email = 'sarah@prisma.io'
const result = await prisma.$queryRawUnsafe(
  `SELECT * FROM User WHERE (name = ? OR email = ?)`,
  userName,
  email
)
```

> **Note**: MySQL variables are represented by ?

The following example uses a PostgreSQL query:

```ts
const userName = 'Sarah'
const email = 'sarah@prisma.io'
const result = await prisma.$queryRawUnsafe(
  `SELECT * FROM User WHERE (name = $1 OR email = $2)`,
  userName,
  email
)
```

> **Note**: PostgreSQL variables are represented by $1 and $2

As with tagged templates, Prisma Client escapes all variables.

> **Note**: You cannot pass a table or column name as a variable into a parameterized query. For example, you cannot `SELECT ?` and pass in `*` or `id, name` based on some condition.

#### Parameterized PostgreSQL `ILIKE` query

When you use `ILIKE`, the `%` wildcard character(s) should be included in the variable itself, not the query (`string`):

```ts
const userName = 'Sarah'
const emailFragment = 'prisma.io'
const result = await prisma.$queryRawUnsafe(
  `SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE (name = $1 OR email = $2)`,
  userName,
  `%${emailFragment}`
)
```

> **Note**: Using %$2 as an argument would not work

## <inlinecode>$executeRaw</inlinecode>

`$executeRaw` returns the _number of rows affected by a database operation_, such as `UPDATE` or `DELETE`. This function does **not** return database records. The following query updates records in the database and returns a count of the number of records that were updated:

```ts
const result: number = await prisma.$executeRaw'UPDATE User SET active = true WHERE emailValidated = true'
```

The method is implemented as a [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates), which makes it easier to use [variables](#using-variables) by providing placeholders. The following example includes `${emailValidated}` and `${active}` placeholders:

```ts
const emailValidated = true
const active = true

const result: number =
  await prisma.$executeRaw`UPDATE User SET active = ${active} WHERE emailValidated = ${emailValidated};`
```

Be aware that:

- `$executeRaw` does not support multiple queries in a single string (for example, `ALTER TABLE` and `CREATE TABLE` together).
- Prisma Client submits prepared statements, and prepared statements only allow a subset of SQL statements. For example, `START TRANSACTION` is not permitted. You can learn more about [the syntax that MySQL allows in Prepared Statements here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-prepared-statements.html).
- [`PREPARE` does not support `ALTER`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) - see [workaround](#alter-limitation-postgresql).

### Return type

`$executeRaw` returns a `number`.

### Signature

```ts
$executeRaw<T = unknown>(query: TemplateStringsArray | Prisma.Sql, ...values: any[]): PrismaPromise<number>;
```

## <inlinecode>$executeRawUnsafe</inlinecode>

The `$executeRawUnsafe` method allows you to pass a raw string (or template string) to the database. Like `$executeRaw`, it does **not** return database records, but returns the number of rows affected.

> **Note**: `$executeRawUnsafe` can only run **one** query at a time. You cannot append a second query - for example, adding `DROP bobby_tables` to the end of an `ALTER`.

<Admonition type="warning">

By using this method you open up the possibility for SQL injection attacks. SQL injection attacks can expose your data, be it confidential or otherwise sensitive, to being modified, or even destroyed.

We strongly advise that you use the `$executeRaw` query instead. For more information on SQL injection attacks, see the [OWASP SQL Injection guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection).

</Admonition>

The following example uses a template string to update records in the database. It then returns a count of the number of records that were updated:

```ts
const emailValidated = true
const active = true

const result = await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(
  `UPDATE User SET active = ${active} WHERE emailValidated = ${emailValidated}`
)
```

The same can be written as a parameterized query:

```ts
const result = prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(
  'UPDATE User SET active = $1 WHERE emailValidated = $2',
  'yin@prisma.io',
  true
)
```

### Signature

```ts no-lines
$executeRawUnsafe<T = unknown>(query: string, ...values: any[]): PrismaPromise<number>;
```

## Transactions

In 2.10.0 and later, you can use `.$executeRaw()` and `.$queryRaw()` inside a [transaction](transactions).

## Using variables

`$executeRaw` and `$queryRaw` are implemented as [**tagged templates**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates). Tagged templates are the recommended way to use variables with raw SQL in Prisma Client.

The following example includes a placeholder named `${userId}`. Note the double backticks (` `` `) instead of `()`:

```ts
const userId = 42
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ${userId};`
```

> **Important**: You _must_ use double backticks - the same query using `$queryRaw()` is not secure because `${userId}` is not escaped.

✔ Benefits of using the tagged template versions of `$queryRaw` and `$executeRaw` include:

- Prisma Client escapes all variables.
- Tagged templates are database-agnostic - you do not need to remember if variables should be written as `$1` (PostgreSQL) or `?` (MySQL).
- [SQL Template Tag](https://github.com/blakeembrey/sql-template-tag) give you access to [useful helpers](#tagged-template-helpers).
- Embedded, named variables are easier to read.

> **Note**: You cannot pass a table or column name into a tagged template placeholder. For example, you cannot `SELECT ?` and pass in `*` or `id, name` based on some condition.

### Tagged template helpers

Prisma Client specifically uses [SQL Template Tag](https://github.com/blakeembrey/sql-template-tag), which exposes a number of helpers. For example, the following query uses `join()` to pass in a list of IDs:

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const ids = [1, 3, 5, 10, 20]
const result =
  await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE id IN (${Prisma.join(ids)})`
```

The following example uses the `empty` and `sql` helpers to change the query depending on whether `userName` is empty:

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const userName = ''
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User ${
  userName ? Prisma.sql`WHERE name = ${userName}` : Prisma.empty // Cannot use "" or NULL here!
}`
```

#### <inlinecode>ALTER</inlinecode> limitation (PostgreSQL)

PostgreSQL [does not support using `ALTER` in a prepared statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html), which means that the following queries will not work:

```ts
await prisma.$executeRaw`ALTER USER prisma WITH PASSWORD '${password}'` // Tagged template
await prisma.$executeRaw`ALTER USER prisma WITH PASSWORD $1, newPassword` // Parameterized query
```

You can use the following query, but be aware that this is potentially **unsafe** as `${password}` is not escaped:

```ts
await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe`ALTER USER prisma WITH PASSWORD '${password}'`
```

## SQL injection

Prisma Client mitigates the risk of SQL injection in the following ways:

- Prisma Client escapes all variables when you use tagged templates and sends all queries as prepared statements.

  ```ts
  $queryRaw`` // Tagged template
  $executeRaw`` // Tagged template
  ```

- `$executeRaw` can only run **one** query at a time. You cannot append a second query - for example, adding `DROP bobby_tables` to the end of an `ALTER`.

If you cannot use tagged templates, you can instead use [`$queryRawUnsafe`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/raw-database-access#queryrawunsafe) or [`$executeRawUnsafe`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/raw-database-access#executerawunsafe) but **be aware that your code may be vulnerable to SQL injection**.

### Warning: String concatenation

The following example concatenates `query` and `inputString`. Prisma Client ❌ **cannot** escape `inputString` in this example, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection:

```ts
const inputString = '"Sarah" UNION SELECT id, title, content FROM Post' // SQL Injection
const query = 'SELECT id, name, email FROM User WHERE name = ' + inputString
const result = await prisma.$queryRawUnsafe(query)

console.log(result)
```
