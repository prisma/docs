Raw queries are currently not supported by the [MongoDB connector](../../database-connectors/mongodb).

</Admonition>

Prisma Client exposes two methods that allow you to send raw SQL queries to your database:

- Use `$queryRaw` to return actual records (for example, using `SELECT`)
- Use `$executeRaw` to return a count of affected rows (for example, after an `UPDATE` or `DELETE`)

Use cases for raw SQL include:

- You are a strong SQL user and want to run a heavily optimized query
- Prisma Client does not yet support the feature that you require (please [consider raising an issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/new/choose))

</TopBlock>

## <inlinecode>$queryRaw</inlinecode>

`$queryRaw` returns actual database records. For example, the following `SELECT` query returns all fields for each record in the `User` table:

```ts no-lines
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw('SELECT * FROM User;')
```

The same method is implemented as a [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates), which makes it easier to use [variables](#using-variables) by providing **placeholders**. The following example includes an `${email}` placeholder:

```ts no-lines
const email = 'edna@prisma.io'
const result =
  await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE email = ${email};`
```

### Return type

`$queryRaw` returns an array. Each object corresponds to a database record:

```json5
[
  { id: 1, email: 'sarah@prisma.io', name: 'Sarah' },
  { id: 2, email: 'alice@prisma.io', name: 'Alice' },
]
```

You can also [type the results of `$queryRaw`](#typing-queryraw-results).

### Signature

```ts no-lines
$queryRaw<T = any>(query: string | TemplateStringsArray, ...values: any[]): Promise<T>;
```

### Typing `$queryRaw` results

You can adjust the return type of `$queryRaw` with a [TypeScript Generic](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html). `$queryRaw` has the following signature:

```ts no-lines
$queryRaw<T = any>(query: string | TemplateStringsArray): Promise<T>;
```

`Promise<T>` uses [generic type parameter `T`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html). You can determine the type of `T` when you invoke the `$queryRaw` command. In the following example, `$queryRaw` returns `User[]`:

```ts
// import the generated `User` type from the `@prisma/client` module
import { User } from '@prisma/client'

const result = await prisma.$queryRaw<User[]>('SELECT * FROM User;')
// result is of type: `User[]`
```

> **Note**: If you do not provide a type, `$queryRaw` defaults to `any`.

`result` is now `User[]` and intellisense is available:

If you are selecting **specific fields** of the model or want to include relations, refer to the documentation about [leveraging Prisma Client's generated types](advanced-type-safety) if you want to make sure that the results are properly typed.

#### Type caveats when using raw SQL

When you type the results of `$queryRaw`, the raw data does not always match the suggested TypeScript type. For example, the following Prisma model includes a `Boolean` field named `published`:

```prisma
model Post {
  id         Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
|  published  Boolean @default(false)
  title      String
  content    String?
}
```

The following query returns all posts and prints out the value of `published` field of each `Post`:

```ts
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw<Post[]>`SELECT * FROM Post`

result.forEach((x) => {
  console.log(x.published)
})
```

If the database provider is MySQL, the values are `1` or `0`. However, if the database provider is PostgreSQL, the values are `true`, `false`, or `NULL`.

> **Note**: The Prisma Client query engine standardizes the return type for all databases. Using the raw queries does not.

## <inlinecode>$executeRaw</inlinecode>

`$executeRaw` returns the _number of rows affected by a database operation_, such as `UPDATE` or `DELETE`. This function does **not** return database records. The following query updates records in the database and returns a count of the number of records that were updated:

```ts
const result: number = await prisma.$executeRaw(
  'UPDATE User SET active = true WHERE emailValidated = true;'
)
```

The same method is implemented as a [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates), which makes it easier to use [variables](#using-variables) by providing placeholders. The following example includes `${emailValidated}` and `${active}` placeholders:

```ts
const emailValidated = true
const active = true

const result: number =
  await prisma.$executeRaw`UPDATE User SET active = ${active} WHERE emailValidated = ${emailValidated};`
```

Be aware that:

- `$executeRaw` does not support multiple queries in a single string (for example, `ALTER TABLE` and `CREATE TABLE` together).
- Prisma Client submits prepared statements, and prepared statements only allow a subset of SQL statements (`START TRANSACTION`is not permitted). For example, ["MySQL: SQL Syntax Allowed in Prepared Statements"](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-prepared-statements.html).
- [`PREPARE` does not support `ALTER`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) - see [workaround](#alter-limitation-postgresql).

### Return type

`$executeRaw` returns a `number`.

### Signature

```ts
$executeRaw<T = any>(query: string | TemplateStringsArray, ...values: any[]): Promise<number>;
```

## Transactions

In 2.10.0 and later, you can use `.$executeRaw()` and `.$queryRaw()` inside a [transaction](transactions).

## Using variables

`$executeRaw` and `$queryRaw` are implemented as [**tagged templates**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates). Tagged templates are the recommended way to use variables with raw SQL in Prisma Client.

The following example includes a placeholder named `${userId}`. Note the double backticks (` `` `) instead of `()`:

```ts
const userId = 42
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ${userId};`
```

> **Important**: You _must_ use double backticks - the same query using `$queryRaw()` is not secure because `${userId}` is not escaped.

✔ Benefits of using the tagged template versions of `$queryRaw` and `$executeRaw` include:

- Prisma Client escapes all variables.
- Tagged templates are database-agnostic - you do not need to remember if variables should be written as `$1` (PostgreSQL) or `?` (MySQL).
- [SQL Template Tag](https://github.com/blakeembrey/sql-template-tag) give you access to [useful helpers](#tagged-template-helpers).
- Embedded, named variables are easier to read.

> **Note**: You cannot pass a table or column name into a tagged template placeholder. For example, you cannot `SELECT ?` and pass in `*` or `id, name` based on some condition.

### Tagged template helpers

Prisma Client specifically uses [SQL Template Tag](https://github.com/blakeembrey/sql-template-tag), which exposes a number of helpers. For example, the following query uses `join()` to pass in a list of IDs:

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const ids = [1, 3, 5, 10, 20]
const result =
  await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE id IN (${Prisma.join(ids)})`
```

The following example uses the `empty` and `sql` helpers to change the query depending on whether `userName` is empty:

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const userName = ''
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User ${
  userName ? Prisma.sql`WHERE name = ${userName}` : Prisma.empty // Cannot use "" or NULL here!
}`
```

### Parameterized queries

As an alternative to tagged templates, `$queryRaw()` and `$executeRaw()` support standard parameterized queries where each variable is represented by a symbol (`?` for mySQL, `$1`, `$2`, and so on for PostgreSQL). The following example uses a MySQL query:

```ts
const userName = 'Sarah'
const email = 'alice@prisma.io'
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw(
  'SELECT * FROM User WHERE (name = ? OR email = ?)', // MySQL variables, represented by ?
  userName,
  email
)
```

The following example uses a PostgreSQL query:

```ts
const userName = 'Sarah'
const email = 'alice@prisma.io'
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw(
  'SELECT * FROM User WHERE (name = $1 OR email = $2)', // PostgreSQL variables, represented by $1 and $2
  userName,
  email
)
```

As with tagged templates, Prisma Client escapes all variables.

> **Note**: You cannot pass a table or column name as a variable into a parameterized query. For example, you cannot `SELECT ?` and pass in `*` or `id, name` based on some condition.

#### Parameterized PostgreSQL `ILIKE` query

When you use `ILIKE`, the `%` wildcard character(s) should be included in the variable itself, not the query (`string`):

```ts
const userName = 'Sarah'
const emailFragment = 'prisma.io'
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw(
  'SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE (name = $1 OR email = $2)', // Using %$2 here would not work
  userName,
  `%${emailFragment}`
)
```

#### <inlinecode>ALTER</inlinecode> limitation (PostgreSQL)

PostgreSQL [does not support using `ALTER` in a prepared statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html), which means that the following queries will not work:

```ts
await prisma.$executeRaw`ALTER USER prisma WITH PASSWORD '${password}'` // Tagged template
await prisma.$executeRaw(`ALTER USER prisma WITH PASSWORD $1`, newPassword) // Parameterized query
```

You can use the following query to [work around the issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js/issues/940#issuecomment-748014175), but be aware that this is potentially **unsafe** as `${password}` is not escaped:

```ts
await prisma.$executeRaw(`ALTER USER prisma WITH PASSWORD '${password}'`)
```

## SQL injection

Prisma Client mitigates the risk of SQL injection in the following ways:

- Prisma Client escapes all variables when you use tagged templates (` $queryRaw`` ` or ` $executeRaw`` ` ) or parameterized queries (`$queryRaw(query, variables)` or `$executeRaw(query, variables)`), and sends all queries as prepared statements.
- Both versions of `$executeRaw` (standard and tagged template) can only run **one** query at a time. You cannot append a second query - for example, adding `DROP bobby_tables` to the end of an `ALTER`.

If you cannot use tagged templates or parameterized queries (for example, you need to pass in table or column names as variables), be aware that your code may be vulnerable to SQL injection.

### Warning: String concatenation

The following example concatenates `query` and `inputString`. Prisma Client ❌ **cannot** escape `inputString` in this example, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection:

```ts
const inputString = '"Sarah" UNION SELECT id, title, content FROM Post' // SQL Injection
const query = 'SELECT id, name, email FROM User WHERE name = ' + inputString
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw(query)

console.log(result)
```

### Warning: Template literals

The following example uses a template literal inside `$queryRaw()` and returns all users where `name` equals `${inputString}`. Prisma Client ❌ **cannot** escape `inputString` in this example, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection:

```ts
const inputString = '"Sarah" UNION SELECT id, title, content FROM Post' // SQL Injection
const result = await prisma.$queryRaw(
  `SELECT id, name, email FROM User WHERE name = ${inputString}`
)

console.log(result)
```

By contrast, the same query using **tagged templates** escapes `inputString` and the query does not return results. The only difference between the two examples is that `()` have been replaced by ` `` `:

```ts
const inputString = '"Sarah" UNION SELECT id, title, content FROM Post'
const result =
  await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT id, name, email FROM User WHERE name = ${inputString}`

console.log(result)
```
