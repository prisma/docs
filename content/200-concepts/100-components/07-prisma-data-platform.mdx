The [Prisma Data Platform](https://cloud.prisma.io/) (Early Access) helps developers collaborate better in projects that are using the open-source tools. One of its main features today is an [online data browser](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-online-data-browser-ejgg5c8p3u4x).

You can access it from [cloud.prisma.io](https://cloud.prisma.io).

## Current Functionality

In the current version of the platform, you can:

- Import your existing Prisma project
- Browse your data
- View your Prisma schema
- Invite users

## User Roles

These are the currently supported roles in the Platform:

- **Admin**: Can do all possible actions, such as configuring project settings and viewing/editing data
- **Developer**: Access the data browser, view and edit data and view the schema
- **Collaborator**: Access the data browser and view and edit data
- **Viewer**: Access the data browser and view data

In order to add users, you need to use their GitHub username and they need to have an account in the Platform.

## Static IP for usage in allowlists

The Prisma Data Platform can have a static IP which you can add to an allowlist in order to connect to your database through our Data Browser.

You can [create an issue](https://github.com/prisma/studio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=topic%3A+hosted+data+browser&template=hosted-data-browser-bug-report.md&title=) with your request and we will enable it for you. Please note that while this is a feature that will be part of a paid plan in the future, it is currently offered for free while we are in Early Access.
