The Prisma Data Platform (Early Access) aims to bring developers, data owners, and infrastructure teams together on an platform that liberates access to data, and enables teams to take applications from prototype to billion-users scale without compromise on productivity, security, or compliance.

The product is in its infancy and we are constantly adding capabilities, such as an [online data browser](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-online-data-browser-ejgg5c8p3u4x) and faster ways to get started with Prisma.

You can access it from [cloud.prisma.io](https://cloud.prisma.io).

## Current Functionality

In the current version of the platform, you can:

- Import your existing Prisma Project.
- Browse its data.
- View your Prisma schema.
- Invite users.

## User Roles

These are the currently supported roles in the Platform:

- **Admin**: Can do all possible actions, e.g. configuring project settings and viewing/editing data.
- **Developer**: Access the data browser, view and edit data and view the schema.
- **Collaborator**: Access the data browser and view and edit data.
- **Viewer**: Access the data browser and view data.

In order to add users, you need to use their github username and they need to have an account in the Platform.

## Static IP for whitelisting

The Prisma Data Platform can have a static IP which you can use to whitelist in order to connect to your Database through our Data Browser.

You can [create an issue](https://github.com/prisma/studio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=topic%3A+hosted+data+browser&template=hosted-data-browser-bug-report.md&title=) with your request and we will enable it for you. Please note that while this is a feature that will be part of a paid plan in the future, it is currently offered for free while we are in Early Access.
