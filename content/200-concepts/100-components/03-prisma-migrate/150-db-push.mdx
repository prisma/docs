[`db push`]() <span class="api"></span> uses the same engine as Prisma Migrate, and allows you to synchronize your Prisma schema and database schema. `db push` works in the following way:

1. `db push` introspects the database, and infers and executes the changes required to make your database schema reflect the state of your Prisma schema.
2. By default, after changes have been applied to the database schema, generators are triggered (for example, Prisma Client). You do not need to manually invoke `prisma generate`.
2. If `db push` anticipates that the changes could result in data loss, it will:

    - Throw an error
    - Require the `--accept-data-loss` option if you still want to make the changes

> **Note**: `db push` does not interact with or rely on migrations. The migrations table will no be updated, and no migration files will be generated.

## Choosing <inlinecode>db push</inlinecode> or Prisma Migrate

`db push` is well suited for prototyping, and works well if:

-   You want to **quickly prototype and iterate** on schema design locally without the need to deploy these changes to other environments such as other developers, or staging and production environments.
-   You are prioritizing reaching a **desired end-state** and not the changes or steps executed to reach that end-state (there is no way to preview changes made by `db push`)
-   You do not need to control how schema changes impact data. There is no way to orchestrate schema and data migrations - if `db push` anticipates that changes will result in data loss, you can either accept data loss with the `--accept-data-loss` option or stop the process - there is no way to customize the changes.

See [Schema prototyping with `db push`](../../../guides/application-lifecycle/prototyping-schema-db-push) <span class="guide"></span> for an example of how to use `db push` in this way.

`db push` is **not recommended** if:

-   You want to replicate your schema changes in other environments without losing data. You can use `db push` for prototyping, but you should use migrations to commit the schema changes and apply these in your other environments.
-   You want fine-grained control over how the schema changes are executed - for example, [renaming a column instead of dropping it and creating a new one](../../../guides/application-lifecycle/developing-with-prisma-migrate/advanced-migrate-scenarios#renaming-a-field).
-   You want to keep track of changes made to the database schema over time. `db push` does not create any artifacts that allow you to keep track of these changes.
-   You want the schema changes to be reversible. You can use `db push` again to revert to the original state, but this might result in data loss.
