Prisma Migrate is an imperative database schema migration tool that enables you to make changes to your database schema. Migrations are auto-generated based on schema changes but are fully customizable. A simple Prisma Migrate workflow includes:

1. Detecting changes in your [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema), which is the source of truth for your data model
2. Generating `.sql` migration files with changes (which you can optionally modify)
3. Applying the migration files to your database

Prisma Migrate was introduced as a Preview feature in [2.13.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.13.0) and replaces [legacy Prisma Migrate](legacy-migrate).

## Basic example

The following example demonstrates how to get started with Prisma Migrate:

1. Create a Prisma schema:

   ```prisma file=schema.prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }

   model User {
     id    Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     name  String
     posts Post[]
   }

   model Post {
     id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
     title     String
     published Boolean @default(true)
     authorId  Int
     author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
   }
   ```

1. Migrate your schema - you will be prompted to name the migration file (for example, `first_migration`):

  <CodeWithResult>

  <Cmd>

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
    ```

  </Cmd>

  <CmdResult>

    ```
    √ Name of migration ... first-migration

    Prisma Migrate created and applied the following migration(s) from new schema changes:

    migrations/
    └─ 20201127130602_first_migration/
      └─ migration.sql

    ✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.13.0-dev.3) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 146ms

    Everything is now in sync.
    ```

  </CmdResult>

  </CodeWithResult>
  
    Prisma Migrate creates a `migration.sql` file with the following SQL and runs it against your database:

    ```sql
      -- CreateTable
    CREATE TABLE "User" (
    "id" SERIAL,
        "name" TEXT NOT NULL,

        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
    );
      -- CreateTable
    CREATE TABLE "Post" (
    "id" SERIAL,
        "title" TEXT NOT NULL,
        "published" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
        "authorId" INTEGER NOT NULL,

        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
    );

      -- AddForeignKey
    ALTER TABLE "Post" ADD FOREIGN KEY("authorId")REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;
    ```

    After your first migration, your Prisma Schema and database are now in sync.

1. Change the schema by adding two new fields:

   - One optional field (`bio`)
   - One mandatory field with a default value (`jobTitle`)

   ```prisma file=schema.prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }

   model User {
     id    Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     name  String
   |  bio   String?
     posts Post[]
   |  jobTitle  String  @default("Blogger")
   }

   model Post {
     id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
     title     String
     published Boolean @default(true)
     authorId  Int
     author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
   }
   ```

1. Migrate your schema again:

  <CodeWithResult>

  <Cmd>

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
    ```

  </Cmd>

  <CmdResult>

    ```
    √ Name of migration ... added_bio_jobTitle
    Prisma Migrate created and applied the following migration(s) from new schema changes:

    migrations/
      └─ 20201127133437_added_bio_job_title/
        └─ migration.sql

    ✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.13.0-dev.3) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 118ms

    Everything is now in sync.
    ```

  </CmdResult>

  </CodeWithResult>

    Prisma Migrate creates a second `migration.sql` file with the following contents and runs it against your database:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN     "bio" TEXT,
    ADD COLUMN     "jobTitle" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Blogger';
    ```

    Your Prisma Schema and database are now in sync again.

1. Push the schema and the `prisma/migrations` folder to a shared repository - your team can now re-play the changes you made on their local database and contribute their own migrations:

  <CodeWithResult>

  <Cmd>

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
    ```

  </Cmd>

  <CmdResult>

    ```
    Prisma Migrate applied the following unapplied migration(s):

    migrations/
      └─ 20201127130602_first_migration/
        └─ migration.sql
      └─ 20201127133437_added_bio_job_title/
        └─ migration.sql

    ✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.13.0-dev.3) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 107ms

    Everything is now in sync.
    ```

  </CmdResult>

  </CodeWithResult>

This example shows a 'happy path' without any complicating factors such as a populated database. For more advanced examples, see [Prisma Migrate flows](prisma-migrate-flows).

### Shadow database

Prisma Migrate uses a second, _temporary_ database when you run development-focused commands such as `prisma migrate dev --preview-feature` and `prisma migrate reset --preview-feature`.
The shadow database is created and deleted each time you run a command, and is used for tasks such as:

- When creating a new migration: replaying the migration history to obtain the final database schema through introspection and create the SQL migrations
- Detecting drift

> **Note**: The shadow database is **not** required for production-focused commands: `prisma migrate resolve --preview-feature` and `prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature`.

#### Shadow database user permissions

In order to create and delete the shadow database when using development commands such as `migrate dev` and `migrate reset`, Prisma Migrate currently requires that the database user defined in your `datasource` has permission to **create databases**.

| Database   | Database user requirements                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLite     | No special requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| MySQL      | Database user must have `CREATE, ALTER, DROP, REFERENCES ON *.*` privileges                                                                                                                                                                       |
| PostgreSQL | The user must be a super user or have `CREATEDB` privilege. See `CREATE ROLE` ([PostgreSQL official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createdatabase.html))                                       |
| SQL Server | The user must be a site admin or have the `SERVER` securable. See the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/permissions-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver15). |

> If you use a cloud-hosted database for development, see: [Cloud-hosted shadow databases](#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases)

Prisma Migrate throws the following error if it cannot create the shadow database with the credentials your connection string supplied:

```
Error: A migration failed when applied to the shadow database
Database error: Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: permission denied to create database
```

The resolve this error:

- If you are working locally, we recommend that you change the database user's privileges.
- If you are developing against a cloud-based database (for example, on Heroku), we recommend that you change to a local web environment (such as running your development database on Docker) for the time being and follow the discussions on [GitHub issue #4571](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4571).
- If you are developing against a cloud-based database (for example, on Heroku) and **cannot** switch, please remain on version 2.12.0 and follow the discussions on [GitHub issue #4571](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4571).
- If you are developing against a cloud-based database (for example, on Heroku) and are currently **prototyping** such that you don't care about generated migration files and only need to apply your Prisma data model to the database schema, you can run [`prisma db push`](../../../reference/api-reference/command-reference#db) instead of the `prisma migrate dev` command.

> **Important**: The shadow database is _only_ required in a development environment (specifically for the `prisma migrate dev --preview-feature` command) - you **do not** need to make any changes to your production environment.

#### Cloud-hosted shadow databases

Cloud providers do not generally allow you to drop and create databases. If you develop in a cloud-hosted environment:

1. Create a dedicated cloud-hosted shadow database
2. Add the URL to the [`shadowDatabaseUrl`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) <span class="api"></span> field:

```prisma highlight=4;normal
datasource db {
  provider          = "postgresql"
  url               = env("DATABASE_URL")
  shadowDatabaseUrl = env("SHADOW_DATABASE_URL")
}
```

## Native types attributes

In [2.17.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/2.17.0) and later, you can use Prisma Migrate and [native database type attributes](../prisma-schema/data-model#native-type-mapping) together. Native database type attributes allow you to specify which _specific_ native type should be created in the database.

> See [type mappings](#type-mappings) for a complete list of supported native types for each Prisma type.

In the following example, the `name` and `title` fields have a `@VarChar(X)` type attribute:

```prisma highlight=8,14;normal
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id    Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String   @db.VarChar(200)
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String   @db.VarChar(150)
  published Boolean @default(true)
  authorId  Int
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
```

Prisma Migrate uses the specified types when it creates a migration:

```sql highlight=4,11;normal
  -- CreateTable
CREATE TABLE "User" (
"id" SERIAL,
    "name" VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
  -- CreateTable
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
"id" SERIAL,
    "title" VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    "published" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    "authorId" INTEGER NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

  -- AddForeignKey
ALTER TABLE "Post" ADD FOREIGN KEY("authorId")REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

## Type mappings

### Mappings by Prisma type

For type mappings organized by Prisma type, refer to the [Prisma schema reference](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#model-field-scalar-types) documentation.

### Mappings by database provider

For type mappings organized by database provider, see:

- [PostgreSQL mappings](../../database-connectors/postgresql#prisma-migrate)
- [MySQL mappings](../../database-connectors/mysql#prisma-migrate)
- [SQL Server mappings](../preview-features/sql-server#type-mapping)
- [SQLite mappings](../../database-connectors/sqlite#prisma-migrate)

## Migration flows

See [migration flows](prisma-migrate-flows) for more advanced flows, including:

- Drafting and editing a `migration.sql` file before applying it
- Working with a populated database

## CLI command reference

## Limitations and known issues

### You cannot switch database providers

Prisma Migrate generates SQL files that are specific to your provider. This means that you cannot use PostgreSQL in production and SQLite in development, because the migrations cannot run.

In 2.15.0 and later, Prisma Migrate detects when the migrations do not match the configured provider and prints a helpful error message. For example, if your migrations are for a PostgreSQL database but you are using a `provider` is set to `mysql`:

```
Error: P3014

The datasource provider `mysql` specified in your schema does not match the one specified in the migration_lock.toml. You will encounter errors when you try to apply migrations generated for a different provider. Please archive your current migration directory at a different location and start a new migration history with `prisma migrate dev`.
```

### Lack of rollbacks / down migrations

Prisma Migrate does not currently roll back a migration without [resetting the database](#data-loss-when-resetting-database).
For a simple and integrated way to re-create data in your development database when the database is reset, check out our [seeding guide](../../../guides/prisma-guides/seed-database).

### Data loss when resetting database

In a development environment, Prisma Migrate sometimes prompts you to reset the database. Resetting drops and recreates the database, which results in data loss. The database is reset when:

- You call `prisma migrate reset --preview-feature` explicitly
- You call `prisma migrate dev --preview-feature` and Prisma Migrate detects drift in the database or a migration history conflict

The `prisma migrate dev --preview-feature` and `prisma migrate reset --preview-feature` commands are designed to be used **in development only**, and should not affect production data.

When the database is reset, if Prisma Migrate detects a seed script, it will trigger seeding.

> **Note**: For a simple and integrated way to re-create data when the database is reset, check out our [seeding guide](../../../guides/prisma-guides/seed-database).
