Prisma Migrate is an imperative database schema migration tool that enables you to make changes to your database schema. Migrations are auto-generated based on schema changes but are fully customizable. A simple Prisma Migrate workflow includes:

1. Detecting changes in your [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema), which is the source of truth for your data model
2. Generating `.sql` migration files with changes (which you can optionally modify)
3. Applying the migration files to your database

Prisma Migrate was introduced as a Preview feature in 2.13.0 and replaces [legacy Prisma Migrate](legacy-migrate).

## Basic example

The following example demonstrates how to get started with Prisma Migrate:

1. Create a Prisma schema:

  ```prisma
  datasource db {
    provider = "postgresql"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  }

  model User {
    id    Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
    name  String
    posts Post[]
  }

  model Post {
    id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
    title     String
    published Boolean @default(true)
    authorId  Int
    author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  }
  ```

1. Migrate your schema - you will be prompted to name the migration file (for example, `first_migration`):

  <CodeWithResult>

  <Cmd>

  ```terminal
  prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
  ```

  </Cmd>

  <CmdResult>

  ```
  √ Name of migration ... first-migration

  Prisma Migrate created and applied the following migration(s) from new schema changes:

  migrations/
  └─ 20201127130602_first_migration/
    └─ migration.sql

  ✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.13.0-dev.3) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 146ms

  Everything is now in sync.
  ```

  </CmdResult>

  </CodeWithResult>
  
    Prisma Migrate creates a `migration.sql` file with the following SQL and runs it against your database:

    ```sql
      -- CreateTable
    CREATE TABLE "User" (
    "id" SERIAL,
        "name" TEXT NOT NULL,

        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
    );
      -- CreateTable
    CREATE TABLE "Post" (
    "id" SERIAL,
        "title" TEXT NOT NULL,
        "published" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
        "authorId" INTEGER NOT NULL,

        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
    );

      -- AddForeignKey
    ALTER TABLE "Post" ADD FOREIGN KEY("authorId")REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;
    ```

    After you first migration, your Prisma Schema and database are now in sync.

1. Change the schema by adding two new fields:

   - One optional field (`bio`)
   - One mandatory field with a default value (`jobTitle`)

   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }

   model User {
     id    Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     name  String
   |  bio   String?
     posts Post[]
   |  jobTitle  String  @default("Blogger")
   }

   model Post {
     id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
     title     String
     published Boolean @default(true)
     authorId  Int
     author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
   }
   ```

1. Migrate your schema again:

  <CodeWithResult>

  <Cmd>

  ```terminal
  prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
  ```

  </Cmd>

  <CmdResult>

  ```
  √ Name of migration ... added_bio_jobTitle
  Prisma Migrate created and applied the following migration(s) from new schema changes:

  migrations/
    └─ 20201127133437_added_bio_job_title/
      └─ migration.sql

  ✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.13.0-dev.3) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 118ms

  Everything is now in sync.
  ```

  </CmdResult>

  </CodeWithResult>

  Prisma Migrate creates a second `migration.sql` file with the following contents and runs it against your database:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN     "bio" TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN     "jobTitle" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT E'Blogger';
  ```

  Your Prisma Schema and database are now in sync again.

1. Push the schema and the `prisma/migrations` folder to a shared repository - your team can now re-play the changes you made on their local database and contribute their own migrations:

  <CodeWithResult>

  <Cmd>

  ```terminal
  prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
  ```

  </Cmd>

  <CmdResult>

  ```
  Prisma Migrate applied the following unapplied migration(s):

  migrations/
    └─ 20201127130602_first_migration/
      └─ migration.sql
    └─ 20201127133437_added_bio_job_title/
      └─ migration.sql

  ✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.13.0-dev.3) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 107ms

  Everything is now in sync.
  ```

  </CmdResult>

  </CodeWithResult>

This example shows a 'happy path' without any complicating factors such as a populated database. For more advanced examples, see [Prisma Migrate flows](prisma-migrate-flows).

### Shadow database

Prisma Migrate uses a second, _temporary_ database when you run development-focused commands such as `prisma migrate dev --preview-feature` and `prisma migrate reset --preview-feature`. The shadow database is created and deleted each time you run a command, and is used for tasks suh as:

- Replaying the migration history
- Detecting drift

> **Note**: The shadow database is **not** required for production-focused commands: `prisma migrate resolve --preview-feature` and `prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature`.

In order to create and delete the shadow database, Prisma Migrate requires that the database user defined in your `datasource` has permission to create databases:

| Database | Database user requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| SQLite | No special requirements. |
| MySQL   | Database user must have `CREATE *.*` privileges |
| PostgreSQL | The user must be a super user or have `CREATEDB` privilege. See `CREATE ROLE` ([PostgreSQL official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createdatabase.html)) |
| SQL Server | The user must be a site admin or have the `SERVER` securable. See the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/permissions-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver15). |

## Migration flows

See [migration flows](prisma-migrate-flows) for more advanced flows, including:

- Drafting and editing a `migration.sql` file before applying it
- Working with a populated database

## Limitations and known issues

### Lack of rollbacks / down migrations

Prisma Migrate does not currently roll back a migration without [resetting the database](#data-loss-when-resetting-database). Follow [GitHub issue #9](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/9) for information about database seeding, which can mitigate the effect of data loss in a _development_ environment by allowing you to automatically repopulate your database.

### Data loss when resetting database

In a development environment, Prisma Migrate sometimes prompts you to reset the database. Resetting drops and recreates the database, which results in data loss. The database is reset when:

- You call `prisma migrate reset --preview-feature` explicitly
- You call `prisma migrate dev --preview-feature` and Prisma Migrate detects drift in the database or a migration history conflict

The `prisma migrate dev --preview-feature` and `prisma migrate reset --preview-feature` commands are designed to be used **in development only**, and should not affect poduction data.

### Native types preview not yet supported

Prisma Migrate does not yet support [native database type attributes (Preview)](preview-features/native-types).
