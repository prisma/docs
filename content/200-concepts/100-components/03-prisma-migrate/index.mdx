<Admonition type="info">

**Does not apply for MongoDB**<br/>Instead of `migrate dev` and related commands, use [`db push`](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push) for [MongoDB](/concepts/database-connectors/mongodb).

</Admonition>

Prisma Migrate is an **imperative database schema migration tool** that enables you to:

- Keep your database schema in sync with your [Prisma schema](/concepts/components/prisma-schema) as it evolves _and_
- Maintain existing data in your database

Prisma Migrate generates [a history of `.sql` migration files](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/migration-histories), and plays a role in both [development and deployment](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/migrate-development-production).

<Tip>

If you are prototyping, consider using the [`db push` command](db-push) - see [Schema prototyping with `db push`](/guides/database/prototyping-schema-db-push) <span class="guide"></span> for examples.
