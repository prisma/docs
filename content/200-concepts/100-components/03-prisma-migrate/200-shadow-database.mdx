Prisma Migrate uses a second, _temporary_ database when you run development-focused commands such as:

- `prisma migrate dev`
- `prisma migrate reset`

The shadow database is **created and deleted automatically**\* each time you run a development-focused command and is primarily used to **detect problems** such a schema drift.

<FootNote>

\* If you use a cloud-hosted database for development, you need to [create the shadow database manually](#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases-must-be-created-manually).

</FootNote>

> **Important**: The shadow database is **not** required in production, and is not used by production-focused commands such as `prisma migrate resolve` and `prisma migrate deploy`.

## How the shadow database works

When you run `prisma migrate dev` to create a new migration, Prisma Migrate uses the shadow database to:

- [Detect schema drift](#detecting-schema-drift), which means checking that no **manual changes** have been made to the development database
- [Generate new migrations](#generating-new-migrations)

### Detecting schema drift

To detect drift in development, Prisma Migrate:

1. Creates a fresh copy of the shadow database (or performs a soft reset if the shadow database is cloud-hosted)
1. Replays the **current** migration history in the shadow database.
1. **Introspects** the shadow database to generate the 'current state' of your Prisma schema.
1. Compares the end state of the current migration history to the development database.
1. Reports **schema drift** if the end state of the current migration history does not match the development database (for example, due to a manual change)

If Prisma Migrate does not detect schema drift, it moves on to [generating new migrations](#generating-new-migrations).

> **Note**: The shadow database is not responsible for checking if a migration file has been **edited or deleted**. This is done using the `checksum` field in the `_prisma_migrations` table.

In [2.25.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.25.0) and later, Prisma Migrate outputs detailed information about which parts of the database have drifted. In the following example output, the schema that would be generated from the target database differs from the expected schema. For example, the `Color` enum in the target database is missing the expected variant `RED` and include the unexpected variant `TRANSPARENT`:

```
[*] Changed the `Color` enum
  [+] Added variant `TRANSPARENT`
  [-] Removed variant `RED`

[*] Changed the `Cat` table
  [-] Removed column `color`
  [+] Added column `vaccinated`

[*] Changed the `Dog` table
  [-] Dropped the primary key on columns (id)
  [-] Removed column `name`
  [+] Added column `weight`
  [*] Altered column `isGoodDog` (arity changed from Nullable to Required, default changed from `None` to `Some(Value(Boolean(true)))`)
  [+] Added unique index on columns (weight)
```

### Generating new migrations

Assuming Prisma Migrate did not [detect schema drift](#detecting-schema-drift), it moves on to generating new migrations from schema changes. To generate new migrations, Prisma Migrate:

1. Calculates the target database schema as a function of the current Prisma schema.
1. Compares the end state of the existing migration history and the target schema, and generates steps to get from one to the other.
1. Renders these steps to a SQL string and saves it in the new migration file.
1. Applies the generated migration to the development database (assuming you have not specified the `--create-only` flag)
1. Drops the shadow database (cloud-hosted databases cannot be dropped, but are reset at the start of the `migrate dev` command)

## Cloud-hosted shadow databases must be created manually

Some cloud providers do not allow you to drop and create databases with SQL. Some require to create or drop the database via an online interface, and some really limit you to 1 database. If you **develop** in such a cloud-hosted environment, you must:

1. Create a dedicated cloud-hosted shadow database
2. Add the URL to the [`shadowDatabaseUrl`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) <span class="api"></span> field:

```prisma highlight=4;normal
datasource db {
  provider          = "postgresql"
  url               = env("DATABASE_URL")
  shadowDatabaseUrl = env("SHADOW_DATABASE_URL")
}
```

## Shadow database user permissions

In order to create and delete the shadow database when using development commands such as `migrate dev` and `migrate reset`, Prisma Migrate currently requires that the database user defined in your `datasource` has permission to **create databases**.

| Database   | Database user requirements                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLite     | No special requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| MySQL      | Database user must have `CREATE, ALTER, DROP, REFERENCES ON *.*` privileges                                                                                                                                           |
| PostgreSQL | The user must be a super user or have `CREATEDB` privilege. See `CREATE ROLE` ([PostgreSQL official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createdatabase.html))                                       |
| SQL Server | The user must be a site admin or have the `SERVER` securable. See the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/permissions-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver15). |

> If you use a cloud-hosted database for development and can not use these permissions, see: [Cloud-hosted shadow databases](#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases-must-be-created-manually)

Prisma Migrate throws the following error if it cannot create the shadow database with the credentials your connection URL supplied:

```
Error: A migration failed when applied to the shadow database
Database error: Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: permission denied to create database
```

To resolve this error:

- If you are working locally, we recommend that you change the database user's privileges.
- If you are developing against a cloud-based database (for example, on Heroku), we recommend that you change to a local web environment (such as running your development database on Docker) for the time being and follow the discussions on [GitHub issue #4571](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4571).
- If you are developing against a cloud-based database (for example, on Heroku) and **cannot** switch, please remain on version 2.12.0 and follow the discussions on [GitHub issue #4571](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4571).
- If you are developing against a cloud-based database (for example, on Heroku) and are currently **prototyping** such that you don't care about generated migration files and only need to apply your Prisma data model to the database schema, you can run [`prisma db push`](../../../reference/api-reference/command-reference#db) instead of the `prisma migrate dev` command.

> **Important**: The shadow database is _only_ required in a development environment (specifically for the `prisma migrate dev` command) - you **do not** need to make any changes to your production environment.
