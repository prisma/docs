> **Important!** This page documents legacy Prisma Migrate (Experimental) available in version 2.12.0 and earlier. [Prisma Migrate](.) is available in version [2.13.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.13.0) and Generally Available in [2.19.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.19.0).

Legacy Prisma Migrate is a tool that lets you _change your database schema_, e.g. by creating new tables or adding columns to existing tables. These changes are called _schema migrations_. legacy Prisma Migrate is available as part of the [Prisma CLI](/reference/api-reference/command-reference#installation) via the `legacy Prisma Migrate` command.

## Documentation

### Legacy Prisma Migrate vs the `db push` command

If you want to prototype or iterate on a schema design in a development environment, consider the [`db push` command](/reference/api-reference/command-reference#db-push).

### Legacy Prisma Migrate vs SQL migrations

Legacy Prisma Migrate is a _declarative_ migration system, as opposed to SQL which can be considered _imperative_:

- **SQL (imperative)**: Provide the individual _steps_ to get from the current schema to the desired schema.
- **legacy Prisma Migrate (declarative)**: Define the desired schema as a [Prisma data model](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model) (legacy Prisma Migrate takes care of generating the necessary _steps_).

Here's a quick comparison. Assume you have the following scenario:

1. You need to create the `User` table to store user information (name, email, ...)
1. Create two new tables `Post` and `Profile` with foreign keys to `User`
1. Add a new column with a default value to the `Post` table

#### SQL

In SQL, you'd have to send three subsequent SQL statements to account for this scenario:

##### 1. Create the `User` table to store user information (name, email, ...)

```sql
CREATE TABLE "User" (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

##### 2. Create two new tables `Post` and `Profile` with foreign keys to `User`

```sql
CREATE TABLE "Profile" (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    bio TEXT NOT NULL,
    "user" integer NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    FOREIGN KEY ("user") REFERENCES "User"(id)
);
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author integer NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (author) REFERENCES "User"(id)
);
```

##### 3. Add a new column with a default value to the `Post` table

```sql
ALTER TABLE "Post"
ADD COLUMN published BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

#### legacy Prisma Migrate

With legacy Prisma Migrate, you write the desired database schema in the form of a [Prisma data model](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model) inside your [Prisma schema file](/concepts/components/prisma-schema). To map the data model to your database schema, you then have to run these two commands:

```terminal
prisma migrate save --experimental
prisma migrate up --experimental
```

The first command _saves_ a new migration to the `prisma/migrations` directory in the file system of your project and updates the `_Migration` table in your database. Each time you run this command to save a new migration, it creates a dedicated directory inside of `prisma/migrations` for that specific migration, which will have its own `README.md` file containing detailed information about the migration (e.g. the generated SQL statements which will be executed when you run `legacy Prisma Migrate up`).

The second command _executes_ the migration against your database.

##### 1. Create the `User` table to store user information (name, email, ...)

Add the model to your Prisma schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String?
  email String  @unique
}
```

Now run the two commands mentioned above:

```terminal
prisma migrate save --experimental
prisma migrate up --experimental
```

##### 2. Create two new tables `Post` and `Profile` with foreign keys to `User`

Add two models with [relation fields](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations#relation-fields) to your Prisma schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name    String?
  email   String   @unique
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio    String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int
}

model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int
}
```

Notice that in addition to the [annotated relation fields](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations#annotated-relation-fields-and-relation-scalar-fields) and its relation scalar field (which represent the foreign keys), you must also specify the Prisma-level [relation fields](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations#relation-fields) on the other side of the relation.

Now run the two commands mentioned above:

```terminal
prisma migrate save --experimental
prisma migrate up --experimental
```

##### 3. Add a new column with default value to the `Post` table

Add a [field](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-fields) to the `Post` model:

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name    String?
  email   String   @unique
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio    String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  published Boolean @default(false)
  authorId  Int
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
```

Now run the two commands mentioned above:

```terminal
prisma migrate save --experimental
prisma migrate up --experimental
```

### Supported operations

The following table shows which SQL operations are currently supported by legacy Prisma Migrate.

Note that this table assumes that the operation is also supported by the underlying database. For example, `ENUM` is not supported in SQLite. This means that you also can't use `enum` when using legacy Prisma Migrate.

### Migration history

legacy Prisma Migrate stores the migration history of your project in two places:

- A directory called `migrations` on your file system
- A table called `_Migration` in your database

#### The `migrations` directory

The `migrations` directory stores information about the migrations that have been or will be executed against your database. You should never make any manual changes to the files in `migrations`. The only way to change the content of this directory should be using the `legacy Prisma Migrate save` command.

The `migrations` directory should be checked into version control (e.g. Git).

#### The `_Migration` table

The `_Migration` table additionally stores information about each migration that was ever executed against the database by legacy Prisma Migrate.

### Typical workflow

With **legacy Prisma Migrate**, the workflow looks slightly different:

1. Manually adjust your [Prisma data model](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model)
1. Migrate your database using the `legacy Prisma Migrate` CLI commands
1. (Re-)generate Prisma Client
1. Use Prisma Client in your application code to access your database

![Typical workflow with legacy Prisma Migrate](../../../doc-images/unused/OImder6.png)

### Troubleshooting

Since legacy Prisma Migrate is currently Experimental, you might end up in a state where the `migrations` directory and/or the `_Migrations` table are out of sync with the actual state of the database. In these cases, it often helps to "reset" legacy Prisma Migrate by deleting the `migrations` folder and deleting all entries from the `_Migration` table.

#### Delete the `migrations` directory

```terminal
rm -rf migrations
```

#### Delete all entries from the `_Migration` table

```sql
TRUNCATE _Migration;
```

## CLI Reference

> Warning: The `migrate` command is still considered Experimental. As such, there are no guarantees about API stability or production-readiness. Access to this command is provided for evaluation and experimentation. To access Experimental commands, you must add the `--experimental` flag.

The `migrate` command creates and manages database migrations. It can be used to create, apply, and rollback database schema updates in a controlled manner.

The `migrate` command includes a number of subcommands to specify the desired action.

### <inlinecode>migrate save</inlinecode>

Saves a migration that defines the steps necessary to update your current schema.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the `migrate save` command, you must define a valid [`datasource`](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-sources) within your `schema.prisma` file.

For example, the following `datasource` defines a SQLite database file within the current directory:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:my-database.db"
}
```

#### Options

The `migrate save` command recognizes the following options to modify its behavior:

| Option              | Required | Description                                                                                                                                         | Default                                     |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `--experimental`    | Yes      | Enables use of Experimental commands.                                                                                                               |                                             |
| `-n`, `--name`      | No       | The name of the migration. If not provided, `migrate save` will prompt you for a name.                                                              | Timestamp `20200618145356`                  |
| `-c`, `--create-db` | No       | Create the database if it does not exist.                                                                                                           |                                             |
| `-p`, `--preview`   | No       | Preview the migration that would be created without writing any changes to the filesystem.                                                          |                                             |
| `--schema`          | No       | Specifies the path to the desired `schema.prisma` file to be processed instead of the default path. Both absolute and relative paths are supported. | `./schema.prisma`, `./prisma/schema.prisma` |

#### Generated Assets

The `migrate save` command generates the following directories and files as necessary:

- `migrations`: A directory within the current project to store migrations. This directory will be created if it does not exist.
- `migrations/migrate.lock`: A lock file created specifying the current migration applied to the database. This file will be created if it does not exist.
- `migrations/<migration>`: A directory for a specific migration. The migration name is derived from the timestamp when it was created followed by a hyphen and the migration name provided by the user.
- `migrations/<migration>/README.md`: A human-readable description of the migration including metadata like when the migration was created and by who, a list of the actual migration changes and a diff of the changes that are made to the `schema.prisma` file.
- `migrations/<migration>/schema.prisma`: The schema that will be created if the migration is applied to the project.
- `migrations/<migration>/steps.json`: An [alternative representation](https://github.com/prisma/specs/tree/master/lift#step) of the migration steps that will be applied.

#### Examples

##### Create a new migration

```terminal
prisma migrate save --experimental
```

The command will prompt you for a name for the migration since one was not provided on the command line. After creating the migration, the contents of the generated `schema.prisma` file are displayed.

##### Create a migration with a specific name

```terminal
prisma migrate save --name "First migration" --experimental
```

##### Create the database if it does not already exist

```terminal
prisma migrate save --create-db --experimental
```

##### Preview the migration that would be created by running the `migrate save` command

```terminal
prisma migrate save --preview --experimental
```

### <inlinecode>migrate up</inlinecode>

Migrate the database up to a specific state.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the `migrate up` command, you must define a valid [`datasource`](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-sources) within your `schema.prisma` file.

For example, the following `datasource` defines a SQLite database file within the current directory:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:my-database.db"
}
```

#### Arguments

The point to migrate the database up to can be defined in any of the following three ways:

| Argument  | Required | Description                                                                        | Default |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| increment | No       | Specifies the number of forward migrations to apply.                               | latest  |
| name      | No       | Specifies where to migrate to using the name of the final migration to apply.      | latest  |
| timestamp | No       | Specifies where to migrate to using the timestamp of the final migration to apply. | latest  |

#### Options

Additionally, the following options modify the behavior of the `migrate up` command:

| Option              | Required | Description                                                                                                                                         | Default                                     |

| `--experimental`    | Yes      | Enables use of Experimental commands                                                                                                                |                                             |
| `-c`, `--create-db` | No       | Create the database if it does not exist.                                                                                                           |                                             |
| `-p`, `--preview`   | No       | Preview the migration that would be created without writing any changes to the filesystem.                                                          |                                             |
| `--schema`          | No       | Specifies the path to the desired `schema.prisma` file to be processed instead of the default path. Both absolute and relative paths are supported. | `./schema.prisma`, `./prisma/schema.prisma` |
| `--auto-approve`    | No       | Skip interactive approval before migrating.                                                                                                         |                                             |

#### Examples

##### Migrate the database up to the latest available migration

```terminal
prisma migrate up --experimental
```

##### Apply the next two migrations to the database

```terminal
prisma migrate up 2 --experimental
```

##### Apply all migrations necessary up to and including a migration by name

```terminal
prisma migrate up "First migration" --experimental
```

##### Apply all migrations necessary up to and including a migration by timestamp

```terminal
prisma migrate up 20200223181448 --experimental
```

##### Create the database if it does not already exist before applying the migrations

```terminal
prisma migrate up --create-db --experimental
```

##### Preview the migration that would be applied by running the `migrate up` command

```terminal
prisma migrate up --preview --experimental
```

### <inlinecode>migrate down</inlinecode>

Migrate the database down to a specific state.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the `migrate down` command, you must define a valid [`datasource`](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-sources) within your `schema.prisma` file.

For example, the following `datasource` defines a SQLite database file within the current directory:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:my-database.db"
}
```

#### Arguments

The point to migrate back to can be defined in any of the following three ways:

| Argument  | Required | Description                                                                             | Default |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| decrement | No       | Specifies the number of backwards migrations to apply.                                  | 1       |
| name      | No       | Specifies where to migrate back to using the name of the final migration to apply.      |
| timestamp | No       | Specifies where to migrate back to using the timestamp of the final migration to apply. |

#### Options

Additionally, the following options modify the behavior of the `migrate down` command:
