The following limitations apply to Prisma Migrate.

</TopBlock>

## You cannot switch database providers

Prisma Migrate generates SQL files that are specific to your provider. This means that you cannot use PostgreSQL in production and SQLite in development, because the migrations cannot run.

In [2.15.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/2.15.0) and later, Prisma Migrate detects when the migrations do not match the configured provider and prints a helpful error message. For example, if your migrations are for a PostgreSQL database but you are using a `provider` is set to `mysql`:

```
Error: P3014

The datasource provider `mysql` specified in your schema does not match the one specified in the migration_lock.toml. You will encounter errors when you try to apply migrations generated for a different provider. Please archive your current migration directory at a different location and start a new migration history with `prisma migrate dev`.
```

## Lack of rollbacks / down migrations

Prisma Migrate does not currently roll back a migration without [resetting the database](#data-loss-when-resetting-database).
For a simple and integrated way to re-create data in your development database when the database is reset, check out our [seeding guide](../../../guides/application-lifecycle/seed-database).

## Data loss when resetting database

In a development environment, Prisma Migrate sometimes prompts you to reset the database. Resetting drops and recreates the database, which results in data loss. The database is reset when:

- You call `prisma migrate reset` explicitly
- You call `prisma migrate dev` and Prisma Migrate detects drift in the database or a migration history conflict

The `prisma migrate dev` and `prisma migrate reset` commands are designed to be used **in development only**, and should not affect production data.

When the database is reset, if Prisma Migrate detects a seed script, it will trigger seeding.

> **Note**: For a simple and integrated way to re-create data when the database is reset, check out our [seeding guide](../../../guides/application-lifecycle/seed-database).
