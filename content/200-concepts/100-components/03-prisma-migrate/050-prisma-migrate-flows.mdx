## Modifying a migration

You can choose to change the behavior of a migration **when you create it**. For example, Prisma Migrate cannot automatically detect that you want to _rename_ a field - instead, it will add a new field and remove the old one. To rename the field instead (for example, `name` &rarr; `fullname`), you must create and modify a **draft migration**:

1. Make a change to your schema - for example, renaming a field:
 
    ```prisma file=schema.prisma
    model User {
    +  fullname String?
    -  name     String?
    }
    ```

1. Use the `--create-only` option to generate a **draft** migration:

    <CodeWithResult>
    <Cmd>

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate dev --create-only --preview-feature
    ```
    </Cmd>
    <CmdResult>
    ```
    Prisma Migrate created the following migration without applying it 20201208100950_fullname_field
    ```    
    </CmdResult>
    </CodeWithResult>

    Prisma Migrate does not apply this migration.

2. Edit the generated `20201208100950_fullname_field/migration.sql` file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "User" DROP COLUMN "name",
   - ADD COLUMN     "fullname" TEXT,
   + RENAME "name" TO  "fullname"
   ```

3. Apply the migration:

   ```terminal
   prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
   ```

## Collaborating with a team

To bring in changes to the database schema and migrations from collaborators, pull the changed Prisma Schema and the new migration files. Run `prisma migrate dev` to apply the changes. Running this command:

1. Checks if there are any migrations that have not yet been applied and applies those migrations
1. Checks for changes in the Prisma schema - if there are changes, Prisma creates and applies new migrations

## Handling migration history conflicts

A migration history conflict occurs when there are discrepancies between the **migrations folder in the file system** and the **`_prisma_migrations` table in the database**. This can happen if:

* A migration that has already been applied is later modified - for example, adding a comment or modifying the actual SQL of a `migration.sql` file. The SQL statement in the `migration.sql` file and the `_prisma_migrations` table are now different, resulting in a conflict.
* A migration that has already been applied is missing from the file system.  This can occur if you switch branches without committing your migrations, or as a result of a `git merge` issue.

### Developer environments

If Prisma Migrate detects a migration history conflict when you run `prisma migrate dev`, the CLI will ask to reset the database. Resetting the database:

1. Drops the database
2. Recreates the database
3. Applies all migrations

This approach makes sense if you modified a migrations file on purpose to do something that cannot be done via the Prisma Schema - for example, create a new column with an unsupported type.

### Production environments

If Prisma Migrate detects a migration history conflict when you run `prisma migrate dev`, you can deny the reset and manually reconcile the differences between your migrations folder and the `_prisma_migrations` table. For example:

1. Copy the missing or changed migrations files from source control
* Change statement in relevant `script` field in the `_prisma_migrations` table to match the change you made to the `migrations.sql` files

This approach makes sense if the conflict was the result of a mistake or a very small change that is not worth dropping and recreating the database.

## Handling database schema drift

Database schema drift occurs when your database schema is out of sync with your migration history - the database schema has 'drifted away' from the source of truth, which should be your migration history. Schema drift can occur if:

* The database schema was changed _without_ using migrations - for example, by using [`prisma db push`](../../reference/api-reference/command-reference#db-push) or manually changing the database schema.

The following scenario assume that you made a manual change in production and want to propagate that change to your migration history and other databases.

### Development environments

1. Make an equivalent change in the Prisma schema - for example, adding a field named `bio` and an index:

  ```prisma
  model User {
      bio   String?

      @@index([bio])
  }
  ```

1. Create and apply the new migration in dev:

   ```terminal
   prisma migrate dev
   ```   

1. Commit the new migration and allow your CI process to apply the migration to all other non-production databases.

### Production environments

When the manual change has been replicated in the Prisma schema, you must reconcile your migration history and database schema in production:

1. Mark the migration as 'already applied' so that Prisma Migrate does not try to create a field and index that already exists:

   ```terminal
   prisma migrate resolve --applied "20201127134938_added_bio_index"
   ```

   This command adds the migration to the migration history table without running the actual SQL.

## Handling a failed migration

A migration might fail if:

* You [modify a migration before running it]() and introduce a syntax error
* You add a mandatory (`NOT NULL`) column to a table that already has data
* The migration process stopped unexpectedly
* The database shut down in the middle of the migration process

### Developer environments

The easiest way to handle a failed migration in a developer environment is to address the root cause and reset the database. For example:

* If you introduced a SQL syntax error by manually editing the database, update the `migration.sql` file that failed and reset the database:

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate reset --preview-feature
    ```

* If you introduced a change in the Prisma schema that cannot be applied to a database with data (for example, a mandatory column in a table with data), reset the database:

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate reset --preview-feature
    ```

* If something interrupted the migration process, reset the database:

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate reset --preview-feature
    ```

### Production environments

#### Option 1: Roll back and re-run

1. Roll back entire migration

1. Fix migration if there was a problem

1. Re-run

```terminal
prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature
```

### Option 2: Manually complete migration and resolve

1. Manually roll back the steps that were completed

1. Roll back migration

   ```terminal
   prisma migrate resolve --applied "20201127134938_my_migration"
   ```
