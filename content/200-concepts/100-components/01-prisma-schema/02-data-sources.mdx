<TopBlock>

A data source determines how Prisma connects your database, and is represented by the [`datasource`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) <span class="api"></span> block in the Prisma schema. The following data source uses the `postgresql` provider and includes a connection string:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
}
```

A Prisma schema can only have _one_ data source. However, you can:

- [Programmatically override a data source `url`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#programmatically-override-a-datasource-url)
- [Specify a different URL for Prisma Migrate's shadow database if you are working with cloud-hosted development databases](../prisma-migrate#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases-must-be-created-manually)

## SSL certificates

Some data source `provider`s allow you to configure your connection with SSL, and provide parameters for the `url` to specificy the location of certificates.

- [Configuring an SSL connection with PostgreSQL](../../database-connectors/postgresql#configuring-an-ssl-connection)
- [Configuring an SSL connection with MySQL](../../database-connectors/mysql#configuring-an-ssl-connection)

Prisma resolves SSL certificates relative to the `./prisma` directory. If your certificate files are located outside that directory, e.g. your project root directory, use relative paths for certificates:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public&sslmode=require&sslcert=../server-ca.pem&sslidentity=../client-identity.p12&sslpassword=<REDACTED>"
}
```

## Multiple providers

> **Important**: [Multiple providers was deprecated in 2.11.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3834) and will be removed in a future release.

The `provider` field accepts an array of providers:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = ["postgresql", "mysql"]
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Prisma uses the provider that is compatible with the the value of the `url` field. Use cases for multiple providers include:

- You have multiple environments (development, QA, production) and each environment uses a different provider
