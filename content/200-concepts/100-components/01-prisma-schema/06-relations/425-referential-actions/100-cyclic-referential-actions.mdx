<TopBlock>

Circular references can occur between models when each model references another, creating a closed loop. Most SQL databases handle these references out of the box.

With Microsoft SQL Server however, if the [referential actions](./) on the foreign key are set to something other than `NO ACTION`, it will check for cycles or multiple cascade paths and return an error when executing the SQL.

Given the SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employee] (
  [id] INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
  [managerId] INT,
  CONSTRAINT [PK__Employee__id] PRIMARY KEY ([id])
);

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employee]
  ADD CONSTRAINT [FK__Employee__managerId]
    FOREIGN KEY ([managerId]) REFERENCES [dbo].[Employee]([id])
    ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

When the SQL is run, the database would throw the following error:

```terminal
Introducing FOREIGN KEY constraint 'FK__Employee__managerId' on table 'Employee' may cause cycles or multiple cascade paths. Specify ON DELETE NO ACTION or ON UPDATE NO ACTION, or modify other FOREIGN KEY constraints.
```

In more complex data models, finding the cycles can get complex. Therefore in Prisma, the data model is validated _before_ generating any SQL to be run during any migrations, highlighting relations that are part of the cycle. This makes it much easier to find and break these cyclic referential actions.

## Self-relation

The following model describes a self-relation where an `Employee` can have a manager and managees, referencing itself.

```prisma
model Employee {
  id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  manager    Employee?  @relation(name: "management", fields: [managerId], references: [id])
  managees   Employee[] @relation(name: "management")
  managerId  Int?
}
```

This will result in the following error:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": A self-relation must have `onDelete` and `onUpdate` referential actions set to `NoAction` in one of the @relation attributes. Implicit default `onDelete` and `onUpdate` values: `SetNull` and `Cascade`.
```

By not defining any actions, Prisma will use the following default values depending if the underlying [scalar fields](../../data-model#scalar-fields) are set to be optional or required.

| Clause     | All of the scalar fields are optional | At least one scalar field is required |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| `onDelete` | `SetNull`                             | `NoAction`                            |
| `onUpdate` | `Cascade`                             | `Cascade`                             |

Since the default referential action for `onUpdate` in the above relation would be `Cascade` and for `onDelete` it would be `SetNull`, it creates a cycle and the solution is to explicitly set the `onUpdate` and `onDelete` values to `NoAction`.

```prisma highlight=3;delete|4;add
model Employee {
  id        Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  manager   Employee   @relation(name: "management", fields: [managerId], references: [id])
  manager   Employee   @relation(name: "management", fields: [managerId], references: [id], onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction)
  managed   Employee[] @relation(name: "management")
  managerId Int
}
```

## Cycle relation between three tables

The following models describe a cyclic relation between a `Chicken`, an `Egg` and a `Fox`, where each model references the other.

```prisma
model Chicken {
  id        Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  egg       Egg   @relation(fields: [eggId], references: [id])
  eggId     Int
  predators Fox[]
}

model Egg {
  id         Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  predator   Fox       @relation(fields: [predatorId], references: [id])
  predatorId Int
  parents    Chicken[]
}

model Fox {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  meal      Chicken @relation(fields: [mealId], references: [id])
  mealId    Int
  foodStore Egg[]
}
```

This will result in three validation errors in every relation field that is part of the cycle.

The first one is in the relation `egg` in the `Chicken` model:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": Reference causes a cycle or multiple cascade paths. One of the @relation attributes in this cycle must have `onDelete` and `onUpdate` referential actions set to `NoAction`. Cycle path: Chicken.egg → Egg.predator → Fox.meal. Implicit default `onUpdate` value: `Cascade`.
```

The second one is in the relation `predator` in the `Egg` model:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": Reference causes a cycle or multiple cascade paths. One of the @relation attributes in this cycle must have `onDelete` and `onUpdate` referential actions set to `NoAction`. Cycle path: Egg.predator → Fox.meal → Chicken.egg. Implicit default `onUpdate` value: `Cascade`.
```

And the third one is in the relation `meal` in the `Fox` model:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": Reference causes a cycle or multiple cascade paths. One of the @relation attributes in this cycle must have `onDelete` and `onUpdate` referential actions set to `NoAction`. Cycle path: Fox.meal → Chicken.egg → Egg.predator. Implicit default `onUpdate` value: `Cascade`.
```

As the relation fields are required, the default referential action for `onDelete` is `NoAction`, meaning the solution is to set the `onUpdate` value to `NoAction` on any one of the relations.

```prisma highlight=3;delete|4;add
model Chicken {
  id        Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  egg       Egg   @relation(fields: [eggId], references: [id])
  egg       Egg   @relation(fields: [eggId], references: [id], onUpdate: NoAction)
  eggId     Int
  predators Fox[]
}

model Egg {
  id         Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  predator   Fox       @relation(fields: [predatorId], references: [id])
  predatorId Int
  parents    Chicken[]
}

model Fox {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  meal      Chicken @relation(fields: [mealId], references: [id])
  mealId    Int
  foodStore Egg[]
}
```
