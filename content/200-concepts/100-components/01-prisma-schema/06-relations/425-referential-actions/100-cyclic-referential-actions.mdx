Circular references can occur between models when each model references another, creating a closed loop. Most SQL databases handle these references out of the box. 

With Microsoft SQL Server, however, if the [referential actions](./) on the relation field is set to something other than `NoAction`, the data model validator will throw an error.

This is dependent on whether or not the underlying scalar fields are set to be optional or required. If no referential action is specified on the relation, the default values are used:

| Clause     | All of the scalar fields are optional | At least one scalar field is required |
| :--------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `onDelete` | `SetNull`                | `NoAction`                            |
| `onUpdate` | `Cascade`                | `Cascade`                             |

## Self relation

The following model describes a self relation where the chicken references itself with fields that represent both the mother and father chickens.

```prisma
model Chicken {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  cock      Chicken? @relation(name: "a_self_relation")
  hen       Chicken? @relation(name: "a_self_relation", fields: [chickenId], references: [id])
  chickenId Int?
}
```

This will result in the following error:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": A self-relation must have `onDelete` and `onUpdate` referential actions set to `NoAction` in one of the @relation attributes. Implicit default `onDelete` and `onUpdate` values: `SetNull` and `Cascade`.
```

Since the default referential actions (`onDelete: SetNull`, `onUpdate: Cascade`) are creating a cycle, the solution is to explicitly set the `onDelete` and `onUpdate` values to `NoAction` on one of the relations.

```prisma highlight=4;delete|5;add
model Chicken {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  cock      Chicken? @relation(name: "a_self_relation")
  hen       Chicken? @relation(name: "a_self_relation", fields: [chickenId], references: [id])
  hen       Chicken? @relation(name: "a_self_relation", fields: [chickenId], references: [id], onUpdate: NoAction, onDelete: NoAction)
  chickenId Int?
}
```

## Cycle relation between three tables

The following models describe a cyclic relation between a chicken, an egg and a fox, where each model references the other.

```prisma
model Chicken {
  id        Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  egg       Egg   @relation(fields: [eggId], references: [id])
  eggId     Int
  predators Fox[]
}

model Egg {
  id         Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  predator   Fox       @relation(fields: [predatorId], references: [id])
  predatorId Int
  parents    Chicken[]
}

model Fox {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  meal      Chicken @relation(fields: [mealId], references: [id])
  mealId    Int
  foodStore Egg[]
}
```

This will result in the following error:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": Reference causes a cycle or multiple cascade paths. One of the @relation attributes in this cycle must have `onDelete` and `onUpdate` referential actions set to `NoAction`. Implicit default `onUpdate` value: `Cascade`.
```

As the relation fields are required, the default referential action for `onDelete` is `NoAction`, meaning the solution is to set the `onUpdate` value to `NoAction` on any one of the relations.

```prisma highlight=3;delete|4;add
model Chicken {
  id        Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  egg       Egg   @relation(fields: [eggId], references: [id])
  egg       Egg   @relation(fields: [eggId], references: [id], onUpdate: NoAction)
  eggId     Int
  predators Fox[]
}

model Egg {
  id         Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  predator   Fox       @relation(fields: [predatorId], references: [id])
  predatorId Int
  parents    Chicken[]
}

model Fox {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  meal      Chicken @relation(fields: [mealId], references: [id])
  mealId    Int
  foodStore Egg[]
}
```
