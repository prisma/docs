<TopBlock>

In [2.26.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.26.0) and later, you can define **referential actions** on your relation fields. Referential actions determine what should happen to a record when a related record is deleted or updated.

In the following example, adding `onDelete: Cascade` to the `author` field on the `Post` model means that deleting the `User` record will also delete all related `Post` records.

```prisma highlight=4;normal
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

If you do not specify a referential action, Prisma [uses a default](#referential-action-defaults).

</TopBlock>

<Admonition type="alert">

It is extremely important that you check the [upgrade paths for referential actions](#upgrade-paths) section before you continue. The `referentialActions` feature **removes the safety net in Prisma Client that prevents cascading deletes at runtime**. If you use the feature _without upgrading your database_, the [old default action](#the-2250-default-referential-actions) - `ON DELETE CASCADE` - becomes active. This may result in cascading deletes that you did not expect.

</Admonition>

## What are referential actions?

Referential actions are policies that define how a referenced record is handled by the database when you run an [`update`](../../../prisma-client/crud#update) or [`delete`](../../../prisma-client/crud#delete) query.

<details><summary>Referential actions on the database level</summary>

Referential actions are features of foreign key constraints that exist to preserve referential integrity in your database.

When you define relationships between data models in your Prisma schema, you use [relation fields](../#relation-fields), **which do not exist on the database**, and [scalar fields](../../data-model/#scalar-fields), **which do exist on the database**. These foreign keys connect the models on the database level.

Referential integrity states that these foreign keys must reference an existing primary key value in the related database table. In your Prisma schema, this is generally represented by the `id` field on the related model.

By default a database will reject any operation that violates the referential integrity, for example, by deleting referenced records.

</details>

### How to use referential actions

Referential actions are defined in the [`@relation`](../../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#relation) attribute and map to the actions on the **foreign key constraint** in the underlying database. If you do not specify a referential action, [Prisma falls back to a default](#referential-action-defaults).

The following model defines a 1-m relation between `User` and `Post` and a n-m relation between `Post` and `Tag`, with explicitly defined referential actions:

```prisma highlight=10,16-17;normal
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id     Int          @id @default(autoincrement())
  title  String
  tags   TagOnPosts[]
  User   User?        @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull, onUpdate: Cascade)
  userId Int?
}

model TagOnPosts {
  id     Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  post   Post? @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id], onUpdate: Cascade, onDelete: Cascade)
  tag    Tag?  @relation(fields: [tagId], references: [id], onUpdate: Cascade, onDelete: Cascade)
  postId Int?
  tagId  Int?
}

model Tag {
  id    Int          @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String       @unique
  posts TagOnPosts[]
}
```

- If you delete a `Tag`, the corresponding tag assignment is also deleted `TagOnPost` (`Cascade`)
- If you delete a `User`, the author is removed from all posts (`SetNull`) - `User` and `userId` must be optional

Prisma supports the following referential actions:

- [`Cascade`](#cascade)
- [`Restrict`](#restrict)
- [`NoAction`](#noaction)
- [`SetNull`](#setnull)
- [`SetDefault`](#setdefault)

### Referential action defaults

If you do not specify a referential action, Prisma uses the following defaults:

| Clause     | Optional relations | Mandatory relations |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| `onDelete` | `SetNull`          | `Restrict`          |
| `onUpdate` | `Cascade`          | `Cascade`           |

For example - in the following schema, all `Post` records must be connected to an `author`. The schema **does not explicitly define referential actions** on the `author` field, which means that default referential actions apply (see SQL tab):

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="schema.prisma" icon="prisma"/>, <FileWithIcon text="SQL" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma highlight=4;normal
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```sql highlight=5;normal
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
  "id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  "title" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "authorId" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY ("authorId") REFERENCES "User" ("id") ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE "User" (
  "id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
);
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

## Caveats

The following caveats apply:

- Referential actions are **not** supported on [implicit many-to-many relations](../many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations). To use referential actions, you must define an explicit many-to-many relation and define your referential actions on the [join table](../troubleshooting-relations#how-to-use-a-relation-table-with-a-many-to-many-relationship).
- Certain combinations of referential actions and required/optional relations are incompatible. For example, using `SetNull` on a required relation will lead to database errors when deleting referenced records because the non-nullable constraint would be violated. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7909) for more information.

## Types of referential actions

The following table shows which referential action each database supports.

<Admonition type="info">

Note that [`NoAction`](#noaction) can be used in replace of [`Restrict`](#restrict) when working with an SQLServer database.

</Admonition>

| Database   | Cascade | Restrict | NoAction | SetNull | SetDefault |
| :--------- | :------ | :------- | :------- | :------ | :--------- |
| PostgreSQL | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**   | **✔️**  | **✔️**     |
| MySQL      | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**   | **✔️**  | **✔️**†    |
| SQLite     | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**   | **✔️**  | **✔️**     |
| SQLServer  | **✔️**  | **❌**   | **✔️**   | **✔️**  | **✔️**     |

- † On [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-introduction.html#:~:text=InnoDB%20is%20a%20general%2Dpurpose,clause%20creates%20an%20InnoDB%20table.), `SetDefault` will be ignored and silently use `NoAction`.

### <inlinecode>Cascade</inlinecode>

- `onDelete: Cascade` Deleting a referenced record will trigger the deletion of referencing record.

- `onUpdate: Cascade` Updates the relation scalar fields if the referenced scalar fields of the dependant record are updated.

#### Example usage

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `Cascade`

If a `User` record is deleted, then their posts are deleted too. If the user's `id` is updated, then the corresponding `authorId` is also updated.

    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### <inlinecode>Restrict</inlinecode>

- `onDelete: Restrict` Prevents the deletion if any referencing records exist.

- `onUpdate: Restrict` Prevents the identifier of a referenced record from being changed.

#### Example usage

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict, onUpdate: Restrict)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `Restrict`

`User`'s with posts **cannot** be deleted. The `Post`'s `id` **cannot** be changed.

<Admonition type="warning">

The `Restrict` action is **not** available on [Microsoft SQL Server](../../../../database-connectors/microsoft-sql-server) and will trigger a schema validation error. Instead, you can use [`NoAction`](#noaction), which produces the same result and is compatible with SQLServer.

</Admonition>

### <inlinecode>NoAction</inlinecode>

The `NoAction` action is similar to `Restrict`, the difference between the two is dependant on the database being used:

- **PostgreSQL**: `NoAction` allows the check (if a referenced row on the table exists) to be deferred until later in the transaction. See [the PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-FK) for more information.
- **MySQL**: `NoAction` behaves exactly the same as `Restrict`. See [the MySQL docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html#foreign-key-referential-actions) for more information.
- **SQLite**: When a related primary key is modified or deleted, no action is taken. See [the SQLite docs](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions) for more information.
- **SQLServer**: When a referenced record is deleted or modified, an error is raised. See [the SQLServer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/graph-edge-constraints?view=sql-server-ver15#on-delete-referential-actions-on-edge-constraints) for more information.

#### Example usage

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `NoAction`

`User`'s with posts **cannot** be deleted. The `Post`'s `id` **cannot** be changed.

### <inlinecode>SetNull</inlinecode>

- `onDelete: SetNull` The scalar field of the referenced object will be set to `NULL`.

- `onUpdate: SetNull` When updating the identifier of a referenced object, the scalar fields of the referencing objects will be set to `NULL`.

`SetNull` will only work on optional relations. On required relations, a runtime error will be thrown since the scalar fields cannot be null.

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User?  @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull, onUpdate: SetNull)
  authorId Int?
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `SetNull`

When deleting a `User`, the `authorId` will be set to `NULL` for all its authored posts.

When changing a `User`'s `id`, the `authorId` will be set to `NULL` for all its authored posts.

### <inlinecode>SetDefault</inlinecode>

- `onDelete: SetDefault` The scalar field of the referencing object will be set to the fields default value.

- `onUpdate: SetDefault` The scalar field of the referencing object will be set to the fields default value.

These require setting a default for the relation scalar field with [`@default`](../../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#default). If no defaults are provided for any of the scalar fields, a runtime error will be thrown.

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4,5;add
model Post {
  id             Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title          String
  authorUsername String? @default("anonymous")
  author         User?   @relation(fields: [authorUsername], references: [username], onDelete: SetDefault, onUpdate: SetDefault)
}

model User {
  username String @id
  posts    Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `SetDefault`

When deleting a `User`, its existing authored posts will now be authored by a `User` with `id` "anonymous".

When the `username` of a `User` changes, its existing authored posts will now be authored by `User` with `username` "anonymous".

## Upgrade paths

There are a couple of paths you can take when upgrading which will give different results depending on the desired outcome.

If you currently use the migration workflow, you can run an introspection to check how the defaults are reflected in your schema. You can then manually update your database if you need to.

You can also decide to skip checking the the defaults and run a migration to update your database with the [new default values](#referential-action-defaults).

### Using Introspection

If you [Introspect](../../../introspection) your database, the referential actions configured at the database level will be reflected in your Prisma Schema. If you have been using Prisma Migrate or `prisma db push` to manage the database schema, these are likely to be the [<=2.25.0 default values](#the-2250-default-referential-actions).

When you run an Introspection, Prisma compares all the foreign keys in the database with the schema, if the SQL statements `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` do **not** match the default values, they will be explicitly set in the schema file.

After introspecting, you can review the non-default clauses in your schema. The most important clause to review is `onDelete`, which defaults to `Cascade` in 2.25.0 and earlier.

<Admonition type="alert">

If you are using either the [`delete()`](../../../../../guides/database/advanced-database-tasks/cascading-deletes/postgresql#91-validating-restrict) or [`deleteAll()`](../../../prisma-client/crud#delete-all-records) methods, **[cascading deletes](#how-to-use-cascading-deletes) will now be performed** as the `referentialActions` feature **removes the safety net in Prisma Client that previously prevented cascading deletes at runtime**. Be sure to check your code and make any adjustments accordingly.

</Admonition>

Make sure you are happy with every case of `onDelete: Cascade` in your schema. If not, either:

- Modify your Prisma schema and `db push` or `dev migrate` to change the database*or*
- Manually update the underlying database if you use an introspection-only workflow

The following example would result in a cascading delete, if the `User` is deleted then all of their `Post`'s will be deleted too.

#### A blog schema example

```prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

### Using Migration

When running a [Migration](../../../prisma-migrate) (or the [`prisma db push`](../../../prisma-migrate/db-push) command) the [new defaults](#referential-action-defaults) will be applied to your database.

<Admonition type="info">

Unlike when you run an Introspect for the first time, the new referential actions clause and property, will **not** automatically be addded to your prisma schema by the Prisma VSCode extension.
You will have to manually add them if you wish to use anything other than the new defaults.

</Admonition>

Explicitly defining referential actions in your Prisma schema is optional. If you do not explicitly define a referential action for a relation, Prisma uses the [new defaults](#referential-action-defaults).

Note that referential actions can be added on a case by case basis. This means that you can add them to one single relation and leave the rest set to the defaults by not manually specifying anything.

### Checking for errors

**Before** upgrading to 2.26.0, Prisma prevented the deletion of records while using `delete()` or `deleteMany()` to preserve referential integrity. A custom runtime error would be thrown by the Prisma Client with the error code `P2014`.

**After** upgrading, Prisma no longer performs runtime checks. You can instead specify a custom referential action to preserve the referential integrity between relations.

When you use [`NoAction`](#noaction) or [`Restrict`](#restrict) to prevent the deletion of records, the error messages will be different post 2.26.0 compared to pre 2.26.0. This is because they are now triggered by the database and **not** the Prisma Client. The new error code that can be expected is `P2003`.

To make sure you catch these new errors you can adjust your code accordingly.

#### Example of catching errors

The following example uses the below blog schema with a 1-m relationship between `Post` and `User` and sets a [`Restrict`](#restrict) referential actions on the `author` field.

This means that if a user has a post, that user (and their posts) **cannot** be deleted.

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict)
  authorId String
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

Prior to upgrading, the error code you would receive when trying to delete a user which has posts would be `P2014` and it's message:

> "The change you are trying to make would violate the required relation '{relation_name}' between the {model_a_name} and {model_b_name} models."

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  try {
    await prisma.user.delete({
      where: {
        id: 'some-long-id',
      },
    })
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Prisma.PrismaClientKnownRequestError) {
      if (error.code === 'P2014') {
        console.log(error.message)
      }
    }
  }
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

To make sure you are checking for the correct errors in your code, modify your check to look for `P2003`, which will deliver the message:

> "Foreign key constraint failed on the field: {field_name}"

```ts highlight=14;delete|15;add
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  try {
    await prisma.user.delete({
      where: {
        id: 'some-long-id'
      }
    })
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Prisma.PrismaClientKnownRequestError) {
      if (error.code === 'P2014') {
      if (error.code === 'P2003') {
        console.log(error.message)
      }
    }
  }
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

## Behavior in <=2.25.0 <inlinecode>referentialActions</inlinecode>

<a id="current"></a>

The following behavior applies in 2.25.0 and earlier.

When invoking the [`delete()`](../../../../../guides/database/advanced-database-tasks/cascading-deletes/postgresql#91-validating-restrict) or [`deleteAll()`](../../../prisma-client/crud#delete-all-records) methods using the Prisma Client on required relations, a runtime check is performed and the deletion of records prevented if they are referencing related objects. **This prevents cascade behavior**.

The current behavior, without upgrading and enabling the feature flag, does not allow setting referential actions at all.

### The <=2.25.0 default referential actions

| Clause     | Optional relations | Mandatory relations |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| `onDelete` | `SetNull`          | `Cascade`           |
| `onUpdate` | `Cascade`          | `Cascade`           |

If you need to actually use the cascade behavior configured in the database, you _can_ use [`$raw`](../../../prisma-client/raw-database-access) SQL queries to [delete multiple referenced records](../../../prisma-client/crud#deleting-all-data-with-raw-sql--truncate) (such as users blog posts) and the deletion will be successful. This is because the Prisma Client will **not** perform runtime checks on raw queries.
