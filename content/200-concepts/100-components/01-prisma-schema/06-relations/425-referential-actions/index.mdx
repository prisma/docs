Referential actions determine what happens to a record when a related record is deleted or updated. Since version [3.0.1](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/3.0.10) (and in version [2.26.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.26.0) up to 3.0.1 when using the preview feature flag `referentialActions`), you can define referential actions on your relation fields in your Prisma schema.

In the following example, adding `onDelete: Cascade` to the `author` field on the `Post` model means that deleting the `User` record will also delete all related `Post` records.

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;normal
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

If you do not specify a referential action, Prisma [uses a default](#referential-action-defaults).

<Admonition type="alert">

If you are upgrading from a Prisma version earlier than 3.0.1 (or 2.26.0 if you are planning to activate the `referentialActions` preview feature), it is extremely important that you review the documentation on [upgrade paths for referential actions](/guides/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-3/referential-actions) section before you continue. The `referentialActions` feature **removes a previous safety functionality in Prisma Client that prevents cascading deletes at runtime**. If you use the feature _without upgrading your database_, the [old default action](/guides/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-3/referential-actions#prisma-2x-default-referential-actions) - `ON DELETE CASCADE` - becomes active. This might result in cascading deletes that you did not expect.

## What are referential actions?

Referential actions are policies that define how a referenced record is handled by the database when you run an [`update`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/crud#update) or [`delete`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/crud#delete) query.

<details><summary>Referential actions on the database level</summary>

Referential actions are features of foreign key constraints that exist to preserve referential integrity in your database.

When you define relationships between data models in your Prisma schema, you use [relation fields](/concepts/components/prisma-schema#relation-fields), **which do not exist on the database**, and [scalar fields](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#scalar-fields), **which do exist on the database**. These foreign keys connect the models on the database level.

Referential integrity states that these foreign keys must reference an existing primary key value in the related database table. In your Prisma schema, this is generally represented by the `id` field on the related model.

By default a database will reject any operation that violates the referential integrity, for example, by deleting referenced records.

</details>

### How to use referential actions

Referential actions are defined in the [`@relation`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#relation) attribute and map to the actions on the **foreign key constraint** in the underlying database. If you do not specify a referential action, [Prisma falls back to a default](#referential-action-defaults).

The following model defines a one-to-many relation between `User` and `Post` and a many-to-many relation between `Post` and `Tag`, with explicitly defined referential actions:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=10,16-17;normal
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id     Int          @id @default(autoincrement())
  title  String
  tags   TagOnPosts[]
  User   User?        @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull, onUpdate: Cascade)
  userId Int?
}

model TagOnPosts {
  id     Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  post   Post? @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id], onUpdate: Cascade, onDelete: Cascade)
  tag    Tag?  @relation(fields: [tagId], references: [id], onUpdate: Cascade, onDelete: Cascade)
  postId Int?
  tagId  Int?
}

model Tag {
  id    Int          @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String       @unique
  posts TagOnPosts[]
}
```

This model explicitly defines the following referential actions:

- If you delete a `Tag`, the corresponding tag assignment is also deleted in `TagOnPosts`, using the `Cascade` referential action
- If you delete a `User`, the author is removed from all posts by setting the field value to `Null`, because of the `SetNull` referential action. To allow this, `User` and `userId` must be optional fields in `Post`.

Prisma supports the following referential actions:

- [`Cascade`](#cascade)
- [`Restrict`](#restrict)
- [`NoAction`](#noaction)
- [`SetNull`](#setnull)
- [`SetDefault`](#setdefault)

### Referential action defaults

If you do not specify a referential action, Prisma uses the following defaults:

| Clause     | Optional relations | Mandatory relations |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| `onDelete` | `SetNull`          | `Restrict`          |
| `onUpdate` | `Cascade`          | `Cascade`           |

For example, in the following schema all `Post` records must be connected to a `User` via the `author` relation:

```prisma highlight=4;normal
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

The schema does not explicitly define referential actions on the mandatory `author` relation field, which means that the default referential actions of `Restrict` for `onDelete` and `Cascade` for `onUpdate` apply.

## Caveats

The following caveats apply:

- Referential actions are **not** supported on [implicit many-to-many relations](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations). To use referential actions, you must define an explicit many-to-many relation and define your referential actions on the [join table](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/troubleshooting-relations#how-to-use-a-relation-table-with-a-many-to-many-relationship).
- Certain combinations of referential actions and required/optional relations are incompatible. For example, using `SetNull` on a required relation will lead to database errors when deleting referenced records because the non-nullable constraint would be violated. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7909) for more information.

## Types of referential actions

The following table shows which referential action each database supports.

| Database   | Cascade | Restrict | NoAction | SetNull | SetDefault |
| :--------- | :------ | :------- | :------- | :------ | :--------- |
| PostgreSQL | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**   | **✔️**  | **✔️**     |
| MySQL      | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**   | **✔️**  | **✔️**†    |
| SQLite     | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**   | **✔️**  | **✔️**     |
| SQL Server | **✔️**  | **❌**‡  | **✔️**   | **✔️**  | **✔️**     |
| MongoDB††  | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**   | **✔️**  | **❌**     |

- † On [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-introduction.html#:~:text=InnoDB%20is%20a%20general%2Dpurpose,clause%20creates%20an%20InnoDB%20table.), `SetDefault` is ignored and is silently replaced with `NoAction` instead.
- ‡ [`NoAction`](#noaction) can be used in place of [`Restrict`](#restrict) when working with an SQL Server database.
- †† Referential Actions for MongoDB are available from version 3.7.0 and later.

### <inlinecode>Cascade</inlinecode>

- `onDelete: Cascade` Deleting a referenced record will trigger the deletion of referencing record.
- `onUpdate: Cascade` Updates the relation scalar fields if the referenced scalar fields of the dependent record are updated.

#### Example usage

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `Cascade`

If a `User` record is deleted, then their posts are deleted too. If the user's `id` is updated, then the corresponding `authorId` is also updated.

  ></iframe>
</div>

### <inlinecode>Restrict</inlinecode>

- `onDelete: Restrict` Prevents the deletion if any referencing records exist.
- `onUpdate: Restrict` Prevents the identifier of a referenced record from being changed.

#### Example usage

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict, onUpdate: Restrict)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `Restrict`

`User`s with posts **cannot** be deleted. The `User`'s `id` **cannot** be changed.

<Admonition type="warning">

The `Restrict` action is **not** available on [Microsoft SQL Server](/concepts/database-connectors/sql-server) and triggers a schema validation error. Instead, you can use [`NoAction`](#noaction), which produces the same result and is compatible with SQL Server.

</Admonition>

### <inlinecode>NoAction</inlinecode>

The `NoAction` action is similar to `Restrict`, the difference between the two is dependent on the database being used:

- **PostgreSQL**: `NoAction` allows the check (if a referenced row on the table exists) to be deferred until later in the transaction. See [the PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-FK) for more information.
- **MySQL**: `NoAction` behaves exactly the same as `Restrict`. See [the MySQL docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html#foreign-key-referential-actions) for more information.
- **SQLite**: When a related primary key is modified or deleted, no action is taken. See [the SQLite docs](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions) for more information.
- **SQL Server**: When a referenced record is deleted or modified, an error is raised. See [the SQL Server docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/graph-edge-constraints?view=sql-server-ver15#on-delete-referential-actions-on-edge-constraints) for more information.
- **MongoDB** (in preview from version 3.6.0): When a record is modified or deleted, nothing is done to any related records.

<Admonition type="warning">

If you are [emulating referential integrity](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/referential-integrity#handling-the-referential-integrity-in-prisma) in the Prisma client rather than using foreign keys in the database, you should be aware that currently Prisma only implements the referential actions. Foreign keys also create constraints, which make it impossible to manipulate data in a way that would violate these constraints: instead of executing the query, the database responds with an error. These constraints will not be created if you emulate referential integrity in the client, so if you set the referential action to `NoAction` there will be no checks to prevent you from breaking the referential integrity.

</Admonition>

#### Example usage

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `NoAction`

`User`'s with posts **cannot** be deleted. The `User`'s `id` **cannot** be changed.

### <inlinecode>SetNull</inlinecode>

- `onDelete: SetNull` The scalar field of the referencing object will be set to `NULL`.

- `onUpdate: SetNull` When updating the identifier of a referenced object, the scalar fields of the referencing objects will be set to `NULL`.

`SetNull` will only work on optional relations. On required relations, a runtime error will be thrown since the scalar fields cannot be null.

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User?  @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull, onUpdate: SetNull)
  authorId Int?
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `SetNull`

When deleting a `User`, the `authorId` will be set to `NULL` for all its authored posts.

When changing a `User`'s `id`, the `authorId` will be set to `NULL` for all its authored posts.

### <inlinecode>SetDefault</inlinecode>

- `onDelete: SetDefault` The scalar field of the referencing object will be set to the fields default value.

- `onUpdate: SetDefault` The scalar field of the referencing object will be set to the fields default value.

These require setting a default for the relation scalar field with [`@default`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#default). If no defaults are provided for any of the scalar fields, a runtime error will be thrown.

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4,5;add
model Post {
  id             Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title          String
  authorUsername String? @default("anonymous")
  author         User?   @relation(fields: [authorUsername], references: [username], onDelete: SetDefault, onUpdate: SetDefault)
}

model User {
  username String @id
  posts    Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `SetDefault`

When deleting a `User`, its existing posts' `authorUsername` field values will be set to 'anonymous'.

When the `username` of a `User` changes, its existing posts' `authorUsername` field values will be set to 'anonymous'.
