Some databases have specific requirements that you should consider if you are using referential actions.

- Microsoft SQL Server doesn't allow cascading [referential actions](./) on a foreign key, if the relation chain causes a cycle or multiple cascade paths. If the referential actions on the foreign key are set to something other than `NO ACTION` (or `NoAction` if Prisma is managing referential integrity), the server will check for cycles or multiple cascade paths and return an error when executing the SQL.

- With MongoDB, using referential actions in Prisma requires that for any data model with self-referential relations or cycles between three models, you must set the referential action of `NoAction` to prevent the referential action emulations from looping infinitely. Be aware that by default, the `relationMode = "prisma"` mode is used for MongoDB, which means that Prisma manages [referential integrity](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/relation-mode).

Given the SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employee] (
  [id] INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
  [managerId] INT,
  CONSTRAINT [PK__Employee__id] PRIMARY KEY ([id])
);

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employee]
  ADD CONSTRAINT [FK__Employee__managerId]
    FOREIGN KEY ([managerId]) REFERENCES [dbo].[Employee]([id])
    ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

When the SQL is run, the database would throw the following error:

```terminal
Introducing FOREIGN KEY constraint 'FK__Employee__managerId' on table 'Employee' may cause cycles or multiple cascade paths. Specify ON DELETE NO ACTION or ON UPDATE NO ACTION, or modify other FOREIGN KEY constraints.
```

In more complicated data models, finding the cascade paths can get complex. Therefore in Prisma, the data model is validated _before_ generating any SQL to be run during any migrations, highlighting relations that are part of the paths. This makes it much easier to find and break these action chains.

## Self-relation (SQL Server and MongoDB)

The following model describes a self-relation where an `Employee` can have a manager and managees, referencing entries of the same model.

```prisma
model Employee {
  id        Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  manager   Employee?  @relation(name: "management", fields: [managerId], references: [id])
  managees  Employee[] @relation(name: "management")
  managerId Int?
}
```

This will result in the following error:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": A self-relation must have `onDelete` and `onUpdate` referential actions set to `NoAction` in one of the @relation attributes. (Implicit default `onDelete`: `SetNull`, and `onUpdate`: `Cascade`)
```

By not defining any actions, Prisma will use the following default values depending if the underlying [scalar fields](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#scalar-fields) are set to be optional or required.

| Clause     | All of the scalar fields are optional | At least one scalar field is required |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| `onDelete` | `SetNull`                             | `NoAction`                            |
| `onUpdate` | `Cascade`                             | `Cascade`                             |

Since the default referential action for `onUpdate` in the above relation would be `Cascade` and for `onDelete` it would be `SetNull`, it creates a cycle and the solution is to explicitly set the `onUpdate` and `onDelete` values to `NoAction`.

```prisma highlight=3;delete|4;add
model Employee {
  id        Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  manager   Employee   @relation(name: "management", fields: [managerId], references: [id])
  manager   Employee   @relation(name: "management", fields: [managerId], references: [id], onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction)
  managees  Employee[] @relation(name: "management")
  managerId Int
}
```

## Cyclic relation between three tables (SQL Server and MongoDB)

The following models describe a cyclic relation between a `Chicken`, an `Egg` and a `Fox`, where each model references the other.

```prisma
model Chicken {
  id        Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  egg       Egg   @relation(fields: [eggId], references: [id])
  eggId     Int
  predators Fox[]
}

model Egg {
  id         Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  predator   Fox       @relation(fields: [predatorId], references: [id])
  predatorId Int
  parents    Chicken[]
}

model Fox {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  meal      Chicken @relation(fields: [mealId], references: [id])
  mealId    Int
  foodStore Egg[]
}
```

This will result in three validation errors in every relation field that is part of the cycle.

The first one is in the relation `egg` in the `Chicken` model:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": Reference causes a cycle. One of the @relation attributes in this cycle must have `onDelete` and `onUpdate` referential actions set to `NoAction`. Cycle path: Chicken.egg → Egg.predator → Fox.meal. (Implicit default `onUpdate`: `Cascade`)
```

The second one is in the relation `predator` in the `Egg` model:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": Reference causes a cycle. One of the @relation attributes in this cycle must have `onDelete` and `onUpdate` referential actions set to `NoAction`. Cycle path: Egg.predator → Fox.meal → Chicken.egg. (Implicit default `onUpdate`: `Cascade`)
```

And the third one is in the relation `meal` in the `Fox` model:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": Reference causes a cycle. One of the @relation attributes in this cycle must have `onDelete` and `onUpdate` referential actions set to `NoAction`. Cycle path: Fox.meal → Chicken.egg → Egg.predator. (Implicit default `onUpdate`: `Cascade`)
```

As the relation fields are required, the default referential action for `onDelete` is `NoAction` but for `onUpdate` it is `Cascade`, which causes a referential action cycle. The solution is to set the `onUpdate` value to `NoAction` in any one of the relations.

```prisma highlight=3;delete|4;add
model Chicken {
  id        Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  egg       Egg   @relation(fields: [eggId], references: [id])
  egg       Egg   @relation(fields: [eggId], references: [id], onUpdate: NoAction)
  eggId     Int
  predators Fox[]
}
```

or

```prisma highlight=3;delete|4;add
model Egg {
  id         Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  predator   Fox       @relation(fields: [predatorId], references: [id])
  predator   Fox       @relation(fields: [predatorId], references: [id], onUpdate: NoAction)
  predatorId Int
  parents    Chicken[]
}
```

or

```prisma highlight=3;delete|4;add
model Fox {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  meal      Chicken @relation(fields: [mealId], references: [id])
  meal      Chicken @relation(fields: [mealId], references: [id], onUpdate: NoAction)
  mealId    Int
  foodStore Egg[]
}
```

## Multiple cascade paths between two models (SQL Server only)

The data model describes two different paths between same models, with both relations triggering cascading referential actions.

```prisma
model User {
  id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  comments Comment[]
  posts    Post[]
}

model Post {
  id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  authorId Int
  author   User      @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  comments Comment[]
}

model Comment {
  id          Int  @id @default(autoincrement())
  writtenById Int
  postId      Int
  writtenBy   User @relation(fields: [writtenById], references: [id])
  post        Post @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
}
```

The problem in this data model is how there are two paths from `Comment` to the `User`, and how the default `onUpdate` action in both relations is `Cascade`. This leads into two validation errors:

The first one is in the relation `writtenBy`:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": When any of the records in model `User` is updated or deleted, the referential actions on the relations cascade to model `Comment` through multiple paths. Please break one of these paths by setting the `onUpdate` and `onDelete` to `NoAction`. (Implicit default `onUpdate`: `Cascade`)
```

The second one is in the relation `post`:

```terminal
Error parsing attribute "@relation": When any of the records in model `User` is updated or deleted, the referential actions on the relations cascade to model `Comment` through multiple paths. Please break one of these paths by setting the `onUpdate` and `onDelete` to `NoAction`. (Implicit default `onUpdate`: `Cascade`)
```

The error means that by updating a primary key in a record in the `User` model, the update will cascade once between the `Comment` and `User` through the `writtenBy` relation, and again through the `Post` model from the `post` relation due to `Post` being related with the `Comment` model.

The fix is to set the `onUpdate` referential action to `NoAction` in the `writtenBy` or `post` relation fields, or from the `Post` model by changing the actions in the `author` relation:

```prisma highlight=5;delete|6;add
model Comment {
  id          Int  @id @default(autoincrement())
  writtenById Int
  postId      Int
  writtenBy   User @relation(fields: [writtenById], references: [id])
  writtenBy   User @relation(fields: [writtenById], references: [id], onUpdate: NoAction)
  post        Post @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
}
```

or

```prisma highlight=6;delete|7;add
model Comment {
  id          Int  @id @default(autoincrement())
  writtenById Int
  postId      Int
  writtenBy   User @relation(fields: [writtenById], references: [id])
  post        Post @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  post        Post @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id], onUpdate: NoAction)
}
```

or

```prisma highlight=4;delete|5;add
model Post {
  id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  authorId Int
  author   User      @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  author   User      @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onUpdate: NoAction)
  comments Comment[]
}
```
