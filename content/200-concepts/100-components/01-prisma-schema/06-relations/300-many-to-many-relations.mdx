<TopBlock>

Many-to-many (m-n) relations refer to relations where zero or more records on one side of the relation can be connected to zero or more records on the other side.

Prisma schema syntax and the implementation in the underlying database differs between [relational databases](#relational-databases) and [MongoDB](#mongodb).

</TopBlock>

## Relational databases

In relational databases, m-n-relations are typically modelled via [relation tables](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/many-to-many-relations#relation-tables). m-n-relations can be either [explicit](#explicit-many-to-many-relations) or [implicit](#implicit-many-to-many-relations) in the Prisma schema.

### Explicit many-to-many relations

In an explicit many-to-many relation, the **relation table is represented as a model in the Prisma schema** and can be used in queries. Explicit many-to-many relations define three models:

- Two models that have a many-to-many relation, such as `Category` and `Post`
- One model that represents the relation table, such as `CategoriesOnPosts` (also sometimes called _JOIN_, _link_ or _pivot_ table) in the underlying database

In this example, the model representing the relation table **defines additional fields** that describe the `Post`/`Category` relationship - who assigned the category (`assignedBy`), and when the category was assigned (`assignedAt`):

```prisma
model Post {
  id         Int                 @id @default(autoincrement())
  title      String
  categories CategoriesOnPosts[]
}

model Category {
  id    Int                 @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  posts CategoriesOnPosts[]
}

model CategoriesOnPosts {
  post       Post     @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  postId     Int // relation scalar field (used in the `@relation` attribute above)
  category   Category @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id])
  categoryId Int // relation scalar field (used in the `@relation` attribute above)
  assignedAt DateTime @default(now())
  assignedBy String

  @@id([postId, categoryId])
}
```

The underlying SQL looks like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
    "id" SERIAL NOT NULL,
    "title" TEXT NOT NULL,

    CONSTRAINT "Post_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

CREATE TABLE "Category" (
    "id" SERIAL NOT NULL,
    "name" TEXT NOT NULL,

    CONSTRAINT "Category_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);


-- Relation table + indexes --

CREATE TABLE "CategoriesOnPosts" (
    "postId" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "categoryId" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "assignedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "assignedBy" TEXT NOT NULL,

    CONSTRAINT "CategoriesOnPosts_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("postId","categoryId")
);

ALTER TABLE "CategoriesOnPosts" ADD CONSTRAINT "CategoriesOnPosts_postId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("postId") REFERENCES "Post"("id") ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE "CategoriesOnPosts" ADD CONSTRAINT "CategoriesOnPosts_categoryId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("categoryId") REFERENCES "Category"("id") ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

#### Querying an explicit many-to-many

The following section demonstrates how to query an explicit many-to-many relation. You can query the relation model directly (`prisma.categoriesOnPosts(...)`), or use nested queries to go from `Post` -> `CategoriesOnPosts` -> `Category` or the other way.

The following query:

1. Creates a `Post`
2. Creates a category assigment, or `CategoriesOnPosts` (assigned by Bob, assigned today)
3. Creates a new `Category`

```ts
const createCategory = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'How to be Bob',
    categories: {
      create: [
        {
          assignedBy: 'Bob',
          assignedAt: new Date(),
          category: {
            create: {
              name: 'New category',
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

The following query:

- Creates a new `Post`
- Creates a new category assignment, or `CategoriesOnPosts`
- Connects the category assignment to existing categories (with IDs `9` and `22`)

```ts
const assignCategories = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'How to be Bob',
    categories: {
      create: [
        {
          assignedBy: 'Bob',
          assignedAt: new Date(),
          category: {
            connect: {
              id: 9,
            },
          },
        },
        {
          assignedBy: 'Bob',
          assignedAt: new Date(),
          category: {
            connect: {
              id: 22,
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

The following query returns all `Post` records where at least one (`some`) category assignment (`categories`) refers to a category named `"New category"`:

```ts
const getPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    categories: {
      some: {
        category: {
          name: 'New Category',
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The following query returns all categories where at least one (`some`) related `Post` record titles contain the words `"Cool stuff"` _and_ the category was assigned by Bob.

```ts
const getAssignments = await prisma.category.findMany({
  where: {
    posts: {
      some: {
        assignedBy: 'Bob',
        post: {
          title: {
            contains: 'Cool stuff',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The following query gets all category assignments (`CategoriesOnPosts`) records that were assigned by `"Bob"` to one of 5 posts:

```ts
const getAssignments = await prisma.categoriesOnPosts.findMany({
  where: {
    assignedBy: 'Bob',
    post: {
      id: {
        in: [9, 4, 10, 12, 22],
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Implicit many-to-many relations

Implicit many-to-many relations define relation fields as lists on both sides of the relation. Although the relation table exists in the underlying database, **it is managed by Prisma and does not manifest in the Prisma schema**. Implicit relation tables follow a [specific convention](#conventions-for-relation-tables-in-implicit-m-n-relations).

Implicit m-n relations makes the [Prisma Client API](/concepts/components/prisma-client) for many-to-many relations a bit simpler (since you have one fewer level of nesting inside of [nested writes](/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries#nested-writes)).

In the example below, there's one _implicit_ m-n-relation between `Post` and `Category`:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Prisma schema" icon="prisma"/>, <FileWithIcon text="SQL" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma
model Post {
  id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  title      String
  categories Category[]
}

model Category {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  posts Post[]
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```sql
CREATE TABLE "Category" (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL
);
-- Relation table + indexes -------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE "_CategoryToPost" (
    "A" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "Category"(id),
    "B" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "Post"(id)
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_AB_unique" ON "_CategoryToPost"("A" int4_ops,"B" int4_ops);
CREATE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_B_index" ON "_CategoryToPost"("B" int4_ops);
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

#### Querying an implicit many-to-many

The following section demonstrates how to query an implicit many-to-many relation. The queries require less nesting than [explicit many-to-many queries](#querying-an-explicit-many-to-many).

The following query creates a single `Post` and multiple `Category` records:

```ts
const createPostAndCategory = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'How to become a butterfly',
    categories: {
      create: [{ name: 'Magic' }, { name: 'Butterflies' }],
    },
  },
})
```

The following query creates a single `Category` and multiple `Post` records:

```ts
const createCategoryAndPosts = await prisma.category.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Stories',
    posts: {
      create: [
        { title: 'That one time with the stuff' },
        { title: 'The story of planet Earth' },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

The following query returns all `Post` records with a list of that post's assigned categories:

```ts
const getPostsAndCategories = await prisma.post.findMany({
  include: {
    categories: true,
  },
})
```

#### Rules for defining an implicit m-n relation

Implicit m-n relations:

- Use a specific [convention for relation tables](#conventions-for-relation-tables-in-implicit-m-n-relations)
- Do **not** require the `@relation` attribute unless you need to [disambiguate relations](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations#disambiguating-relations) with a name, e.g. `@relation("MyRelation")` or `@relation(name: "MyRelation")`.
- If you do use the `@relation` attribute, you cannot use the `references`, `fields`, `onUpdate` or `onDelete` arguments. This is because these take a fixed value for implicit m-n relations and cannot be changed.
- Require both models to have a single `@id`. Be aware that:

  - You cannot use a [multi-field ID](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#id-1)
  - You cannot use a `@unique` in place of an `@id`

  <Admonition type="info">

  To use either of these features, you must use an [explicit many-to-many instead](#explicit-many-to-many-relations).

  </Admonition>

#### Conventions for relation tables in implicit m-n relations

If you obtain your data model from [introspection](/concepts/components/introspection), you can still use implicit many-to-many relations by following Prisma's [conventions for relation tables](#conventions-for-relation-tables-in-implicit-m-n-relations).
The following example assumes you want to create a relation table to get an implicit many-to-many relation for two models called `Post` and `Category`.

##### Table names

If you want a relation table to be picked up by introspection as an implicit many-to-many relation, the name must follow this exact structure:

- It must start with an underscore `_`
- Then the name of the first table in alphabetical order (in this case `Category`)
- Then `To`
- Then the name of the second table in alphabetical order (in this case `Post`)

In the example, the correct table name is `_CategoryToPost`.

When creating an implicit many-to-many relation yourself in the Prisma schema file, you can [configure the relation](#configuring-the-name-of-the-relation-table-in-implicit-many-to-many-relations) to have a different name. This will change the name given to the relation table in the database. For example, for a relation named `"MyRelation"` the corresponding table will be called `_MyRelation`.

##### Columns

A relation table for an implicit-many-to-many relation must have exactly two columns:

- A foreign key column that points to `Category` called `A`
- A foreign key column that points to `Post` called `B`

The columns must be called `A` and `B` where `A` points to the model that comes first in the alphabet and `B` points to the model which comes last in the alphabet.

##### Indexes

There further must be:

- A unique index defined on both foreign key columns:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_AB_unique" ON "_CategoryToPost"("A" int4_ops,"B" int4_ops);
```

- A non-unique index defined on B:

```sql
CREATE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_B_index" ON "_CategoryToPost"("B" int4_ops);
```

##### Example

This is a sample SQL statement that would create the three tables including indexes (in PostgreSQL dialect) that are picked up as a implicit many-to-many relation by Prisma Introspection:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "_CategoryToPost" (
    "A" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "Category"(id) ,
    "B" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "Post"(id)
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_AB_unique" ON "_CategoryToPost"("A" int4_ops,"B" int4_ops);
CREATE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_B_index" ON "_CategoryToPost"("B" int4_ops);

CREATE TABLE "Category" (
    id integer SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE "Post" (
    id integer SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
);
```

#### Configuring the name of the relation table in implicit many-to-many relations

When using Prisma Migrate, you can configure the name of the relation table that's managed by Prisma using the `@relation` attribute. For example, if you want the relation table to be called `_MyRelationTable` instead of the default name `_CategoryToPost`, you can specify it as follows:

```prisma
model Post {
  id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  categories Category[] @relation("MyRelationTable")
}

model Category {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[] @relation("MyRelationTable")
}
```

### Relation tables

A relation table (also sometimes called _JOIN_, _link_ or _pivot_ table) connects two or more other tables and therefore creates a _relation_ between them. Creating relation tables is a common data modeling practice in SQL to represent relationships between different entities. In essence it means that "one m-n relation is modeled as two 1-n relations in the database".

When using Prisma, you can create relation tables by defining [models](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-models) similar to how you would model them as tables. The main difference is that the fields of the relation table are both annotated relation fields with a corresponding relation scalar field.

Relation tables are also often used to add "meta-information" to a relation. For example, to store _when_ the relation was created.

Here is an example for a relation table called `CategoriesOnPosts`:

```prisma
model Post {
  id         Int                 @id @default(autoincrement())
  title      String
  categories CategoriesOnPosts[]
}

model Category {
  id    Int                 @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  posts CategoriesOnPosts[]
}

model CategoriesOnPosts {
  post       Post     @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  postId     Int
  category   Category @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id])
  categoryId Int
  assignedAt DateTime @default(now())
  assignedBy String

  @@id([postId, categoryId])
}
```

In this example, the `assignedAt` field stores additional information about the relation between `Post` and `Category`:

- `assignedAt` stores _when_ the post was added to the category
- `assignedBy` store _who_ added the post to the category

Note that the same rules as for [1-n-relations](one-to-many-relations) apply (because `Post`↔ `CategoriesOnPosts` and `Category` ↔ `CategoriesOnPosts` are both in fact 1-n-relations), which means one side of the relation needs to be annotated with the `@relation` attribute.

When you don't need to attach additional information to the relation, you can model m-n-relations as [implicit many-to-many relations](#implicit-many-to-many-relations). If you're not using Prisma Migrate but obtain your data model from [introspection](/concepts/components/introspection), you can still make use of implicit many-to-many relations by following Prisma's [conventions for relation tables](#conventions-for-relation-tables-in-implicit-m-n-relations).

## MongoDB

In MongoDB, many-to-many relations are represented by:

- relation fields on both sides, that each have a `@relation` attribute, with mandatory `fields` and `references` arguments
- a scalar list of referenced IDs on each side, with a type that matches the ID field on the other side

The following example demonstrates a many-to-many relation between posts and categories:

```prisma
model Post {
  id          String     @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  categoryIDs String[]   @db.ObjectId
  categories  Category[] @relation(fields: [categoryIDs], references: [id])
}

model Category {
  id      String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  name    String
  postIDs String[] @db.ObjectId
  posts   Post[]   @relation(fields: [postIDs], references: [id])
}
```

Prisma validates many-to-many relations in MongoDB with the following rules:

- The fields on both sides of the relation must have a list type (in the example above, `categories` have a type of `Category[]` and `posts` have a type of `Post[]`)
- The `@relation` attribute must define `fields` and `references` arguments on both sides
- The `fields` argument must have only one scalar field defined, which must be of a list type
- The `references` argument must have only one scalar field defined. This scalar field must exist on the referenced model and must be of the same type as the scalar field in the `fields` argument, but singular (no list)
- The scalar field to which `references` points must have the `@id` attribute
- No [referential actions](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/referential-actions) are allowed in `@relation`

The implicit many-to-many relations [used in relational databases](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations) are not supported on MongoDB.

### Querying MongoDB many-to-many relations

This section demonstrates how to query many-to-many relations in MongoDB, using the example schema above.

The following query finds posts with specific matching category IDs:

```ts
const newId1 = new ObjectId()
const newId2 = new ObjectId()

const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    categoryIDs: {
      hasSome: [newId1.toHexString(), newId2.toHexString()],
    },
  },
})
```

The following query finds posts where the category name contains the string `'Servers'`:

```ts
const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    categories: {
      some: {
        name: {
          contains: 'Servers',
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```
