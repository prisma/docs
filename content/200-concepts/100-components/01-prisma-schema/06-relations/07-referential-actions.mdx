<TopBlock>

In [2.26.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.26.0) and later, you can define **referential actions** on your relation fields. Referential actions determine what should happen to a record when a related record is deleted or updated. 

<Admonition type="warning">

Referential actions are currently a **Preview feature**.

</Admonition>

In the following example, adding `onDelete: Cascade` to the `author` field on the `Post` model means that deleting the `User` record will also delete all related `Post` records.

```prisma highlight=4;normal
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

If you do not specify a referential action, Prisma [uses a default](#referential-action-defaults).

</TopBlock>

## Enable the <inlinecode>referentialActions</inlinecode> Preview feature

Referential actions are a preview feature. To enable the `referentialActions` preview feature:

1. [Upgrade to Prisma version 2.26.0](../../../../guides/upgrade-guides/upgrading-to-latest).
2. Add `referentialActions` to the `previewFeatures` field of the Prisma Client [`generator`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#generator) block in the `prisma.schema` file:

  ```prisma file=schema.prisma
  generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
    previewFeatures = ["referentialActions"]
  }
  ```

3. Follow the [upgrade paths for referential actions](#upgrade-paths).

<Admonition type="alert">

It is extremely important that you check the [upgrade paths for referential actions](#upgrade-paths) section before you continue. The `referentialAction` Preview feature **removes the safety net in Prisma Client that prevents cascading deletes at runtime**. If you enable the feature _without upgrading your database_, the [old default action](#the-2250-default-referential-actions) - `ON DELETE CASCADE` - becomes active. This may result in cascading deletes that you did not expect.

</Admonition>

## What are referential actions?

Referential actions are policies that define how a referenced record is handled by the database when you run an [`update`](../../prisma-client/crud#update) or [`delete`](../../prisma-client/crud#delete) query.

<details><summary>Referential actions on the database level</summary> 

Referential actions are features of foreign key constraints that exist to preserve referential integrity in your database. 

When you define relationships between data models in your prisma schema, you use [relation fields](./#relation-fields), **which do not exist on the database**, and [scalar fields](../data-model/#scalar-fields), **which do exist on the database**. These foreign keys connect the models on the database level. 

Referential integrity states that these foreign keys must reference an existing primary key value in the related database table. In your prisma schema, this is generally represented by the `id` field on the related model.

By default a database will reject any operation that violates the referential integrity, for example, by deleting referenced records. 

</details>


### How to use referential actions
  
Referential actions are defined in the [`@relation`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#relation) attribute and map to the actions on the **foreign key constraint** in the underlying database. If you do not specify a referential action, [Prisma falls back to a default](#referential-action-defaults).

The following model defines a 1-m relation between `User` and `Post` and a n-m relation between `Post` and `Tag`, with explicitly defined referential actions:

```prisma highlight=10,16-17;normal
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id     Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  title  String
  tags   TagOnPosts[]
  User   User?         @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull, onUpdate: Cascade)
  userId Int?
}

model TagOnPosts {
  id     Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  post   Post? @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id], onUpdate: Cascade, onDelete: Cascade)
  tag    Tag?  @relation(fields: [tagId], references: [id], onUpdate: Cascade, onDelete: Cascade)
  postId Int?
  tagId  Int?
}

model Tag {
  id    Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String        @unique
  posts TagOnPosts[]
}
```

* If you delete a `Tag`, the corresponding tag assignment is also deleted `TagOnPost` (`Cascade`)
* If you delete a `User`, the author is removed from all posts (`SetNull`) - `User` and `userId` must be optional

Prisma supports the following referential actions:

- [`Cascade`](#cascade)
- [`Restrict`](#restrict)
- [`NoAction`](#noaction)
- [`SetNull`](#setnull)
- [`SetDefault`](#setdefault)

### Referential action defaults

If you do not specify a referential action, Prisma uses the following defaults:

| Clause     | Optional relations | Mandatory relations |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| `onDelete` | `SetNull`          | `Restrict`          |
| `onUpdate` | `Cascade`          | `Cascade`           |

For example - in the following schema, all `Post` records must be connected to an `author`. The schema **does not explicitly define referential actions** on the `author` field, which means that default referential actions apply (see SQL tab):

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="schema.prisma" icon="prisma"/>, <FileWithIcon text="SQL" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma highlight=4;normal
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id    Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```sql highlight=5;normal
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
  "id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  "title" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "authorId" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY ("authorId") REFERENCES "User" ("id") ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE "User" (
  "id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
);
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

## Caveats

The following caveats apply:

*  Referential actions are **not** supported on [implicit many-to-many relations](./#implicit-vs-explicit-many-to-many-relations). To use referential actions, you must define an explicit many-to-many relation and define your referential actions on the [join table](./#how-to-use-a-relation-table-with-a-many-to-many-relationship).

## Types of referential actions

The following table shows which referential action each database supports. 

<Admonition type="info">

Note that [`NoAction`](#noaction) can be used in replace of [`Restrict`](#restrict) when working with an SQLServer database.

</Admonition>

| Database   | Cascade | Restrict | NoAction |  SetNull | SetDefault  |
| :--------- | :------ | :------- | :------- | :------- | :---------- |
| PostgreSQL | **✔️**  | **✔️**  | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**     |
| MySQL      | **✔️**  | **✔️**  | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**     |
| SQLite     | **✔️**  | **✔️**  | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**     |
| SQLServer  | **✔️**  | **❌**  | **✔️**  | **✔️**   | **✔️**     |

### Cascade

- `onDelete: Cascade` Deleting a referenced record will trigger the deletion of referencing record.

- `onUpdate: Cascade` Updates the relation scalar fields if the referenced scalar fields of the dependant record are updated.

#### Example usage

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `Cascade`

If a `User` record is deleted, then their posts are deleted too. If the user's `id` is updated, then the corresponding `authorId` is also updated.

</div>

### Restrict

- `onDelete: Restrict` Prevents the deletion if any referencing records exist.

- `onUpdate: Restrict` Prevents the identifier of a referenced record from being changed.

#### Example usage

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict, onUpdate: Restrict)
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `Restrict`

`User`'s with posts **cannot** be deleted. The `Post`'s `id` **cannot** be changed.

<Admonition type="warning">

The `Restrict` action is **not** available on [SQL Server](../../../database-connectors/microsoft-sql-server) and will trigger a schema validation error. Instead, you can use [`NoAction`](#noaction), which produces the same result and is compatible with SQLServer.

</Admonition>

### NoAction

The `NoAction` action is similar to `Restrict`, the difference between the two is dependant on the database being used:

- **PostgreSQL**: `NoAction` allows the check (if a referenced row on the table exists) to be deferred until later in the transaction. See [the PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-FK) for more information.
- **MySQL**: `NoAction` behaves exactly the same as `Restrict`. See [the MySQL docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html#foreign-key-referential-actions) for more information.
- **SQLite**: When a related primary key is modified or deleted, no action is taken. See [the SQLite docs](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions) for more information.
- **SQLServer**: When a referenced record is deleted or modified, an error is raised. See [the SQLServer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/graph-edge-constraints?view=sql-server-ver15#on-delete-referential-actions-on-edge-constraints) for more information.

#### Example usage

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction)
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

### SetNull

- `onDelete: SetNull` The scalar field of the referenced object will be set to `NULL`.

- `onUpdate: SetNull` When updating the identifier of a referenced object, the scalar fields of the referencing objects will be set to `NULL`.

If one or more of the relations scalar fields are required a runtime error will be thrown.

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull, onUpdate: SetNull)
  authorId  Int?
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `SetNull`?

When deleting a `User`, the `authorId` will be set to `NULL` for all its authored posts. 

When changing a `User`'s `id`, the `authorId` will be set to `NULL` for all its authored posts. 

### SetDefault

- `onDelete: SetDefault` The scalar field of the referencing object will be set to the fields default value.

- `onUpdate: SetDefault` The scalar field of the referencing object will be set to the fields default value.

These require setting a default for the relation scalar field with [`@default`](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#default). If no defaults are provided for any of the scalar fields, a runtime error will be thrown.

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4,5;add
model Post {
  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title       String
  authorName  String  @default("anonymous")
  author      User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: SetDefault, onUpdate: SetDefault)
  authorId    Int?
}

model User {
  username  String  @id
  posts     Post[]
}
```

##### Result of using `SetDefault`

When deleting a `User`, its existing authored posts will now be authored by a `User` with `id` "anonymous". 

When the `username` of a `User` changes, its existing authored posts will now be authored by `User` with `username` "anonymous".

## Upgrade paths

There are a couple of paths you can take when upgrading which will give different results depending on the desired outcome.

The following assumes you have upgraded to 2.26.0 and [enabled the preview feature flag](#enable-the-referentialactions-preview-feature).

### Using Introspection

If you [Introspect](../introspection) your database **before modifying your data model**, the referential actions configured at the database level will be reflected in your Prisma Schema. If you have been using Prisma Migrate or `prisma db push` to manage the database schema, these are likely to be the [<=2.25.0 default values](#the-2250-default-referential-actions). 

Of note is the default value of `onDelete`, which <=2.25.0 is `Cascade` (Assuming you haven't manually altered it via a [`$raw`](../../prisma-client/raw-database-access) SQL query and have been using the defaults). 

When you run an Introspection, Prisma compares all the foreign keys in the database with the schema, if the SQL statements `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` do **not** match the default values, they will be explicitly set in the schema file.

#### A blog schema example

```prisma highlight=4;add
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

<Admonition type="alert">

If you are using either the [`delete()`](../../../../guides/database/advanced-database-tasks/cascading-deletes/postgresql#91-validating-restrict) or [`deleteAll()`](../../prisma-client/crud#delete-all-records) methods, **[cascading deletes](#how-to-use-cascading-deletes) will now be performed** as the `referentialAction` preview feature **removed the safety net in Prisma Client that previously prevented cascading deletes at runtime**. Be sure to check your code and make any adjustments accordingly.

</Admonition>

### Using Migration

When running a [Migration](../../prisma-migrate) (or the [`prisma db push`](../../prisma-migrate/db-push) command) the [new defaults](#referential-action-defaults) will be applied to your database.

<Admonition type="info">

Unlike when you run an Introspect for the first time, the new referential actions clause and property, will **not** automatically be addded to your prisma schema by the Prisma VSCode extension. 
You will have to manually add them if you wish to use anything other than the new defaults.

</Admonition>

Using referential actions is optional and you are not required to add them to your prisma schema. If you choose to omit them, the [new defaults](#referential-action-defaults) will be used. 

Note that referential actions can be added on a case by case basis. This means that you can add them to one single relation and leave the rest set to the defaults by not manually specifying anything.

## Behavior in <=2.25.0 or without preview flag <inlinecode>referentialActions</inlinecode>

<a id="current"></a>

The following behavior applies in 2.25.0 and earlier, and since 2.26.0 _without_ the `referentialActions` preview flag.

When invoking the [`delete()`](../../../../guides/database/advanced-database-tasks/cascading-deletes/postgresql#91-validating-restrict) or [`deleteAll()`](../../prisma-client/crud#delete-all-records) methods using the Prisma Client on required relations, a runtime check is performed and the deletion of records prevented if they are referencing related objects. **This prevents cascade behavior**.

The current behavior, without upgrading and enabling the feature flag, does not allow setting referential actions at all. 

### The <=2.25.0 default referential actions

| Clause     | Optional relations | Mandatory relations |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| `onDelete` | `SetNull`          | `Cascade`           |
| `onUpdate` | `Cascade`          | `Cascade`           |

If you need to actually use the cascade behavior configured in the database, you _can_ use [`$raw`](../../prisma-client/raw-database-access) SQL queries to [delete multiple referenced records](../../prisma-client/crud#deleting-all-data-with-raw-sql--truncate) (such as users blog posts) and the deletion will be successful. This is because the Prisma Client will **not** perform runtime checks on raw queries.
