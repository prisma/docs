Modelling your schema can sometimes offer up some unexpected results. This section aims to cover the most prominent of those.

## Many-to-many self relations return incorrect data

```prisma
model Post {
  id                       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title                    String
  postsRelatedToThisPost   Post[] @relation(name: "RelatedPosts")
  postsThisPostIsRelatedTo Post[] @relation(name: "RelatedPosts")
}
```

## How to use a relation table with a many-to-many relationship

There are a couple of ways to define a m-n relationship, implicitly or explicity. Implicitly means letting Prisma handle the relation table (JOIN table) under the hood, all you have to do is define an array/list for the non scalar types on each model, see [implicit many-to-many relations](many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations).

Where you might run into trouble is when creating an [explicit m-n relationship](many-to-many-relations#explicit-many-to-many-relations), that is, to create and handle the relation table yourself. **It can be overlooked that Prisma requires both sides of the relation to be present**.

Take the following example, here a relation table is created to act as the JOIN between the `Post` and `Category` tables. This will not work however as the relation table (`PostCategories`) must form a 1-to-many relationship with the other two models respectively.

The back relation fields are missing from the `Post` to `PostCategories` and `Category` to `PostCategories` models.

```prisma

// This example schema shows how NOT to define an explicit m-n relation

model Post {
  id            Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  title         String
  categories    Category[] // This should refer to PostCategories
}

model PostCategories {
  post          Post        @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  postId        Int
  category      Category    @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id])
  categoryId    Int
  @@id([postId, categoryId])
}

model Category {
  id             Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  name           String
  posts          Post[] // This should refer to PostCategories
}
```

To fix this the `Post` model needs to have a many relation field defined with the relation table `PostCategories`. The same applies to the `Category` model.

This is because the relation model forms a 1-to-many relationship with the other two models its joining.

```prisma highlight=5,20;add|4,19;delete
model Post {
  id              Int               @id @default(autoincrement())
  title           String
  categories      Category[]
  postCategories  PostCategories[]
}

model PostCategories {
  post          Post                @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  postId        Int
  category      Category            @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id])
  categoryId    Int
  @@id([postId, categoryId])
}

model Category {
  id              Int                @id @default(autoincrement())
  name            String
  posts           Post[]
  postCategories  PostCategories[]
}
```

## Using the <inlinecode>@relation</inlinecode> attribute with a many-to-many relationship

It might seem logical to add a `@relation("Post")` annotation to a relation field on your model when composing an implicit many-to-many relationship.

```prisma
model Post {
  id            Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  title         String
  categories    Category[]  @relation("Category")
}

model Category {
  id             Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name           String
  posts          Post[]   @relation("Post")
}
```

This however tells Prisma to expect **two** separate many-to-many relationships. See [disambiguating relations](../relations#disambiguating-relations) for more information on using the `@relation` attribute.

The following example is the correct way to define an implicit many-to-many relationship.

```prisma highlight=4,11;delete|5,12;add
model Post {
  id            Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  title         String
  categories    Category[]  @relation("Category")
  categories    Category[]
}

model Category {
  id             Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name           String
  posts          Post[]   @relation("Post")
  posts          Post[]
}
```

The `@relation` annotation can also be used to name the underlying relation table created on a implicit m-n relationship.

```prisma
model Post {
  id            Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  title         String
  categories    Category[]  @relation("CategoryPostRelation")
}

model Category {
  id            Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  name          String
  posts         Post[]      @relation("CategoryPostRelation")
}
```
