From version `3.5.0` onwards, Prisma will allow configuration of indexes, unique constraints and primary keys constraints using extended syntax options in the Prisma schema language. Two new arguments, `length` and `sort`, can now be specified in the `@id`, `@@id`, `@unique`, `@@unique` and `@@index` fields in certain databases:

- The `length` argument is available on MySQL on the `@id`, `@@id`, `@unique`, `@@unique` and `@@index` fields. It allows Prisma to now support indexes and constraints on `String` and `Bytes` types.

- The `sort` argument is available for all databases on the `@unique`, `@@unique` and `@@index` fields. Additionally, SQL Server also allows it on `@id` and `@@id`.

<Admonition type="warning">

This might be a **breaking change** if you have a database that is already making use of these features, so it needs to be explicitly enabled via a Preview feature. See [Upgrading from previous versions](#upgrading-from-previous-versions) for details.

</Admonition>

In order to enable this as a Preview feature please add it to the `generator` block:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["extendedIndexes"]
}
```

## New `length` argument (MySQL)

The `length` argument is specific to MySQL and will allow you to define indexes and constraints on columns of `String` and `Byte` types. For these types, MySQL requires you to specify a maximum length for the subpart of the value to be indexed in cases where the full value would exceed MySQL's limits for index sizes. See [the MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-limits.html) for more details.

The `length` argument is available on the `@id`, `@@id`, `@unique`, `@@unique` and `@@index` fields.

As an example, the following data model declares a field with a max length of 3000 characters as id.

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Id {
  id String @id @db.VarChar(3000)
}
```

But this is not not valid in MySQL because it exceeds MySQL's index storage limit and therefore Prisma rejects the data model. The generated SQL would be rejected by the database.

```sql
Create Table `Id` (
`id` varchar(3000) Primary Key
)
```

With the new `length` property you can now specify that a subpart of the `id` value represents the primary key. In the example below the first 100 characters are used:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Id {
  id String @id(length: 100) @db.VarChar(3000)
}
```

Migrate is able to create constraints and indexes with these length arguments if specified in your data model. This means that you can now create indexes and constraints on values of Prisma type `Byte` and `String`. If you don't specify the argument the index is treated as covering the full value as before.

Introspection will now fetch these limits where they are present in your existing database. This allows us to support indexes and constraints that were previously suppressed and will result in better support of existing MySQL databases that were making use of this feature.

The `length` argument can also be used on compound primary keys, using the `@@id` field, as in the example below:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model CompoundId {
  id_1 String @db.VarChar(3000)
  id_2 String @db.VarChar(3000)

  @@id([id_1(length: 100),id_2(length: 10) ])
}
```

## New `sort` argument

The `sort` argument is available for all databases supported by Prisma. It allows you to specify in what order the entries of the index or constraint are stored in the database. This can have an effect on whether the database is able to use an index for specific queries.

The `sort` argument is available for all databases on `@unique`, `@@unique` and `@@index`. Additionally, SQL Server also allows it on `@id` and `@@id`.

As an example, the following table

```sql
Create Table `Unique` (
`unique` Int,
Unique Constraint `unique` Desc
)
```

will now be introspected as

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Unique {
  unique Int @unique(sort: Desc)
}
```

The `sort` argument can also be used on compound indexes:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model CompoundUnique {
  unique_1 Int
  unique_2 Int

  @@unique([unique_1(sort: Desc),unique_2])
}
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates the use of the `sort` and `length` arguments to configure indexes and constraints for a `Post` model:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Post {
  title      String   @db.VarChar(300)
  abstract   String   @db.VarChar(3000)
  slug       String   @unique(sort: Desc, length: 42) @db.VarChar(3000)
  author     String
  created_at DateTime

  @@id([title(length: 100, sort: Desc), abstract(length: 10)])
  @@index([author, created_at(sort: Desc)])
}
```

## Upgrading from previous versions

<Admonition type="warning">

This is a **breaking change** when updating from certain existing databases. After updating, always run `prisma db pull` to introspect the existing database before migrating.

</Admonition>

A breaking change can occur in the following situations:

- **Existing sort constraints and indexes:** earlier versions of Prisma will assume that the desired sort order is _ascending_ if no order is specified explicitly. This means that this is a breaking change if you have existing constraints or indexes that are using descending sort order and migrate your database without first specifying this in your data model.
- **Existing length constraints and indexes:** in earlier versions of Prisma, indexes and constaints that were length constrained in MySQL could not be represented in the Prisma schema. Therefore `prisma db pull` was not fetching these and you could not manually specify them. When you ran `prisma db push` or `prisma migrate dev` they were ignored if already present in your database. Since you are now able to specify these, migrate commands will now drop them if they are missing from your data model but present in the database.

In both of the cases above unwanted changes to your database can be prevented by properly specifying these properties in your data model where necessary. **The easiest way to do this is to use `prisma db pull` to retrieve the sort and length arguments where applicable.** Alternatively, you could also add these arguments manually. This should be done before using `prisma db push` or `prisma migrate dev`.
