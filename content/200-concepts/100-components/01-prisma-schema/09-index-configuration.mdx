From version `3.5.0` onwards, Prisma allows configuration of indexes, unique constraints and primary keys constraints using extended syntax options in the Prisma schema language. Two new arguments, `length` and `sort`, can be specified in the `@id`, `@@id`, `@unique`, `@@unique` and `@@index` fields in certain databases:

- The `length` argument is available on MySQL on the `@id`, `@@id`, `@unique`, `@@unique` and `@@index` fields. It allows Prisma to support indexes and constraints on `String` and `Bytes` types.

- The `sort` argument is available for all databases on the `@unique`, `@@unique` and `@@index` fields. Additionally, SQL Server also allows it on `@id` and `@@id`.

To enable this preview feature, add it to the `generator` block of the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["extendedIndexes"]
}
```

From version `3.6.0` onwards, there will also be a new `@@fulltext` attribute available as a preview feature. This provides support for introspection and migration of fulltext indexes in MySQL and MongoDB. To enable this preview feature, add it to the `generator` block of the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextIndex"]
}
```

These might be **breaking changes** if you have a database that is already making use of these features, so they need to be explicitly enabled via preview features. See [Upgrading from previous versions](#upgrading-from-previous-versions) for details.

## Index configuration

This section provides more details on new index configuration options enabled by the `extendedIndexes` preview feature.

### New `length` argument (MySQL)

The `length` argument is specific to MySQL and will allow you to define indexes and constraints on columns of `String` and `Byte` types. For these types, MySQL requires you to specify a maximum length for the subpart of the value to be indexed in cases where the full value would exceed MySQL's limits for index sizes. See [the MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-limits.html) for more details.

The `length` argument is available on the `@id`, `@@id`, `@unique`, `@@unique` and `@@index` fields.

As an example, the following data model declares a field with a max length of 3000 characters as id.

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Id {
  id String @id @db.VarChar(3000)
}
```

But this is not not valid in MySQL because it exceeds MySQL's index storage limit and therefore Prisma rejects the data model. The generated SQL would be rejected by the database.

```sql
Create Table `Id` (
`id` varchar(3000) Primary Key
)
```

With the new `length` property you can now specify that a subpart of the `id` value represents the primary key. In the example below the first 100 characters are used:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Id {
  id String @id(length: 100) @db.VarChar(3000)
}
```

Prisma Migrate is able to create constraints and indexes with these length arguments if specified in your data model. This means that you can create indexes and constraints on values of Prisma type `Byte` and `String`. If you don't specify the argument the index is treated as covering the full value as before.

Introspection will fetch these limits where they are present in your existing database. This allows Prisma to support indexes and constraints that were previously suppressed and will result in better support of existing MySQL databases that are making use of this feature.

The `length` argument can also be used on compound primary keys, using the `@@id` field, as in the example below:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model CompoundId {
  id_1 String @db.VarChar(3000)
  id_2 String @db.VarChar(3000)

  @@id([id_1(length: 100),id_2(length: 10)])
}
```

A similar syntax can be used for the `@@unique` and `@@index` fields.

### New `sort` argument

The `sort` argument is available for all databases supported by Prisma. It allows you to specify in what order the entries of the index or constraint are stored in the database. This can have an effect on whether the database is able to use an index for specific queries.

The `sort` argument is available for all databases on `@unique`, `@@unique` and `@@index`. Additionally, SQL Server also allows it on `@id` and `@@id`.

As an example, the following table

```sql
Create Table `Unique` (
`unique` Int,
Unique Constraint `unique` Desc
)
```

will now be introspected as

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Unique {
  unique Int @unique(sort: Desc)
}
```

The `sort` argument can also be used on compound indexes:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model CompoundUnique {
  unique_1 Int
  unique_2 Int

  @@unique([unique_1(sort: Desc),unique_2])
}
```

### Example: using `sort` and `length` together

The following example demonstrates the use of the `sort` and `length` arguments to configure indexes and constraints for a `Post` model:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Post {
  title      String   @db.VarChar(300)
  abstract   String   @db.VarChar(3000)
  slug       String   @unique(sort: Desc, length: 42) @db.VarChar(3000)
  author     String
  created_at DateTime

  @@id([title(length: 100, sort: Desc), abstract(length: 10)])
  @@index([author, created_at(sort: Desc)])
}
```

## Fulltext indexes (MySQL and MongoDB)

In version 3.6.0 and later, a new `@@fulltext` attribute is available as a preview feature. This provides support for introspection and migration of fulltext indexes in MySQL and MongoDB. Existing fulltext indexes in the database will be added to your Prisma schema after introspecting with `db push`, and new fulltext indexes added in the schema will be created in the database on migration. This also prevents validation errors in some database schemas that were not working before.

For now we do not enable the full-text search commands in the Prisma Client. They will be implemented separately, and the progress can be followed in the MongoDB and MySQL issues.

The following example demonstrates adding a `@@fulltext` index to the `title` and `content` fields of a `Post` model:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Post {
  id      Int    @id
  title   String @db.VarChar(255)
  content String @db.Text

  @@fulltext([title, content])
}
```

On MongoDB, the `fullTextIndex` preview feature can be combined with the `extendedIndexes` preview feature to add ascending or descending columns to your full-text index:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator js {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextIndex", "extendedIndexes", "mongoDb"]
}

model Post {
  id      String @id @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  title   String @db.VarChar(255)
  content String @db.Text

  @@fulltext([title(sort: Desc), content])
}
```

## Upgrading from previous versions

<Admonition type="warning">

These are **breaking changes** when updating from certain existing databases. After updating, always run `prisma db pull` to introspect the existing database before migrating.

</Admonition>

### Upgrading with existing `sort` and `length` constraints and indexes

A breaking change can occur in the following situations:

- **Existing sort constraints and indexes:** earlier versions of Prisma will assume that the desired sort order is _ascending_ if no order is specified explicitly. This means that this is a breaking change if you have existing constraints or indexes that are using descending sort order and migrate your database without first specifying this in your data model.
- **Existing length constraints and indexes:** in earlier versions of Prisma, indexes and constaints that were length constrained in MySQL could not be represented in the Prisma schema. Therefore `prisma db pull` was not fetching these and you could not manually specify them. When you ran `prisma db push` or `prisma migrate dev` they were ignored if already present in your database. Since you are now able to specify these, migrate commands will now drop them if they are missing from your data model but present in the database.

In both of the cases above unwanted changes to your database can be prevented by properly specifying these properties in your data model where necessary. **The easiest way to do this is to use `prisma db pull` to retrieve the sort and length arguments where applicable.** Alternatively, you could also add these arguments manually. This should be done before using `prisma db push` or `prisma migrate dev`.

### Upgrading with existing fulltext indexes

Earlier versions of Prisma converted fulltext indexes using the `@@index` attribute rather than the `@@fulltext` attribute. After enabling the `fullTextIndex` preview feature, run `prisma db pull` to convert these indexes to `@fulltext` before migrating.
