title: Supporting features without a PSL equivalent
metaDescription: How to support database features that do not have an equivalent syntax in Prisma Schema Language.
---

<TopBlock>

Not all database functions and features have a Prisma Schema Language equivalent. Refer to the [database features matrix](../../../reference/database-reference/database-features) for a complete list of supported features.

<Admonition type="warning">

**Not supported by the MongoDB connector**<br />
The MongoDB connector does not support the `Unsupported` field type, and MongoDB does not have the concept of database-level functions. `dbgenerated()` is used exclusively to generate `ObjectId` values.

## Native database functions

Prisma Schema Language supports several [functions](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#attribute-functions) that you can use to set the default value of a field. The following example uses the Prisma-level `uuid()` function to set the value of the `id` field:

```prisma
model Post {
  id    String   @id @default(uuid())
}
```

However, you can also use **native database functions** to define default values with [`dbgenerated()`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#dbgenerated) <span class="api"></span>. The following example uses the PostgreSQL `gen_random_uuid()` function to populate the `id` field:

```prisma
model User {
  id   String  @id @db.Uuid @default(dbgenerated("gen_random_uuid()"))
}
```

### When to use a database-level function

There are two reasons to use a database-level function:

- There is no equivalent Prisma function (for example, `gen_random_bytes` in PostgreSQL).
- You cannot or do not want to rely on functions such `uuid()` and `cuid()`, which are only implemented at Prisma level and do not manifest in the database.

  Consider the following example, which sets the `id` field to a randomly generated `UUID`:

  ```prisma
  model Post {
      id    String      @id @default(uuid())
  }
  ```

  The UUID is _only_ generated if you use Prisma Client to create the `Post`. If you create posts in any other way, such as a bulk import script written in plain SQL, you must generate the UUID yourself.

### Enable extensions for native database functions

Some native database functions are part an extension. For example, `gen_random_uuid()` is part of the [`pgcrypto`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/pgcrypto.html) module, and the `@db.Citext` native type attribute expects the `citext` extension. You must install the extension in order to use any functions or features:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
```

If your project uses [Prisma Migrate](../prisma-migrate), you must [install the extension as part of a migration](../../../guides/database/developing-with-prisma-migrate/enable-native-database-functions) <span class="guide"></span>. Do not install the extension manually, as it is also required by shadow database.

Prisma Migrate returns the following error if the extension is not available:

```
Migration `20210221102106_faild_migration` failed to apply cleanly to a temporary database.
Database error: Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: type "pgcrypto" does not exist
```

## Unsupported field types

Some database types, such as `polygon` or `geometry`, do not have a Prisma Schema Language equivalent. Use the [`Unsupported`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#unsupported) <span class="api"></span> field type to represent the field in your Prisma schema:

```prisma highlight=3;normal
model Star {
  id           Int                      @id @default(autoincrement())
  position     Unsupported("circle")?   @default(dbgenerated("'<(10,4),11>'::circle"))
}
```

The `prisma migrate dev` and `prisma db push` command will both create a `position` field of type `circle` in the database. However, the field will not be available in the generated Prisma Client.

## Unsupported database features

Some features, like SQL views or partial indexes, cannot be represented in the Prisma schema. If your project uses [Prisma Migrate](../prisma-migrate), you must [include unsupported features as part of a migration](../../../guides/database/developing-with-prisma-migrate/include-unsupported-database-features) <span class="guide"></span>.
