<TopBlock>

A generator determines which assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command, including:

- The **Prisma client (language specific)** (currently only `prisma-client-js` is available)

  - Target **engine binaries** for `prisma-client-js` (for example, `debian-openssl-1.0.x` if you are deploying to Ubuntu 14.04, or `native` if you are working locally)

- Preview features to include
- A [custom output folder](../prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/generating-prisma-client#using-a-custom-output-path) for the generated assets

A Prisma schema can have one or more generators, represented by the [`generator`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#generator) <span class="api"></span> block. The following example specifies a `provider` and a list of `previewFeatures`:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["sample-preview-feature"]
}
```

## Binary targets (`prisma-client-js`)

Prisma Client JS (prisma-client-js) uses several [engine binaries](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). For example:

- **Prisma Client** uses the [query engine binary file](../prisma-engines/query-engine) under the hood to communicate with a database.
- **Prisma Migrate** uses the migration engine binary file to run schema migrations against a database.

Engines are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma in the form of executable _binary files_.

The binary file is particularly important when [deploying](../../../guides/deployment/deployment) your application to production.

### The `native` binary target

The `native` binary target is special. It doesn't map to a concrete operating system. Instead, when `native` is specified in `binaryTargets`, Prisma detects the _current_ operating system and automatically specifies the correct binary target for it.

As an example, assume you're running **Mac OS** and you specify the following generator:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

In that case, Prisma detects your operating system and finds the right binary file for it based on the [list of supported operating systems](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) <span class="api"></span>. As you're running Mac OS, the binary file that was compiled for `darwin` will be selected.

> **Note**: The `native` binary target is the default. You can set it explicitly if you wish to [include additional binary targets for deployment to different environments](../../../guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-aws-lambda#binary-targets-in-schemaprisma).

### Custom binary targets

You can use environment variables to [specify a custom binary](../../components/prisma-engines#using-custom-engine-binaries) for one or more engines.

## Community generators

The following is a list of community created generators.
