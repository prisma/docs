<TopBlock>

A Prisma schema can have one or more generators, represented by the [`generator`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#generator) <span class="api"></span> block:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated/prisma-client-js"
}
```

A generator determines which assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command. The main property `provider` defines which **Prisma Client (language specific)** is created - currently, only `prisma-client-js` is available. Alternatively you can define any Npm package that follows our generator specification. Additionally and optionally you can define a custom output folder for the generated assets with `output`.

## Prisma Client: `prisma-client-js`

The generator for Prisma's Javascript Client accepts multiple additional properties:

- `previewFeatures`: [Preview features](/concepts/components/preview-features) to include
- `binaryTargets`: Engine binary targets for `prisma-client-js` (for example, `debian-openssl-1.1.x` if you are deploying to Ubuntu 18+, or `native` if you are working locally)

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["sample-preview-feature"]
  binaryTargets   = ["linux-msl"]
}
```

### Binary targets

Prisma Client JS (`prisma-client-js`) uses several [engines](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). Engines are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma in the form of executable, platform dependent engine files. Depending on which platform you are executing your code on, you need the correct file. "Binary targets" are used to define which files should be present for the target platform(s).

The correct file is particularly important when [deploying](/guides/deployment/deployment) your application to production, which often differs from your local development environment.

#### The `native` binary target

The `native` binary target is special. It doesn't map to a concrete operating system. Instead, when `native` is specified in `binaryTargets`, Prisma detects the _current_ operating system and automatically specifies the correct binary target for it.

As an example, assume you're running **Mac OS** and you specify the following generator:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

In that case, Prisma detects your operating system and finds the right binary file for it based on the [list of supported operating systems](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) <span class="api"></span>. As you're running Mac OS (`darwin`), the binary file that was compiled for `darwin` will be selected.

> **Note**: The `native` binary target is the default. You can set it explicitly if you wish to [include additional binary targets for deployment to different environments](/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-aws-lambda#binary-targets-in-schemaprisma).

## Community generators

The following is a list of community created generators.

> **Note**: Community projects are not maintained or officially supported by Prisma and some features may be out of sync. Use at your own discretion.

- [`prisma-dbml-generator`](https://notiz.dev/blog/prisma-dbml-generator): Transforms the Prisma schema into [Database Markup Language](https://www.dbml.org/home/) (DBML) which allows for an easy visual representation
- [`prisma-docs-generator`](https://github.com/pantharshit00/prisma-docs-generator): Generates an individual API reference for Prisma Client
- [`prisma-json-schema-generator`](https://github.com/valentinpalkovic/prisma-json-schema-generator): Transforms the Prisma schema in [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/)
- [`typegraphql-prisma`](https://github.com/MichalLytek/typegraphql-prisma#readme): Generates [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/) CRUD resolvers for Prisma models
- [`prisma-typegraphql-types-gen`](https://github.com/YassinEldeeb/prisma-tgql-types-gen): Generates [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/) class types and enums from your prisma type definitions, the generated output can be edited without being overwritten by the next gen and has the ability to correct you when you mess up the types with your edits.
- [`nexus-prisma`](https://github.com/prisma/nexus-prisma/): Allows to project Prisma models to GraphQL via [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/docs/)
- [`prisma-nestjs-graphql`](https://github.com/unlight/prisma-nestjs-graphql): Generates object types, inputs, args, etc. from the Prisma schema file for usage with `@nestjs/graphql` module
- [`prisma-appsync`](https://github.com/maoosi/prisma-appsync): Generates a full-blown GraphQL API for [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/)
- [`prisma-generator-nestjs-dto`](https://github.com/vegardit/prisma-generator-nestjs-dto): Generates DTO and Entity classes with relation `connect` and `create` options for use with [NestJS Resources](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/crud-generator) and [@nestjs/swagger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nestjs/swagger)
- [`prisma-erd-generator`](https://github.com/keonik/prisma-erd-generator): Generates an entity relationship diagram
- [`prismix`](https://github.com/jamiepine/prismix): Prisma requires your schema to be written in a single file, Prismix allows you to write as many schema files as you'd like, wherever you likeâ€”all while supporting cross-file model relations
- [`Prismaliser`](https://github.com/Ovyerus/prismaliser): Prismaliser is a visualisation webapp for Prisma schemas. It allows you to visually explore your schema and the relations between your models, by showing links between the different types of relations in the schema (many-to-many, one-to-many, one-to-one), similar to an Entity-relationship model.
- [`prisma-class-generator`](https://github.com/kimjbstar/prisma-class-generator): Generates classes from your Prisma Schema that can be used as DTO, Swagger Response, TypeGraphQL and so on.
