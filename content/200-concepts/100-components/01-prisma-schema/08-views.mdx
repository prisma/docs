<Admonition type="warning">

Support for views is currently a very early preview feature. You can add a view to your Prisma schema with the `view` keyword, but you cannot introspect your schema with `db pull` or apply your schema to your database with Prisma Migrate and `db push`.<br /><br />For updates on progress with this feature, follow [our GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17335).

</Admonition>

Database views allow you to name and store queries. In relational databases, views are [stored SQL queries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html) that might include columns in multiple tables, or calculated values such as aggregates. In MongoDB, views are queryable objects where the contents are defined by an [aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline) on other collections.

The `views` preview feature allows you to represent views in your Prisma schema with the `view` keyword. To use views in Prisma, follow these steps:

- [Enable the `views` preview feature](#enable-the-views-preview-feature)
- [Create a view in the underlying database](#create-a-view-in-the-underlying-database), either directly or as a [manual addition to a Prisma Migrate migration file](#use-views-with-prisma-migrate-and-db-push), or use an existing view
- [Represent the view in your Prisma schema](#add-views-to-your-prisma-schema)
- [Query the view in Prisma Client](#query-views-in-prisma-client)

</TopBlock>

## Enable the <inlineCode>views</inlineCode> preview feature

Support for views is currently in an early preview. To enable the `views` preview feature, add the `views` feature flag to the `previewFeatures` field of the `generator` block in your Prisma schema file:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3;add
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["views"]
}
```

## Create a view in the underlying database

Currently, you cannot apply views that you define in your Prisma schema to your database with Prisma Migrate and `db push`. Instead, you must first create the view in the underlying database, either manually or [as part of a migration](#use-views-with-prisma-migrate-and-db-push).

For example, take the following Prisma schema with a `User` model and a related `Profile` model:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Relational databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio    String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int    @unique
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id      String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  bio    String
  User   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId String @unique @db.ObjectId
}
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

Next, take a `UserInfo` view in the underlying database that combines the `email` and `name` fields from the `User` model and the `bio` field from the `Profile` model.

For a relational database, the SQL statement to create this view is:

```sql
CREATE VIEW "UserInfo" AS
    SELECT u.id, email, name, bio
    FROM "User" u
    LEFT JOIN "Profile" p ON u.id = p."userId"
```

For MongoDB, you can [create a view](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/views/join-collections-with-view/) with the following command:

```ts
db.createView('UserInfo', 'User', [
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: 'Profile',
      localField: '_id',
      foreignField: 'userId',
      as: 'ProfileData',
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      email: 1,
      name: 1,
      bio: '$ProfileData.bio',
    },
  },
  { $unwind: '$bio' },
])
```

## Use views with Prisma Migrate and <inlineCode>db push</inlineCode>

If you apply changes to your schema with Prisma Migrate or `db push`, Prisma does not create or run any SQL related to views.

To include views in a migration, run `migrate dev --create-only` and then manually add the SQL for views to your migration file. Alternatively, you can create views manually in the database.

## Add views to your Prisma schema

To add a view to your Prisma schema, use the `view` keyword.

You can represent the `UserInfo` view from the example above in your Prisma schema as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Relational databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma
view UserInfo {
  id    Int    @id
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```prisma
view UserInfo {
  id    String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Limitations

Currently, Prisma treats views in the same way as models. This means that a view needs to have a [unique identifier](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-an-id-field). In relational databases, this can be an `@id` or `@unique` attribute on one field, or an `@@id` or `@@unique` attribute on multiple fields. In MongoDB, this must be an `@id` attribute that maps to the `_id` field in the underlying database with `@map("_id")`.

In the example above, the `id` field has an `@id` attribute.

Prisma does not currently support introspection of views with `db pull`. Instead, you must manually add views to your Prisma schema.

<Admonition type="warning">

Currently, if you introspect your database, Prisma removes any existing `view` blocks in your schema file. To reinstate the views, you must revert this change.

</Admonition>

## Query views in Prisma Client

You can query views in Prisma Client in the same way that you query models. For example, the following query finds all users with a `name` of `'Alice'` in the `UserInfo` view defined above.

```ts
const userinfo = await prisma.userInfo.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Alice',
  },
})
```

Currently, Prisma Client allows you to update a view if the underlying database allows it, without any additional validation.

## Different types of views

### Updatable views

Some databases support updatable views (e.g. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html#SQL-CREATEVIEW-UPDATABLE-VIEWS), [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/view-updatability.html) and [SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-view-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16#updatable-views)). Updatable views allow you to create, update or delete entries. 

Currently Prisma treats all `view`s as updatable views. If the underlying database supports this functionality for the view, the operation should succeed. If the view is not marked as updatable, the database will return an error, and Prisma Client will then throw this error.

In the future, Prisma Client might support marking individual views as updatable or not updatable. Please [comment on our `views` feedback issue with your use case](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17335).

### Materialized views

Some databases support materialized views (e.g. [PostgreSQL]([https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html#SQL-CREATEVIEW-UPDATABLE-VIEWS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rules-materializedviews.html)), [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/views.html#materialized-views), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/materialized-views/), and [SQL Server, under the name "indexed views"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/views/create-indexed-views?view=sql-server-ver16)). Materialized views persist the result of the view query for faster access and only update it on demand. 

Currently Prisma has no understanding of materialized views, but when you [manually create a view](#create-a-view-in-the-underlying-database) you can also create a materialized view by using the corresponding command in the underlying database. You can then use Prisma's [raw query functionality](../prisma-client/raw-database-access) to execute the command to refresh the view manually.

In the future Prisma Client might support marking individual views as materializable and add a Prisma Client method to refresh the materialized view. Please [comment on our `views` feedback issue with your use case](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17335).
