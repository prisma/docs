Support for views is currently a very early, experimental preview feature. You can add a view to your Prisma schema with the `view` keyword, but you cannot introspect your schema with `db pull` or apply your schema to your database with Prisma Migrate and `db push`.<br /><br />For updates on progress with this feature, follow [our GitHub issue](TODO link).

</Admonition>

Database views allow you to name and store a query. In relational databases, views are stored SQL queries that might include columns in multiple tables, or calculated values such as aggregates. In MongoDB, views are queryable objects where the contents are defined by an [aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline) on other collections.

This guide explains how to enable the `views` preview feature and add views to your Prisma schema.

## How to enable the <inlineCode>views</inlineCode> preview feature

Support for views is currently in an early preview. To enable the `views` preview feature, add the `views` feature flag to the `previewFeatures` field of the `generator` block in your Prisma schema file:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3;add
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["views"]
}
```

## How to add views to your Prisma schema

To add a view to your Prisma schema, use the `view` keyword. For example, start with a `User` model with a linked `Profile`:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Relational databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio    String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int    @unique
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id      String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  bio    String
  userId String @unique @db.ObjectId
  User   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

Next, take a `UserInfo` view in the underlying database that combines the `email` and `name` fields from the `User` model and the `bio` field from the `Profile` model.

For a relational database, the SQL statement to create this view is:

```sql
CREATE VIEW "UserInfo" AS
    SELECT u.id, email, name, bio
    FROM "User" u
    LEFT JOIN "Profile" p ON u.id = p."userId"
```

For MongoDB, you can [create a view](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/views/join-collections-with-view/) with the following command:

```ts
db.createView( "UserInfo", "User", [
   {
      $lookup:
         {
            from: "Profile",
            localField: "_id",
            foreignField: "userId",
            as: "ProfileData"
         }
   },
   {
      $project:
         {
           _id: 1,
           email: 1,
           name: 1,
           bio: "$ProfileData.bio"
         }
   },
      { $unwind: "$bio" }
] )
```

You can represent the `UserInfo` view in your Prisma schema as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Relational databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma
view UserInfo {
  id    Int    @id
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```prisma
view UserInfo {
  id    String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

As with models, a view needs to have a [unique identifier](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-an-id-field). In relational databases, this can be an `@id` or `@unique` attribute on one field, or an `@@id` or `@@unique` attribute on multiple fields. In MongoDB, this must be an `@id` attribute that maps to the `_id` field in the underlying database with `map(_id)`.

In the example above, the `id` field has an `@id` attribute.

Introspection of views with `db pull` is currently not supported. Instead, you must manually add views to your Prisma schema.

<Admonition type="warning">

If you introspect an existing schema withÂ views, Prisma removes them. To reinstate the views, you must revert this change.

## How to use views with Prisma Migrate and <inlineCode>db push</inlineCode>

If you apply changes to your schema with Prisma Migrate or `db push`, Prisma does not create or run any SQL related to views.

To include views in a migration, run `migrate dev --create-only` and then manually add the SQL for views. Alternatively, you can create views manually in the database.

## How to query views in Prisma Client

You can query views in Prisma Client in the same way that you query models. For example, the following query finds all users with a `name` of `'Alice'` in the `UserInfo` view defined above.

```ts
const userinfo = await prisma.userInfo.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Alice',
  },
})
```

Currently, Prisma Client allows you to update a view if the underlying database allows it, without any additional validation.
