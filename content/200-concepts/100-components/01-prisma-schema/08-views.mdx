<Admonition type="warning">

Support for views is currently a very early preview feature. You can add a view to your Prisma schema with the `view` keyword, but you cannot introspect your schema with `db pull` or apply your schema to your database with Prisma Migrate and `db push`.<br /><br />For updates on progress with this feature, follow [our GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17335).

</Admonition>

Database views allow you to name and store queries. In relational databases, views are [stored SQL queries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html) that might include columns in multiple tables, or calculated values such as aggregates. In MongoDB, views are queryable objects where the contents are defined by an [aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline) on other collections.

The `views` preview feature allows you to represent views in your Prisma schema with the `view` keyword. To use views in Prisma, follow these steps:

- [Enable the `views` preview feature](#enable-the-views-preview-feature)
- [Create a view in the underlying database](#create-a-view-in-the-underlying-database), either directly or as a [manual addition to a Prisma Migrate migration file](#use-views-with-prisma-migrate-and-db-push), or use an existing view
- [Represent the view in your Prisma schema](#add-views-to-your-prisma-schema)
- [Query the view in Prisma Client](#query-views-in-prisma-client)

## Enable the <inlineCode>views</inlineCode> preview feature

Support for views is currently in an early preview. To enable the `views` preview feature, add the `views` feature flag to the `previewFeatures` field of the `generator` block in your Prisma schema file:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3;add
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["views"]
}
```

Please leave feedback about this preview feature in our dedicated [preview feature feedback issue for `views`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17335).

## Create a view in the underlying database

Currently, you cannot apply views that you define in your Prisma schema to your database with Prisma Migrate and `db push`. Instead, you must first create the view in the underlying database, either manually or [as part of a migration](#use-views-with-prisma-migrate-and-db-push).

For example, take the following Prisma schema with a `User` model and a related `Profile` model:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Relational databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio    String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int    @unique
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id      String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  bio    String
  User   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId String @unique @db.ObjectId
}
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

Next, take a `UserInfo` view in the underlying database that combines the `email` and `name` fields from the `User` model and the `bio` field from the `Profile` model.

For a relational database, the SQL statement to create this view is:

```sql
CREATE VIEW "UserInfo" AS
    SELECT u.id, email, name, bio
    FROM "User" u
    LEFT JOIN "Profile" p ON u.id = p."userId"
```

For MongoDB, you can [create a view](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/views/join-collections-with-view/) with the following command:

```ts
db.createView('UserInfo', 'User', [
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: 'Profile',
      localField: '_id',
      foreignField: 'userId',
      as: 'ProfileData',
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      email: 1,
      name: 1,
      bio: '$ProfileData.bio',
    },
  },
  { $unwind: '$bio' },
])
```

## Use views with Prisma Migrate and <inlineCode>db push</inlineCode>

If you apply changes to your schema with Prisma Migrate or `db push`, Prisma does not create or run any SQL related to views.

To include views in a migration, run `migrate dev --create-only` and then manually add the SQL for views to your migration file. Alternatively, you can create views manually in the database.

## Add views to your Prisma schema

To add a view to your Prisma schema, use the `view` keyword.

You can represent the `UserInfo` view from the example above in your Prisma schema as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Relational databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma
view UserInfo {
  id    Int    @id
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```prisma
view UserInfo {
  id    String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Limitations

Currently, Prisma treats views in the same way as models. This means that a view needs to have a [unique identifier](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-an-id-field). In relational databases, this can be an `@id` or `@unique` attribute on one field, or an `@@id` or `@@unique` attribute on multiple fields. In MongoDB, this must be an `@id` attribute that maps to the `_id` field in the underlying database with `@map("_id")`.

In the example above, the `id` field has an `@id` attribute.

Prisma does not currently support introspection of views with `db pull`. Instead, you must manually add views to your Prisma schema.

<Admonition type="warning">

Currently, if you introspect your database, Prisma removes any existing `view` blocks in your schema file. To reinstate the views, you must revert this change.

</Admonition>

## Query views in Prisma Client

You can query views in Prisma Client in the same way that you query models. For example, the following query finds all users with a `name` of `'Alice'` in the `UserInfo` view defined above.

```ts
const userinfo = await prisma.userInfo.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Alice',
  },
})
```

Currently, Prisma Client allows you to update a view if the underlying database allows it, without any additional validation.
