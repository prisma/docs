<Admonition type="warning">

Support for views is currently a very early [Preview](/about/prisma/releases#preview) feature. You can add a view to your Prisma schema with the `view` keyword or introspect the views in your database schema with `db pull`. You cannot yet apply views in your schema to your database with Prisma Migrate and `db push` unless the changes are added manually to your migration file using the `--create-only` flag. <br /><br />For updates on progress with this feature, follow [our GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17335).

</Admonition>

Database views allow you to name and store queries. In relational databases, views are [stored SQL queries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html) that might include columns in multiple tables, or calculated values such as aggregates. In MongoDB, views are queryable objects where the contents are defined by an [aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline) on other collections.

The `views` preview feature allows you to represent views in your Prisma schema with the `view` keyword. To use views in Prisma, follow these steps:

- [Enable the `views` preview feature](#enable-the-views-preview-feature)
- [Create a view in the underlying database](#create-a-view-in-the-underlying-database), either directly or as a [manual addition to a Prisma Migrate migration file](#use-views-with-prisma-migrate-and-db-push), or use an existing view
- [Represent the view in your Prisma schema](#add-views-to-your-prisma-schema)
- [Query the view in Prisma Client](#query-views-in-prisma-client)

</TopBlock>

## Enable the <inlineCode>views</inlineCode> preview feature

Support for views is currently in an early preview. To enable the `views` preview feature, add the `views` feature flag to the `previewFeatures` field of the `generator` block in your Prisma schema file:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3;add
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["views"]
}
```

Please leave feedback about this preview feature in our dedicated [preview feature feedback issue for `views`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17335).

## Create a view in the underlying database

Currently, you cannot apply views that you define in your Prisma schema to your database with Prisma Migrate and `db push`. Instead, you must first create the view in the underlying database, either manually or [as part of a migration](#use-views-with-prisma-migrate-and-db-push).

For example, take the following Prisma schema with a `User` model and a related `Profile` model:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Relational databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio    String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int    @unique
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id      String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  bio    String
  User   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId String @unique @db.ObjectId
}
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

Next, take a `UserInfo` view in the underlying database that combines the `email` and `name` fields from the `User` model and the `bio` field from the `Profile` model.

For a relational database, the SQL statement to create this view is:

```sql
CREATE VIEW "UserInfo" AS
    SELECT u.id, email, name, bio
    FROM "User" u
    LEFT JOIN "Profile" p ON u.id = p."userId";
```

For MongoDB, you can [create a view](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/views/join-collections-with-view/) with the following command:

```ts
db.createView('UserInfo', 'User', [
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: 'Profile',
      localField: '_id',
      foreignField: 'userId',
      as: 'ProfileData',
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      email: 1,
      name: 1,
      bio: '$ProfileData.bio',
    },
  },
  { $unwind: '$bio' },
])
```

## Use views with Prisma Migrate and <inlineCode>db push</inlineCode>

If you apply changes to your Prisma schema with Prisma Migrate or `db push`, Prisma does not create or run any SQL related to views.

To include views in a migration, run `migrate dev --create-only` and then manually add the SQL for views to your migration file. Alternatively, you can create views manually in the database.

## Add views to your Prisma schema

To add a view to your Prisma schema, use the `view` keyword.

You can represent the `UserInfo` view from the example above in your Prisma schema as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Relational databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma
view UserInfo {
  id    Int    @unique
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```prisma
view UserInfo {
  id    String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Write by hand

A `view` block is comprised of two main pieces:

- The `view` block definition
- The view's field definitions

These two pieces allow you to define the name of your view in the generated Prisma Client and the columns present in your view's query results.

#### Define a `view` block

To define the `UserInfo` view from the example above, begin by using the `view` keyword to define a `view` block in your schema named `UserInfo`:

```prisma
view UserInfo {
  // Fields
}
```

<!-- It would be good to reference some recommended naming conventions as we do for `model` blocks -->

#### Define fields

The properties of a view are called _fields_, which consist of:

- A field name
- A field type

The fields of the `UserInfo` example view can be defined as follows:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Relational databases" icon="database"/>, <FileWithIcon text="MongoDB" icon="database"/>]}>
<tab>

```prisma highlight=2-5;normal
view UserInfo {
  id    Int    @unique
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

</tab>
<tab>

```prisma highlight=2-5;normal
view UserInfo {
  id    String  @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

</tab>
</TabbedContent>

Each _field_ of a `view` block represents a column in the query results of the view in the underlying database.

### Use introspection

<Admonition type="warning">
Currently only available for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server and CockroachDB.
</Admonition>

If you have an existing view or views defined in your database, [introspection](/concepts/components/introspection) will automatically generate `view` blocks in your Prisma schema that represent those views.

Assuming the example `UserInfo` view exists in your underlying database, running the following command will generate a `view` block in your Prisma schema representing that view:

```sh copy
npx prisma db pull
```

The resulting `view` block will be defined as follows:

```prisma
/// The underlying view does not contain a valid unique identifier and can therefore currently not be handled by the Prisma Client.
view UserInfo {
  id    Int?
  email String?
  name  String?
  bio   String?

  @@ignore
}
```

The `view` block is generated initially with a `@@ignore` attribute because [there is no unique identifier defined](#unique-identifier) (which is currently a [limitation](#unique-identifier) of the views preview feature).

In this view's case, the `id` column refers to a uniquely identifiable field in the underlying `User` table so that field will also be used as the uniquely identifiable field in the `view` block.

In order to make this `view` block valid you will need to:

- Remove the _optional_ flag `?` from the `id` field
- Add the `@unique` attribute to the `id` field
- Remove the `@@ignore` attribute
- Remove the comment Prisma generated warning about an invalid view

```prisma highlight=4;add|1,3,8,9;delete
/// The underlying view does not contain a valid unique identifier and can therefore currently not be handled by the Prisma Client.
view UserInfo {
  id    Int?
  id    Int    @unique
  email String?
  name  String?
  bio   String?

  @@ignore
}
```

When re-introspecting your database, any custom changes to your view definitions will be preserved.

<Admonition type="warning">

Please note for now `db pull` will only introspect views in your schema when using PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server or CockroachDB. Support for this workflow will be extended to other database providers soon.

### Limitations

#### Unique Identifier

Currently, Prisma treats views in the same way as models. This means that a view needs to have at least one _unique identifier_, which can be represented by any of the following:

- A unique constraint denoted with [`@unique`](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-a-unique-field)
- A composite unique constraint denoted with [`@@unique`](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-a-unique-field)
- An [`@id`](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-an-id-field) field
- A composite identifier denoted with [`@@id`](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#composite-ids)

In relational databases, a view's unique identifier can be defined as a `@unique` attribute on one field, or a `@@unique` attribute on multiple fields. When possible, it is preferable to use a `@unique` or `@@unique` constraint over an `@id` or `@@id` field. 

In MongoDB, however, the unique identifier must be an `@id` attribute that maps to the `_id` field in the underlying database with `@map("_id")`.

In the example above, the `id` field has a `@unique` attribute. If another column in the underlying `User` table had been defined as uniquely identifiable and made available in the view's query results, that column could have been used as the unique identifier instead.

#### Introspection

Currently, introspection of views is only available for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server and CockroachDB. If you are using another database provider, your views must be added manually. 

This is a temporary limitation and support for introspection will be extended soon to the other supported datasource providers.

## Query views in Prisma Client

You can query views in Prisma Client in the same way that you query models. For example, the following query finds all users with a `name` of `'Alice'` in the `UserInfo` view defined above.

```ts
const userinfo = await prisma.userInfo.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Alice',
  },
})
```

Currently, Prisma Client allows you to update a view if the underlying database allows it, without any additional validation.
