Extended native database type support is a Preview feature in [2.11.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/2.11.0). This Preview includes the following features:

* Introspection adds **type attributes** to each field that **enrich your schema** with information about the underlying native database type
* New [Prisma types](#additional-prisma-types)

In the following example, the `String` fields map to a `varchar` with different character limits in the underlying database:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Post {
  authorId                   Int?     @db.Int
|  content                    String?  @db.VarChar(1000)
  id                         Int      @id @default(autoincrement()) @db.Int
  published                  Boolean  @default(false) @db.TinyInt
|  title                      String   @db.VarChar(191)
}
```

In a future release, [Prisma Migrate support for type attributes](#prisma-migrate-not-yet-supported) will give you greater control over exactly which types are created in the underlying database.

## Native database type attributes

When you enable the `nativeTypes` Preview feature, introspection adds a native database type attribute that describes the underlying database type:

  ```prisma file=schema.prisma
  model Post {
    id      Int    @id
    title   String @db.VarChar(200)
    tagline String @db.Char(50)
  }
  ```

> **Note**: `db push` and Prisma Migrate are not yet supported, which means that you cannot add the type attributes to the schema yourself.

Each Prisma type can map to multiple native database types. Native database type attributes are:

* Specific to the underlying provider - for example, PostgreSQL uses `@db.Boolean` for `Boolean` whereas MySQL uses `@db.TinyInt`
* Written in PascalCase (for example, `VarChar` or `Text`)
* Prefixed by `@db`, where `db` is the name of the `datasource` block in your schema

Currently, the main benefit of native database type attributes is an **enriched schema** when you introspect - you can see if  `String` is `varchar(200)` or just `text`.

In future, native database type attributes will allow you finer control over exactly what type is created in the database when you migrate.

## Enable native database type attributes

To enable native database type attributes:

1. Update the `generator` block in your schema as shown:

    ```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
    generator client {
        provider        = "prisma-client-js"
    |    previewFeatures = ["nativeTypes"]
    }
    ```

1. Introspect your database to populate the schema with type attributes:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma introspect
   ```

1. Generate Prisma Client:

    ```terminal
    npx prisma generate
    ```

## Additional Prisma types

The type attribute Preview feature includes the following new Prisma types:

* [`Decimal`](native-types-mappings#decimal)
* [`Bytes`](native-types-mappings#bytes) 
* [`BigInt`](native-types-mappings#bigint)

### Working with new types in Prisma Client

* `BigInt` uses [`BigInt` type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) (Node.js 10.4.0+ required)
* `Decimal` uses the [`Decimal.js` library](https://mikemcl.github.io/decimal.js/)
* `Bytes` uses [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html)

The following model uses the three new Primsa types:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model sample {
  bigInt  BigInt?  @db.BigInt
  byteA   Bytes?   @db.ByteA
  decimal Decimal? @db.Numeric
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement()) @db.Integer
}
```

The following example demonstrates how to create and filter on `sample` records with Prisma Client:

```ts file=script.ts
// Create record
const newTypes = await prisma.sample.create({
  data:{
    bigInt: BigInt(534543543534),
    decimal: new Decimal(24.454545),
    byteA: Buffer.from(["Hello", "this is a string", 1, 9, 4])
  }
});

// Filter records
const newTypesFilter = await prisma.dates.findMany({
  where: {
    bigInt: {
      gt: BigInt(4594375943753)
    },
    byteA: {
      not: Buffer.from(["Hey!"])
    }
  }
})
```

## Limitations

### Prisma Migrate not yet supported

Prisma Migrate does not yet support native database type attributes. If you try to `prisma migrate` or `prisma db push`, you will see the following error:

```terminal
Response "Some of the requested Preview features are not yet allowed in migration engine. Please remove them from your data model before using migrations. (blocked: `nativeTypes`)"
```

### <inlinecode>db push</inlinecode> not yet supported

`db push` uses the Migration Engine, which does not support native database type attributes yet.
