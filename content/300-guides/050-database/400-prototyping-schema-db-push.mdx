**MongoDB not supported** <br />
`db push` uses the Migration Engine and does not currently support the [MongoDB connector](../../concepts/database-connectors/mongodb).

</Admonition>

This guide demonstrates how to use [`db push`](../../../reference/api-reference/command-reference#db-push) to prototype a new schema or a new feature for an existing schema.

Although `db push` and Prisma Migrate both synchronize your Prisma schema and database schema, they play [different roles in the development workflow](../../../concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push#choosing-db-push-or-prisma-migrate) and should not be used interchangeably.

## Prototyping a new schema

The following scenario demonstrates how to use `db push` to synchronize a new schema with an empty database, and evolve that schema - including what happens when `db push` detects that a change will result in data loss.

1.  Create a first draft of your schema:

    ```prisma
    generator client {
        provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    datasource db {
        provider = "postgresql"
        url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    model User {
        id       Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
        name     String
        jobTitle String
        posts    Post[]
        profile  Profile?
    }

    model Profile {
        id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
        biograpy String // Intentional typo!
        userId   Int
        user     User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
    }

    model Post {
        id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
        title      String
        published  Boolean    @default(true)
        content    String     @db.VarChar(500)
        authorId   Int
        author     User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
        categories Category[]
    }

    model Category {
        id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
        name  String @db.VarChar(50)
        posts Post[]
        @@unique([name])
    }
    ```

2.  Use `db push` to push the initial schema to the database:

    ```terminal
    npx prisma db push
    ```

3.  Create some example content:

    ```ts
    const add = await prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        name: 'Eloise',
        jobTitle: 'Programmer',
        posts: {
          create: {
            title: 'How to create a MySQL database',
            content: 'Some content',
          },
        },
      },
    })
    ```

4.  Make an additive change - for example, create a new required field:

    ```prisma highlight=6;add
    /* ... */

    model Post {
        id          Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
        title       String
        description String
        published   Boolean    @default(true)
        content     String     @db.VarChar(500)
        authorId    Int
        author      User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
        categories  Category[]
    }

    /* ... */
    ```

5.  Push the changes:

    ```terminal
    npx prisma db push
    ```

    `db push` will prompt you to reset because you cannot add a required field to a table with existing content unless you provide a default value:

    ```bash
    ⚠️ We found changes that cannot be executed:

    • Added the required column `description` to the `Post` table without a default value. There are 2 rows in this table, it is not possible to execute this.

    ? To apply this step we need to reset the database, do you want to continue? All data will be lost. » (y/N)
    ```

<Tip>

Use the `--accept-data-loss` flag to skip this warning, or `--force-reset` to ignore all warnings. Furthermore, if your schema changes mean that seed scripts will no longer work, you can use the `--skip-seed` flag to ignore seed scripts.

</Tip>

6.  Confirm data loss and apply changes to your database (or revisit your schema):

    ```bash
     There might be data loss when applying the changes:

     • Added the required column `description` to the `Post` table without a default value.

     ? Do you want to ignore the warning(s)? Some data will be lost. » (y/N)
    ```

    > **Note**: Unlike Prisma Migrate, `db push` does not generate migrations that you can modify to preserve data, and is therefore best suited for prototyping in a development environment.

7.  Continue to evolve your schema until it reaches a relatively stable state.

8.  Initialize a migration history:

    ```terminal
    npx prisma migrate dev --name initial-state
    ```

    The steps taken to reach the initial prototype are not preserved - `db push` does not generate a history.

9.  Push your migration history and Prisma schema to source control.

At this point, the final draft of your prototyping is preserved in a migration and can be pushed to other environments (testing, production, or other members of your team).

## Prototyping with an existing migration history

The following scenario demonstrates how to use `db push` to prototype a change to a Prisma schema where a migration history already exists.

1. Check out the latest Prisma schema and migration history:

   ```prisma
   generator client {
       provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }

   datasource db {
       provider = "postgresql"
       url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }

   model User {
       id       Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
       name     String
       jobTitle String
       posts    Post[]
       profile  Profile?
   }

   model Profile {
       id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
       biograpy String // Intentional typo!
       userId   Int
       user     User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
   }

   model Post {
       id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
       title      String
       published  Boolean    @default(true)
       content    String     @db.VarChar(500)
       authorId   Int
       author     User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
       categories Category[]
   }

   model Category {
       id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
       name  String @db.VarChar(50)
       posts Post[]
       @@unique([name])
   }
   ```

2. Prototype your new feature, which can involve any number of steps. For example, you might:

   - Create a `tags String[]` field, then run `db push`
   - Change the field type to `tags Tag[]` and add a new model named `Tag`, then run `db push`
   - Change your mind and restore the original `tags String[]` field, then call `db push`
   - Make a manual change to the `tags` field in the database - for example, adding a constraint

   After experimenting with several solutions, the final schema change looks like this:

   ```prisma
   model Post {
       id          Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
       title       String
       description String
       published   Boolean    @default(true)
       content     String     @db.VarChar(500)
       authorId    Int
       author      User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
       categories  Category[]
       tags        String[]
   }
   ```

3. To create a migration that adds the new `tags` field, run the `migrate dev` command:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev --name added-tags
   ```

   Prisma Migrate will prompt you to reset because the changes you made manually and with `db push` while prototyping are not part of the migration history:

   ```bash
   √ Drift detected: Your database schema is not in sync with your migration history.

   We need to reset the PostgreSQL database "prototyping" at "localhost:5432".
   Do you want to continue? All data will be lost. ... yes
   ```

4. Prisma Migrate replays the existing migration history, generates a new migration based on your schema changes, and applies those changes to the database.

At this point, the final result of your prototyping is preserved in a migration, and can be pushed to other environments (testing, production, or other members of your team).
