Cascading deletes allow you to define how foreign key relationships should be handled when you delete a record. For example, when you delete a user, you might use a cascading delete to remove that user's extended profile from a related table. By contrast, you might _not_ want to delete that user's blog posts.

‚ùó If using version [3.0.1](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/3.0.1) or later, it is possible to do cascading deletes using [Referential actions](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/referential-actions). Follow that link for more information.
  Be sure to follow the [upgrade guide](/guides/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-3/referential-actions) before using this feature.
  
```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;normal
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```
  
The guides in this section describe how to implement cascading deletes manually in the database and verify the results in Prisma Client.
