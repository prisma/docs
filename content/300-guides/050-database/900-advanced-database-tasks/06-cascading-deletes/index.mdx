Cascading deletes allow you to define how foreign key relationships should be handled when you delete a record. For example, when you delete a user, you might use a cascading delete to remove that user's extended profile from a related table. By contrast, you might _not_ want to delete that user's blog posts.

The guides in this section describe how to implement cascading deletes manually in the database and verify the results in Prisma Client.

<Admonition type="warning">

In [2.26.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.26.0) and later it is possible to do cascading deletes using the **preview feature** [referential actions](../../../../concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/referential-actions).
