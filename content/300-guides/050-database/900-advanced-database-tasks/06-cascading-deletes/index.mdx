<Admonition type="warning">

This section describes how to do cascading deletes before Prisma version 2.26.0. If you use version 2.26.0 or later, we recommend that you do cascading deletes with [Referential actions](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/referential-actions).

</Admonition>

Cascading deletes allow you to define how foreign key relationships should be handled when you delete a record. For example, when you delete a user, you might use a cascading delete to remove that user's extended profile from a related table. By contrast, you might _not_ want to delete that user's blog posts.

The guides in this section describe how to implement cascading deletes manually in the database and verify the results in Prisma Client.
