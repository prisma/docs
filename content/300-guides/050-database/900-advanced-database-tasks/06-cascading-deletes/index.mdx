Cascading deletes allow you to define how foreign key relationships should be handled when you delete a record. For example, when you delete a user, you might use a cascading delete to remove that user's extended profile from a related table. By contrast, you might _not_ want to delete that user's blog posts.

It is not yet possible to define cascading deletes in Prisma Schema Language - [follow GitHub issue #2810](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2810) for updates and discussions. The guides in this section describe how to implement cascading deletes manually in the database and verify the results in Prisma Client.
