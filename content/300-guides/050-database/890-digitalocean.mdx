## What is Digital Ocean?

[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is a cloud infrastructure provider that offers cloud services to help businesses scale and grow. They are known for their developer-friendly approach and affordable pricing. One of the services it provides is database hosting with fully managed instances of the developer's choice between PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

To learn more about Digital Ocean Managed Databases, you can check out their documentation [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases).

## Commonalities with other database providers

Many aspects of using Prisma with a managed database on Digital Ocean are just like using Prisma with any other relational database. You can still:

- model your database with the [Prisma Schema Language](/concepts/components/prisma-schema)
- use any of Prisma's existing [database connectors](/concepts/database-connectors) in your schema depending on the database of choice, along with the connection string provided to you by Digital Ocean
- use [Introspection](/concepts/components/introspection) for existing projects if you already have a database schema in your Digital Ocean Managed Database
- use [`db push`](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push) to push changes in your schema to your Digital Ocean Managed Database
- use [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client) in your application to talk to the database server at Digital Ocean Managed Database

## Specific considerations

Depending on the database you choose to host on Digital Ocean, there will be slight differences in  the Prisma database connector you use and the connection string provided. At the time writing this article, Digital Ocean supports the hosting of the following databases:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB

To ensure you are using best practices for each type of database, you can reference the database connectors documentation [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors).
