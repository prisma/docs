title: Enable extensions for native database functions
metaDecription: How to enable native database functions for projects that use Prisma Migrate.

<TopBlock>

Some [native database functions](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/features-without-psl-equivalent#native-database-functions) <span class="concept"></span> are part of optional extensions. You cannot use the function if the extension is not installed. If your project uses [Prisma Migrate](../../../concepts/components/prisma-migrate), you must install the extension as part of a migration.

<Admonition type="warning">

**Do not** manually install extensions - the [shadow database](../../../concepts/components/prisma-migrate/shadow-database) requires the same extensions, and since this database is created and deleted automatically, the only way to install extensions is to use migrations.

</Admonition>

The following example demonstrates how to install the `pgcrypto` extension as part of a migration:

1. Add the field with the native database function to your schema:

   ```prisma
   model User {
     id String @id @default(dbgenerated("gen_random_uuid()")) @db.Uuid
   }
   ```

   If you include a cast operator (such as `::TEXT`), you must surround the entire function with parentheses:

   ```prisma
   @default(dbgenerated("(gen_random_uuid()::TEXT)")
   ```

1. Use the `--create-only` flag to generate a new migration without applying it:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
   ```

1. Open the generated `migration.sql` file and enable the `pgcrypto` module:

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;

   ADD COLUMN     "id" UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
   ADD PRIMARY KEY ("id");
   ```

1. Apply the migration:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

Each time you reset the database or add a new member to your team, all required functions are part of the migration history.
