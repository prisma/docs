title: Include unsupported database features
metaDescription: How to include unsupported database features for projects that use Prisma Migrate.
---

<TopBlock>

Prisma Migrate uses the Prisma schema to determine what features to create in the database. However, some database features [cannot be represented in the Prisma schema](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/features-without-psl-equivalent) <span class="concept"></span>, including but not limited to:

- Stored procedures
- Triggers
- Views
- Partial indexes

To add an unsupported feature to your database, you must [customize a migration](customizing-migrations) to include that feature before you apply it.

<Tip>

The Prisma schema is able to represent [unsupported field types](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/features-without-psl-equivalent#unsupported-field-types) <span class="concept"></span> and [native database functions](enable-native-database-functions).

This guide **does not apply for MongoDB**.<br />
Instead of `migrate dev`, [`db push`](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push) is used for [MongoDB](/concepts/database-connectors/mongodb).

## Customize a migration to include an unsupported feature

To customize a migration to include an unsupported feature:

1. Use the `--create-only` flag to generate a new migration without applying it:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
   ```

1. Open the generated `migration.sql` file and add the unsupported feature - for example, a partial index:

   ```sql
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tests_success_constraint ON posts (subject, target)
   WHERE success;
   ```

1. Apply the migration:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

1. Commit the modified migration to source control.
