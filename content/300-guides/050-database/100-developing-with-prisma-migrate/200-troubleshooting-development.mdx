This guide describes how to resolve issues with Prisma Migrate in a development environment, which often involves resetting your database. For production-focused troubleshooting, see:

## Handling migration history conflicts

A migration history conflict occurs when there are discrepancies between the **migrations folder in the file system** and the **`_prisma_migrations` table in the database**.

#### Causes of migration history conflict in a development environment

- A migration that has already been applied is later modified
- A migration that has already been applied is missing from the file system

In a development environment, switching between feature branches can result in a history conflict because the `_prisma_migrations` table contains migrations from `branch-1`, and switching to `branch-2` might cause some of those migrations to disappear.

> **Note**: You should [never purposefully delete or edit a migration](../../../concepts/components/prisma-migrate#do-not-edit-or-delete-migrations-that-have-been-applied), as this might result in discrepancies between development and production.

#### Fixing a migration history conflict in a development environment

If Prisma Migrate detects a migration history conflict when you run `prisma migrate dev`, the CLI will ask to reset the database and reapply the migration history.

## Schema drift

Database schema drift occurs when your database schema is out of sync with your migration history - the database schema has 'drifted away' from the source of truth.

#### Causes of schema drift in a development environment

Schema drift can occur if:

- The database schema was changed _without_ using migrations - for example, by using [`prisma db push`](../../../reference/api-reference/command-reference#db-push) or manually changing the database schema.

> **Note**: The [shadow database](../../../concepts/components/prisma-migrate/shadow-database) is required to detect schema drift, and can therefore only be done in a development environment.

#### Fixing schema drift in a development environment

If you made manual changes to the database that you do not want to keep, or can easily replicate in the Prisma schema:

1. Reset your database:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate reset
   ```

1. Replicate the changes in the Prisma schema and generate a new migration:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

If you made manual changes to the database that you want to keep, you can:

1. Introspect the database:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma introspect
   ```

   Prisma will update your schema with the changes made directly in the database.

1. Generate a new migration to include the introspected changes in your migration history:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev --name introspected_change
   ```

   Prisma Migrate will prompt you to reset, then applies all existing migrations and a new migration based on the introspected changes. Your database and migration history are now in sync, including your manual changes.

## Failed migrations

#### Causes of failed migrations in a development environment

A migration might fail if:

- You [modify a migration before running it](customizing-migrations) and introduce a syntax error
- You add a mandatory (`NOT NULL`) column to a table that already has data
- The migration process stopped unexpectedly
- The database shut down in the middle of the migration process

Each migration in the `_prisma_migrations` table has a `logs` column that stores the error.

#### Fixing failed migrations in a development environment

The easiest way to handle a failed migration in a developer environment is to address the root cause and reset the database. For example:

- If you introduced a SQL syntax error by manually editing the database, update the `migration.sql` file that failed and reset the database:

  ```terminal
  prisma migrate reset
  ```

- If you introduced a change in the Prisma schema that cannot be applied to a database with data (for example, a mandatory column in a table with data):

  1. Delete the `migration.sql` file.

  2. Modify the schema - for example, add a default value to the mandatory field.

  3. Migrate:

     ```terminal
     prisma migrate dev
     ```

     Prisma Migrate will prompt you to reset the database and re-apply all migrations.

- If something interrupted the migration process, reset the database:

  ```terminal
  prisma migrate reset
  ```

## Prisma Migrate and PgBouncer

You might see the following error if you attempt to run Prisma Migrate commands in an environment that uses PgBouncer for connection pooling:

```bash
Error: undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement "s0" already exists
```

See [Prisma Migrate and PgBouncer workaround](../../performance-and-optimization/connection-management/configure-pg-bouncer) for further information and a workaround. Follow [GitHub issue #6485](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6485) for updates.
