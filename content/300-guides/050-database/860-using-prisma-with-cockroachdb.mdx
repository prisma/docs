This guide discusses the concepts behind using Prisma and CockroachDB, explains the commonalities and differences between CockroachDB and other database providers, and leads you through the process for configuring your application to integrate with CockroachDB.

## What is CockroachDB?

CockroachDB is a distributed database that is designed for scalability and high availability. Features include:

- **Built-in scaling:** CockroachDB comes with automated replication, failover and repair capabilities to allow easy horizontal scaling of your application
- **Consistent transactions:** CockroachDB is a relational database that supports consistent transactions that maintain data integrity
- **Compatibility with PostgreSQL:** CockroachDB is compatible with PostgreSQL, allowing interoperability with a large ecosystem of existing products

## Commonalities with other database providers

CockroachDB is largely compatible with PostgreSQL, and can mostly be used with Prisma in the same way. You can still:

- model your database with the [Prisma Schema Language](/concepts/components/prisma-schema)
- connect to your database, using Prisma's [`cockroachdb` database connector](/concepts/database-connectors/cockroachdb)
- use [Introspection](/concepts/components/introspection) for existing projects if you already have a CockroachDB database
- use [Prisma Migrate](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate) to migrate your database schema to a new version
- use [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client) in your application to query your database in a type safe way based on your Prisma Schema

## Differences to consider

There are some CockroachDB-specific differences to be aware of when working with Prisma's `cockroachdb` connector:

- **Cockroach-specific native types:** CockroachDB has its own set of native [data types](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/data-types.html) which are supported in Prisma. To learn more, see [How to use CockroachDB's native types](#how-to-use-cockroachdbs-native-types).

- **Creating integer sequences:** CockroachDB provides many options for creating integer sequences in the underlying database. To support this, Prisma has introduced a [`sequence()`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#sequence) function for CockroachDB. For more information, see [How to use CockroachDB's `sequence()` function](#how-to-use-cockroachdbs-sequence-function).

## How to use Prisma with CockroachDB

This section provides more details on how to use CockroachDB-specific features.

### How to use CockroachDB's native types

For a full list of type mappings, see our [connector documentation](/concepts/database-connectors/cockroachdb#type-mapping-between-cockroachdb-and-the-prisma-schema).

### How to use CockroachDB's `sequence()` function

Sequences are a database feature that provide a way to create a set of unique values for a data column. CockroachDB provides [many sequence parameters](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/create-sequence#parameters) to allow control over the sequence â€“ for example, you can specify the minimum and maximum value.

Prisma now has a [`sequence()`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#sequence) function for CockroachDB that can take these sequence parameters as arguments. As an example, in the following `User` model the sequence for the `id` field has a `start` value of `2` and is incremented by `4` every time:

```file=schema.prisma
model User {
 id   Int    @id @default(sequence(start: 10, increment: 2))
 name String
}
```

The `sequence()` function should be used on CockroachDB in preference to [`autoincrement()`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#autoincrement). For a full list of available options, see our [reference documentation](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#sequence).

## More on using CockroachDB with Prisma

The fastest way to start using CockroachDB with Prisma is to refer to our Getting Started documentation:

- [Start from scratch](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-cockroachdb)
- [Add to existing project](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-cockroachdb)

These tutorials will take you through the process of connecting to CockroachDB, migrating your schema, and using the Prisma Client.

Further reference information is available in the [CockroachDB connector documentation](/concepts/database-connectors/cockroachdb).
