## What is Supabase?

Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative providing all the backend features you need to build a product. Unlike Firebase, Supabase is backed by PostgreSQL which can be accessed directly.

To learn more about Supabase, you can check out their Architecture [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture) and features [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/features)

## Commonalities with other database providers

Many aspects of using Prisma with Supabase are just like using Prisma with any other relational database. You can still:

- model your database with the [Prisma Schema Language](/concepts/components/prisma-schema)
- use Prisma's existing [`postgresql` database connector](/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql) in your schema, along with the [connection string Supabase provides you](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#finding-your-connection-string)
- use [Introspection](/concepts/components/introspection) for existing projects if you already have a database schema in Supabase
- use [`db push`](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push) to push changes in your schema to Supabase
- use [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client) in your application to talk to the database server at Supabase

## Getting Started with Supabase

Supabase has a great guide for connecting a database provided by Supabase to your Prisma project available [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/prisma).
