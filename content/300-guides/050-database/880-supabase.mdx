This guide discusses the concepts behind using Prisma and Supabase, explains the commonalities and differences between Supabase and other database providers, and leads you through the process for configuring your application to integrate with Supabase.

## What is Supabase?

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is a PostgreSQL hosting service and open source Firebase alternative providing all the backend features you need to build a product. Unlike Firebase, Supabase is backed by PostgreSQL which can be accessed directly using Prisma.

To learn more about Supabase, you can check out their architecture [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture) and features [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/features)

## Commonalities with other database providers

Many aspects of using Prisma with Supabase are just like using Prisma with any other relational database. You can still:

- model your database with the [Prisma Schema Language](/concepts/components/prisma-schema)
- use Prisma's existing [`postgresql` database connector](/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql) in your schema, along with the [connection string Supabase provides you](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#finding-your-connection-string)
- use [Introspection](/concepts/components/introspection) for existing projects if you already have a database schema in Supabase
- use [`db push`](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push) to push changes in your schema to Supabase
- use [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client) in your application to talk to the database server at Supabase

## Specific considerations

If your application is being deployed to a serverless environment, make sure that you follow our general guidance on [connection pooling](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#recommended-connection-pool-size-1). Supabase makes this easy by [providing connection pooling](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/prisma#connection-pooling-with-supabase) compatible with PgBouncer.

In short, you will need to update your Prisma schema to include `url` as well as `direct_url` as discussed [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/data-platform/data-proxy/prisma-cli-with-data-proxy#set-a-direct-database-connection-url-in-your-prisma-schema). In addition, you will need to add `pgbouncer=true` to the end of your `DATABASE_URL` string.

```env file=.env
# Connection to Supabase with PgBouncer. Used by Prisma Client.
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:__PASSWORD__@db.__YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT__.supabase.co:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"

# Direct connection to the database. Used for migrations.
DIRECT_URL="postgres://postgres:__PASSWORD__@db.__YOUR SUPABASE_PROJECT__.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

## Getting started with Supabase

Supabase has a great guide for connecting a database provided by Supabase to your Prisma project available [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/prisma).
