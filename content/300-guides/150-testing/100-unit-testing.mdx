Unit testing aims to isolate a small portion of code and test it for logically predictable behaviors. In the context of Prisma, this generally means testing a function which makes database calls using the Prisma client. A single test should focus on the data returned by the Prisma client and how the function handles that data, ensuring that it behaves as expected.

This means that you should aim to remove as many dependencies as possible, such as external services and databases, to keep the tests and their environments as lightweight as possible.

The following discussion on GitHub covers mocking the Prisma client using a dependency injection pattern: [Testing with Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/2083)
