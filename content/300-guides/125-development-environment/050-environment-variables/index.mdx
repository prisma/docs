An environment variable is a key value pair of string data stored on your machine's local environment.

Traditionally the name of the variable is uppercase, then followed by an equals sign, then the value of the variable:

```env
MY_VALUE=prisma
```

The environment variable belongs to the environment where a process is running.

Taking the `TEMP` environment variable as an example, one can query its value to find where to store temporary files. This is a system environment variable and can be queried by any process or application running on the machine.

Any program can read and create these environment variables. They are a cheap and effective way to store simple information.

## How does Prisma use environment variables?

Prisma always reads environment variables from the system's environment.

When you install Prisma for the first time it creates a convenience `.env` file for you to set your [`connection url`](../../../reference/database-reference/connection-urls) as an environment variable. When you use Prisma CLI or Prisma Client, the `.env` file content and the variables defined in there are put into the system's environment, where Prisma can read it and use it.

Looking to use more than one `.env` file? See [Using multiple `.env` files](./using-multiple-env-files) for information on how to setup and use multiple `.env` files in your application.

### Using environment variables in your code

If you want environment variables to be evaluated at runtime, you need to load them manually in your application code (for example, by using [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)):

```ts
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config() // Load the environment variables
console.log(`The connection URL is ${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`)
```
