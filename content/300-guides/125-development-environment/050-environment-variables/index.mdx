An environment variable is a key value pair of string data that is stored on your machine's local environment. Refer to our [Environment variables reference documentation](/reference/api-reference/environment-variables-reference) for specific details.

Typically the name of the variable is uppercase, this is then followed by an equals sign then the value of the variable:

```env
MY_VALUE=prisma
```

The environment variable belongs to the environment where a process is running.

Taking the `TEMP` environment variable as an example, one can query its value to find where to store temporary files. This is a system environment variable and can be queried by any process or application running on the machine.

## How does Prisma use environment variables?

Prisma always reads environment variables from the system's environment.

When you install Prisma for the first time it creates a convenience `.env` file for you to set your [`connection url`](/reference/database-reference/connection-urls) as an environment variable. When you use Prisma CLI or Prisma Client, the `.env` file content and the variables defined in there are put into the system's environment, where Prisma can read it and use it.

Looking to use more than one `.env` file? See [Using multiple `.env` files](./using-multiple-env-files) for information on how to setup and use multiple `.env` files in your application.

## Using <inlinecode>.env</inlinecode> files

Prisma creates a default `.env` file at your projects root. You can choose to replace this file or create a new one in the `prisma` folder, or if you choose to relocate your `schema.prisma` file, alongside that.

### `.env` file locations

The Prisma CLI looks for `.env` files, in order, in the following locations:

1. In the root folder of your project (`./.env`)
1. From the same folder as the schema specified by the `--schema` argument
1. From the same folder as the schema taken from `"prisma": {"schema": "/path/to/schema.prisma"}` in `package.json`
1. From the `./prisma` folder

If a `.env` file is located in step #1, but additional, clashing `.env` variables are located in steps #2 - 4, the CLI will throw an error. For example, if you specify a `DATABASE_URL` variable in two different `.env` files, you will get the following error:

```
Error: There is a conflict between env vars in .env and prisma/.env
Conflicting env vars:
  DATABASE_URL

We suggest to move the contents of prisma/.env to .env to consolidate your env vars.
```

The following table describes where the Prisma CLI looks for the `.env` file:

| **Command**                                     | **Schema file location**                                                     | **`.env` file locations checked, in order**               |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prisma [command]`                              | `./prisma/schema.prisma`                                                     | `./.env`<br />`./prisma/.env`                             |
| `prisma [command] --schema=./a/b/schema.prisma` | `./a/b/schema.prisma`                                                        | `./.env`<br />`./a/b/.env`<br />`./prisma/.env`           |
| `prisma [command]`                              | `"prisma": {"schema": "/path/to/schema.prisma"}`                             | `.env`<br /> `./path/to/schema/.env`<br />`./prisma/.env` |
| `prisma [command]`                              | No schema (for example, when running `prisma db pull` in an empty directory) | `./.env`<br />`./prisma/.env`                             |

Any environment variables defined in that `.env` file will automatically be loaded when running a Prisma CLI command.

<Admonition type="warning">

**Do not commit your `.env` files into version control**!

Refer to the `dotenv` documentation for information about [what happens if an environment variable is defined in two places](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#what-happens-to-environment-variables-that-were-already-set).

### Expanding variables

Variables stored in `.env` files can be expanded using the format specified by [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand).

```env file=.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test
DATABASE_URL_WITH_SCHEMA=${DATABASE_URL}?schema=public
```

This will make the environment variable `DATABASE_URL_WITH_SCHEMA` with value `postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test?schema=public` available for Prisma.

You can also use environment variables in the expansion that are set _outside_ of the `.env` file, for example a database URL that is set on a PaaS like Heroku or similar:

```terminal
# environment variable already set in the environment of the system
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test
```

```env file=.env
DATABASE_URL_WITH_SCHEMA=${DATABASE_URL}?schema=foo
```

This will make the environment variable `DATABASE_URL_WITH_SCHEMA` with value `postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test?schema=foo` available for Prisma.

### Example: Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in an `.env` file

It is common to load your database connection URL from an environment variable:

```prisma
// schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

You can set the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file:

```
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test?schema=public
```

When you run a command that needs access to the database defined via the `datasource` block (for example, `prisma db pull`), the Prisma CLI automatically loads the `DATABASE_URL` environment variables from the `.env` file and makes it available to the CLI.

### Using environment variables in your code

If you want environment variables to be evaluated at runtime, you need to load them manually in your application code (for example, by using [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)):

```ts
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config() // Load the environment variables
console.log(`The connection URL is ${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`)
```
