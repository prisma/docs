This guide describes how to add [Prisma Migrate](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate) to an existing project.

This guide **does not apply for MongoDB**.<br />
Instead of `migrate dev`, [`db push`](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push) is used for [MongoDB](/concepts/database-connectors/mongodb).

## Overview of the steps

The steps involved in adding Prisma Migrate to your project are:

1. Introspect your database to update your Prisma schema
1. Create a baseline migration
1. Update your schema or migration to workaround features not supported by Prisma Schema Language
1. Apply the baseline migration
1. Commit the migration history and Prisma schema

### Introspect to create or update your Prisma schema

Make sure your Prisma schema is in sync with your database schema. This should already be true if you are using a previous version of Prisma Migrate.

1. Introspect the database to make sure that your Prisma schema is up-to-date:

   ```terminal
   prisma db pull
   ```

### Create a baseline migration

Baselining is the process of initializing a migration history for a database that:

- ✔ Existed before you started using Prisma Migrate
- ✔ Contains data that must be maintained (like production), which means that the database cannot be reset

Baselining tells Prisma Migrate to assume that one or more migrations have **already been applied**. This prevents generated migrations from failing when they try to create tables and fields that already exist.

To create a baseline migration:

1. If you have a `prisma/migrations` folder, delete, move, rename, or archive this folder.

1. Run the following command to create a `migrations` directory inside with your preferred name. This example will use `0_init` for the migration name:

   ```terminal
   mkdir -p prisma/migrations/0_init
   ```

   <Admonition>

   Then `0_` is important because Prisma Migrate applies migrations in a [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order). You can use a different value such as the current timestamp.

1. Generate a migration and save it to a file using `prisma migrate diff`

   ```terminal no-lines
   npx prisma migrate diff \
   --from-empty \
   --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma \
   --script > prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql
   ```

1. Review the generated migration

### Work around features not supported by Prisma Schema Language

To include [unsupported database features](include-unsupported-database-features) that already exist in the database, you must replace or modify the initial migration SQL:

1. Open the `migration.sql` file generated in the [Create a baseline migration](#create-a-baseline-migration) section.

1. Modify the generated SQL. For example:

   - If the changes are minor, you can append additional custom SQL to the generated migration - the following example creates a partial index:

   ```sql highlight=3,4;add
   /* Generated migration SQL */

   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tests_success_constraint ON posts (subject, target)
    WHERE success;
   ```

   - If the changes are significant, it can be easier to replace the entire migration file with the result of a database dump ([`mysqldump`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html), [`pg_dump`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-pgdump.html))

<Admonition type="info">
  Note that the order of the tables matters when creating all of them at once,
  since foreign keys are created at the same step. Therefore, either re-order
  them or move constraint creation to the last step after all tables are
  created, so you won't face `can't create constraint` errors
</Admonition>

### Apply the initial migrations

To apply your initial migration(s):

1. Run the following command against your database:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 0_init
   ```

1. Review the database schema to ensure the migration leads to the desired end-state (for example, by comparing the schema to the production database).

The new migration history and the database schema should now be in sync with your Prisma schema.

### Commit the migration history and Prisma schema

Commit the following to source control:

- The entire migration history folder
- The `schema.prisma` file

## Resolve migration issues in production databases

In certain cases, you can run into issues with the migration history and that prevent you from applying further database migrations with `prisma migrate resolve`. This can happen if:

- A migration failed, either because of an error or because it was interrupted while running (for example, unexpected shutdown)
- The database needs to be baselined to skip certain migrations that are unnecessary on this database schema - this can be the case when a change to the database schema was done manually, such as a hotfix.

In order to fix these situations have a look at [Production Troubleshooting](/guides/migrate/production-troubleshooting#fixing-failed-migrations-with-migrate-diff-and-db-execute)
