<TopBlock>

Prisma does not yet natively support data migrations, but you can use the [expand and contract pattern](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/types/relational/expand-and-contract-pattern) to migrate your data. For example from one column into another.

This guide covers how you can use Prisma with the expand and contract pattern to:

- Expand your schema with a new column
- Create and run the data migration
- Contract your schema by dropping the old column

</TopBlock>

## Overview of the steps

This tutorial will walk you through the following steps:

1. Expand your schema with a new column
1. Create and run the data migration file
1. Contract your schema by dropping the old column

It also makes the following assumptions:

- The production database is accessible from the development machine
- `prisma migrate dev` is only run against development database 
- The expanding and contracting steps are handled in separate branches

For this guide, you will modify the following schema by replacing the `published` boolean field with a `status` enum:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  viewCount Int      @default(0)
}
```

## Expand your schema with a new column

Checkout to a new branch from your `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout -b create-status-field
```

Make the following updates to your Prisma schema:

- Create a `Status` enum with the following values: `Unknown`, `Draft`, `InReview`, and `Published`
- Add a `status` column to the `Post` model
- Mark the `published` field as optional

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma highlight=12,13,18-24;edit
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean? @default(false)
  status    Status
  author    User?    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

enum Status {
  Unknown
  Draft
  InProgress
  InReview
  Published
}
```

Create a new migration to sync the Prisma schema with the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-status-column
```

Prisma Migrate will give you the following warning because the field being added to the database is non-nullable, and the database contains existing data which require a default value.

<cmdResult>

<cmd>

```bash no-copy
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "data-migration", schema "public" at "localhost:5401"

Error:
⚠️ We found changes that cannot be executed:

  • Step 1 Added the required column `status` to the `Post` table without a default value. There are 4 rows in this table, it is not possible to execute this step.

You can use prisma migrate dev --create-only to create the migration file, and manually modify it to address the underlying issue(s).
Then run prisma migrate dev to apply it and verify it works.
```

</cmd>
</cmdResult>

Exit from the migration step and update the schema by adding a default value for the `status` field by adding the `@default()` attribute function.

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma highlight=13;edit
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean? @default(false)
  status    Status   @default(Unknown)
  author    User?    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

enum Status {
  Unknown
  Draft
  InProgress
  InReview
  Published
}
```

Re-run `prisma migrate dev` to generate and apply a migration to the database.

## Create and run the data migration file

### Create a data migration file

Inside the generated migration folder from the previous step, create a file called `data-migration.ts` file. This file will contain a data migration which will be implemented using Prisma Client.

Add the following code to migrate the data from the `published` field to the `status` field in the file you just created:

Update your `package.json` file to include the data migration file:

```ts file=prisma/migrations/20230417131956_add-status-column/data-migration.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany()

  await prisma.$transaction(
    posts.map((post) =>
      prisma.post.update({
        where: {
          id: post.id,
        },
        data: {
          status: post.published ? 'Published' : 'Unknown',
        },
      })
    )
  )
  console.log('Data migrated successfully')
}
```

The data migration is wrapped in a transaction to ensure that the query is rolled back, allowing you to iterate on your data migration file


Next steps:

1. Push your changes to a remote origin and create a new pull request.
1. Once you’re happy with the changes, merge the changes to your `main` branch.

To apply the changes to your production database, add `prisma migrate deploy` as part of your deployment/ build step in CI


### Run the data migration

Update the `package.json` file with the script to execute the data-migration file. Be sure to update the `20230417131956_add-status-column` with the name of your migration file.

```json file=package.json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "ts-node ./script.ts",
    "data-migration:add-status-column": "ts-node ./prisma/migrations/20230417131956_add-status-column/data-migration.ts"
  },
```

Next steps:

1. Push your changes to a remote origin and create a new pull request.
1. Once you’re happy with the changes, merge the changes to your “main” branch.

To apply the changes to your production database, add `prisma migrate deploy` as part of your deployment/ build step in CI.

### Run the data migration

Update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with your production database's URL. Run the data migration script:

```bash
npm run data-migration:add-status-column
```

## Contract your schema by dropping the old column

Checkout to a separate branch on your development machine:

```bash
git checkout -b drop-published-column
```

Delete the `published` field from your schema and generate a new migration:

```prisma highlight=12;delete
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean? @default(false)
  status    Status   @default(Unknown)
  author    User?    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

enum Status {
  Draft
  InProgress
  InReview
  Published
}
```

Generate a new migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name drop-published-column
```

Next steps:

1. Push your changes to a remote origin and create a new pull request.
1. Once you’re happy with the changes, merge the changes to your `main` branch.

To apply the changes to your production database, add `prisma migrate deploy` as part of your deployment/ build step in CI


```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name drop-published-column
```

You have successfully:

- Migrated data from the `published` to `status` column
- Dropped the `published` column from your schema
