This guide explains how to set up and deploy a serverless Node.js REST API to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) with the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/).

AWS Lambda is part of the AWS cloud platform. You can use it to run your code in a serverless environment. To deploy a REST API to AWS Lambda, you must also use [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to host the files and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) to expose the API over HTTP.

The Serverless Framework simplifies deployment to Lambda. It provides a CLI that helps with workflow automation and AWS resource provisioning.

This guide uses the [Prisma AWS example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/deployment-platforms/aws-lambda), which has example REST endpoints preconfigured as serverless functions. The Prisma AWS example uses Prisma Client to fetch, create, and delete records from a database. Each function represents a REST resource endpoint and uses Prisma Client to handle database operations against a PostgreSQL database. In this guide, we explain how to host your database on Supabase, but you can use a platform of your choice.

<details><summary>If you deploy GraphQL servers to AWS Lambda</summary>

This example uses REST, but the same principles apply to a GraphQL server.<br /><br />The main difference is that you typically only need a single function to serve a
GraphQL API. In that function, set the `context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop` of the [AWS Lambda Context Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-context.html) to `false` as follows:

```js
exports.server = (event, context, cb) => {
  // Set to false to send the response right away when
  // the callback executes. Don't wait for the Node.js
  // event loop to be empty.
  context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop = false

  return lambda.graphqlHandler(event, context, cb)
}
```

## Prerequisites

- A hosted PostgreSQL database and a URL from which your application can access it, such as `postgresql://username:password@your_postgres_db.cloud.com/db_identifier` (you can use Supabase, which offers a [free plan](https://dev.to/prisma/set-up-a-free-postgresql-database-on-supabase-to-use-with-prisma-3pk6)).
- An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account and a corresponding [access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) for programmatic access.
- A [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) installed. See the note below about [Serverless Framework CLI commands](#serverless-framework-cli-commands).
- PostgreSQL CLI `psql` installed.
- Node.js installed.

### Serverless Framework CLI commands

The exact Serverless Framework commands that you must use depend on the way that you install the Serverless Framework CLI.

- If you install the Serverless Framework CLI globally, then you can use the commands exactly as shown in this guide.

- If you install the Serverless Framework CLI in your project, then you must prepend `npx` to the commands in this guide. For example:

  ```terminal wrap
  npx serverless config credentials --provider aws --key AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  --secret AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  ```

## Prisma workflow

In this guide, you do the following:

- Use Prisma and a Prisma schema file (`schema.prisma`) to create a schema for the database
- Use `prisma db push` to push this Prisma schema to the database

In this guide, you use `prisma db push` to push the initial Prisma schema to the database. For a real project, you would typically start with a development database and use `prisma db push` as we suggest here. You can continue with `prisma migrate dev`, which generates a migration script for each change that you make to the Prisma schema. With multiple migration scripts, you build a migration history for your database and that makes it easy to later apply the changes to a production database with `prisma migrate deploy`. For more information, see [Prisma Migrate](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate). <br></br><br></br>If you use Supabase to host your database, then when you use `prisma migrate` you must set up a shadow database. For details, see the [Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/prisma).

## 1. Download the example project

To start, download the example project. The project includes the configuration that you need to complete this guide.

### Steps

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to a location of your choice. Use the following commands to create a directory for the project and download the example code:

   ```terminal wrap
   mkdir prisma-aws-lambda
   cd prisma-aws-lambda
   curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=3 prisma-examples-latest/deployment-platforms/aws-lambda/
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```terminal
   npm install
   ```

<!-- tar strip folder is a concatenation of the REPOSITORY-BRANCH/REF, e.g. prisma-examples-latest -->

### Result

Your directory contains the following files:

```terminal no-copy
README.md
handlers
node_modules
package-lock.json
package.json
prisma
schema.sql
serverless.yml
```

## 2. Set the DATABASE_URL in <inlinecode>.env</inlinecode>

The Lambda functions need the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to access the database. You must define an `.env` file. The preconfigured `serverless-dotenv-plugin` uses this file to inject into the function runtime.

The repository contains an `.env.example` example file to help with this.

### Steps

1. Enter the following command to copy `.env.example` to a new file, `.env`:

   ```terminal
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open `.env` and set the `DATABASE_URL` to your database credentials. The format is as follows:

   ```file
   DATABASE_URL="postgres://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__"
   ```

   Replace the uppercase placeholders with your database credentials. For example:

   ```file
   DATABASE_URL="postgres://janedoe:randompassword@yourpostgres.supabase.co:6543/yourdbname"
   ```

   > **Note:** If your connection URL contains any special characters, then you must [percentage encode them](/reference/database-reference/connection-urls#special-characters).

> **Note:** It's best practice to keep secret information, such as `DATABASE_URL`, out of your git repository. To do this, add your `.env` file to `.gitignore`. This guide copies the source and does not create a repository, so you only need to update `.gitignore` if you initialize a repository.

## 3. Push the Prisma schema to the database

`prisma db push` takes the models and attributes that you define in `schema.prisma` and pushes them to the database.

### Steps

```terminal
npx prisma db push
```

This command also generates Prisma Client based on your Prisma schema.

### Result

Prisma applies the models that are defined in `schema.prisma` to the database.

### What's next

Use Prisma Studio to inspect your database and confirm that the tables are set up according to the schema.

Open Prisma Studio:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

Your database has three models: `Post`, `Profile`, and `User`.

## 4. Set your AWS Access key as an environment variable

In order for the Serverless Framework to provision the AWS resources and deploy your application, you must configure your access key.

The method you use to get the access key depends on whether you use your personal account or create a special IAM user for the Serverless Framework. We recommend that you create a special IAM user because it lets you set granular permissions. To get an access key for your account, follow the [AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey)

When you have the _Access key ID_ and a _Secret access key_, set them with the following command. In the following command, replace the placeholders with your _Access key ID_ and _Secret access key_.

Use the following command:

```terminal wrap
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  --secret AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Result

If the configuration is successful, you see the following result in the terminal.

```terminal
✔ Profile "default" has been configured
```

## 5. Deploy your project

You have finished the configuration, so you can now deploy your project with `serverless deploy`.

### Steps

Use the following command:

```terminal
serverless deploy
```

### Result

Serverless creates the AWS resources and uploads your code, then outputs the service information. For example:

```code no-copy
Service Information
service: prisma-aws-lambda-example
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
stack: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev
resources: 39
api keys:
  None
endpoints:
  GET - https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/
  GET - https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/seed
  GET - https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/users
  POST - https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/users
  GET - https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/posts
functions:
  status: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev-status
  seed: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev-seed
  getUsers: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev-getUsers
  createUser: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev-createUser
  getPosts: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev-getPosts
layers:
  None
```

### What's next

You can now test the deployment with a call to the status endpoint. Use the following command and replace `UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER` with the corresponding part of the URL from the output you got from `serverless deploy`.

```terminal
curl https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/
```

This returns the following:

```terminal no-copy
{"up":true}
```

## 6. Test your deployed REST API

With the API base URL `https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/`, you can test the API's endpoints:

| Endpoint      | Description                                                                                                              | Implementation            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `GET /`       | Status                                                                                                                   | `handlers/status.js`      |
| `GET /seed`   | Delete all database records and seed the database with test `users`, `profiles`, and `posts`. Returns the created users. | `handlers/seed.js`        |
| `GET /users`  | Fetch all `users` in the database with their related `profiles`                                                          | `handlers/users.js`       |
| `POST /users` | Create a single `users` in the database                                                                                  | `handlers/create-user.js` |
| `GET /posts`  | Fetch all `posts` and their related `authors`                                                                            | `handlers/posts.js`       |

To call the API, you can use curl. For example, the following command calls the `seed` endpoint. Replace `UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER` with the corresponding part of the URL from the output of `serverless deploy` in step 6.

```terminal
curl -v https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/seed
```

<Admonition type = "info">

The `serverless.yml` configuration file contains the endpoint and function configuration. You can update this file to add or change endpoints. For more AWS specific configuration information, see the AWS provider configuration in the [Serverless Framework documentation](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/functions/).

## Deploy only the required files

To reduce your deployment footprint, you can change your deployment process so that you only upload the files that your application needs. The method for doing so depends on whether you use the Serverless Framework or not.

### If you use the Serverless Framework

You can use the Serverless configuration file to [deploy only the binary that your project needs](/guides/deployment/use-prisma-with-serverless-framework#reduce-the-package-footprint).

### If you do not use the Serverless Framework

If you do not use the Serverless Framework to deploy your project, you can use the following method to remove any unneeded files.

1. Create a zip script that only zips the files that your project needs. [Example script](https://github.com/prisma/ecosystem-tests/blob/dev/platforms-serverless/lambda/zip.sh).

2. Upload the zip. For example, to do this with the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), you might use a command similar to the following:

   ```terminal wrap
   aws lambda update-function-code --function-name my-function --zip-file "fileb://lambda.zip"
   ```

## Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the API to AWS Lambda.

For more information about how to use the Serverless Framework with Prisma projects, see [use Prisma with the Serverless Framework](/guides/deployment/use-prisma-with-serverless-framework).

For more insight into the Prisma Client API, look at the function handlers in the `handlers/` folder.

<Admonition type="info">

**A note on connection pooling**<br /><br />Generally, when you use a FaaS (function as a service) environment to interact
with a database, every function invocation can result in a new connection to the
database. This is not a problem with a constantly running node.js server.
Therefore, it is beneficial to pool DB connections to get better performance.
You can use the [Data Proxy](/data-platform/classic-projects/data-proxy) as a solution to this issue.
For other solutions, see the [connection management guide for
serverless
environments](/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#serverless-environments-faas).
