This guide explains how to avoid common issues when deploying a project using Prisma with [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/).

The Serverless Framework simplifies deployment to AWS Lambda. It provides a CLI that helps with workflow automation and AWS resource provisioning. While Prisma works well with the Serverless Framework "out of the box", there are a few improvements that can be made within your project to ensure a smooth deployment and performance. There is also additional configuration that is needed if you are using the [`serverless-webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-webpack) or [`serverless-bundle`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-bundle) libraries.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have an existing project using both Serverless Framework and Prisma. For a guide on how to get started with Serverless Framework, we recommend [Setting Up Serverless Framework With AWS](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started).

## Binary targets in <inlinecode>schema.prisma</inlinecode>

The Prisma schema should contain the following in the `generator` block:

```prisma
binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-1.0.x"]
```

This is necessary because the runtime used in the development and when your application is deployed differ. Add the [`binaryTarget`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) to make the compatible Prisma engine file available.

### Lambda functions with arm64 architectures

Lambda functions that use [arm64 architectures (AWS Graviton2 processor)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-arch.html#foundation-arch-adv) must use an `arm64` precompiled engine file.

In the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, add the following:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-arm64-openssl-1.0.x"]
```

## Loading environment variables via a <inlinecode>.env</inlinecode> file

Your functions will need the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to access the database. The `serverless-dotenv-plugin` will allow you to use your `.env` file in your deployments.

First, make sure that the plugin is installed:

```sh
npm install -D serverless-dotenv-plugin
```

Then, add `serverless-dotenv-plugin` to your list of plugins in `serverless.yml`:

```code file=serverless.yml no-copy
plugins:
  - serverless-dotenv-plugin
```

The environment variables in your `.env` file will now be automatically loaded on package or deployment.

<CodeWithResult expanded="{true}">
<cmd>

```sh
serverless package
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```sh no-copy
Running "serverless" from node_modules
DOTENV: Loading environment variables from .env:
         - DATABASE_URL

Packaging deployment-example-sls for stage dev (us-east-1)
.
.
.
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

## Connection pooling

Generally, when you use a FaaS (Function as a Service) environment to interact with a database, every function invocation can result in a new connection to the database. This is not a problem with a constantly running Node.js server. Therefore, it is beneficial to pool DB connections to get better performance. You can use [Accelerate](/data-platform/accelerate) to solve this issue. For other solutions, see the [connection management guide for serverless environments](/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#serverless-environments-faas).

## Deploy only the required files

To reduce your deployment footprint, you can update your deployment process to only upload the files your application needs. The Serverless configuration file, `serverless.yml`, below shows a `package` pattern that includes only the Prisma engine file relevant to the Lambda runtime and excludes the others. This means that when Serverless Framework packages your app for upload, it includes only one engine file. This ensures the packaged archive is as small as possible.

```code file=serverless.yml no-copy
package:
  patterns:
    - '!node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*'
    - 'node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-rhel-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/libquery_engine-*'
    - '!node_modules/@prisma/engines/**'
```

If you are deploying to [Lambda functions with ARM64 architecture](#lambda-functions-with-arm64-architectures) you should update the Serverless configuration file to package the `arm64` engine file, as follows:

```code file=serverless.yml highlight=4;normal
package:
  patterns:
    - '!node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*'
    - 'node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-linux-arm64-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/libquery_engine-*'
    - '!node_modules/@prisma/engines/**'
```

If you use `serverless-webpack`, see [Deployment with serverless webpack](#deployment-with-serverless-webpack) below.

## Deployment with <inlinecode>serverless-webpack</inlinecode>

If you use `serverless-webpack`, you will need additional configuration so that your `schema.prisma` is properly bundled. You will need to:

1. Copy your `schema.prisma` with [`copy-webpack-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-webpack-plugin).
2. Run `prisma generate` via `custom > webpack > packagerOptions > scripts` in your `serverless.yml`.
3. Only package the correct Prisma engine file to save more than 40mb of capacity.

### 1. Install webpack specific dependencies

First, ensure the following webpack dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-node-externals copy-webpack-plugin serverless-webpack
```

### 2. Update <inlinecode>webpack.config.js</inlinecode>

In your `webpack.config.js`, make sure that you set `externals` to `nodeExternals()` like the following:

```javascript file=webpack.config.js highlight=1,5;normal;
const nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals')

module.exports = {
  // ... other configuration
  externals: [nodeExternals()],
  // ... other configuration
}
```

Update the `plugins` property in your `webpack.config.js` file to include the `copy-webpack-plugin`:

```javascript file=webpack.config.js highlight=2,7-13;normal;
const nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals')
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  // ... other configuration
  externals: [nodeExternals()],
  plugins: [
    new CopyPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: './node_modules/.prisma/client/schema.prisma', to: './' }, // you may need to change `to` here.
      ],
    }),
  ],
  // ... other configuration
}
```

This plugin will allow you to copy your `schema.prisma` file into your bundled code. Prisma requires that your `schema.prisma` be present in order make sure that queries are encoded and decoded according to your schema. In most cases, bundlers will not include this file by default and will cause your application to fail to run.

<Admonition>

Depending on how your application is bundled, you may need to copy the schema file to a location other than `./`. Use the `serverless package` command to package your code locally so you can review where your schema should be put.

</Admonition>

Refer to the [Serverless Webpack documentation](https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-webpack) for additional configuration.

### 3. Update <inlinecode>serverless.yml</inlinecode>

In your `serverless.yml` file, make sure that the `custom > webpack` block has `prisma generate` under `packagerOptions > scripts` as follows:

```yaml file=serverless.yml
custom:
  webpack:
    packagerOptions:
      scripts:
        - prisma generate
```

This will ensure that, after webpack bundles your code, the Prisma Client is generated according to your schema. Without this step, your app will fail to run.

Lastly, you will want to exclude [Prisma query engines](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-engines/query-engine) that do not match the AWS Lambda runtime. Update your `serverless.yml` by adding the following script that makes sure only the required query engine, `rhel-openssl-1.0.x`, is included in the final packaged archive.

```yaml file=serverless.yml highlight=6;add
custom:
  webpack:
    packagerOptions:
      scripts:
        - prisma generate
        -- find . -name "libquery_engine-*" -not -name "libquery_engine-rhel-openssl-*" | xargs rm
```

If you are deploying to [Lambda functions with ARM64 architecture](#lambda-functions-with-arm64-architectures) you should update the find command to the following:

```sh
find . -name "libquery_engine-*" -not -name "libquery_engine-arm64-openssl-*" | xargs rm
```

### 4. Wrapping up

You can now re-package and re-deploy your application. To do so, run `serverless deploy`. Webpack output will show the schema file being moved with `copy-webpack-plugin`:

<CodeWithResult expanded="{true}">
<cmd>

```sh
serverless package
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```sh no-copy
