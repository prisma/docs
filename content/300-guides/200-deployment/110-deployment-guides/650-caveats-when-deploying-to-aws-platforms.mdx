The following describes some caveats you might face when deploying to different AWS platforms.

## AWS RDS Proxy

Prisma is compatible with AWS RDS Proxy. However, there is no benefit in using it for connection pooling with Prisma due to the way RDS Proxy pins connections:

> "Your connections to the proxy can enter a state known as pinning. When a connection is pinned, each later transaction uses the same underlying database connection until the session ends. Other client connections also can't reuse that database connection until the session ends. The session ends when the client connection is dropped." - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy.html">AWS RDS Proxy Docs</a>

Prepared statements (of any size) or query statements greater than 16 KB cause RDS Proxy to pin the session. Because Prisma uses prepared statements for all queries, you won't see any benefit when using RDS Proxy with Prisma.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS-like deployment service that abstracts away infrastructure and allows you to deploy applications to AWS quickly.

When deploying an app using Prisma Client to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Prisma generates the Prisma Client code into `node_modules`. This is typically done in the `postinstall` hook.

Because Beanstalk limits the ability to write to the filesystem in the `postinstall` hook, you need to create an [`.npmrc`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/npmrc) file in the root of your project and add the following configuration:

```config file=.npmrc
unsafe-perm=true
```

Enabling `unsafe-perm` forces _npm_ to run as _root_, avoiding the filesystem access problem, thereby allowing the `prisma generate` command in the `postinstall` hook to generate code into `node_modules`.

### Error: @prisma/client did not initialize yet

This error happens because AWS Elastic Beanstalk doesn't install `devDependencies`, which means that it doesn't pick up the Prisma CLI. To remedy this you can either:

1. Add the `prisma` CLI package to your `dependencies` instead of the `devDependencies`. (Making sure to run `npm install` afterward to update the `package-lock.json`).
2. Or install your `devDependencies` on AWS Elastic Beanstalk instances. To do this you must set the AWS Elastic Beanstalk `NPM_USE_PRODUCTION` environment property to false.

## AWS Lambda upload limit

AWS Lambda defines an **deployment package upload limit**, which includes:

- All application code
- Binaries like the [Prisma query engine](../../../concepts/components/prisma-engines/query-engine)

The [deployment package (.zip) size limit for lambdas is 50MB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html). When you prepare a deployment package, remove any files that the function does not require in production to keep the final .zip as small as possible. This includes some [Prisma engine binaries](#deleting-prisma-engine-binaries-that-are-not-required).

### Deleting Prisma engine binaries that are not required

Prisma downloads additional engine binaries that are **not required** in production. You can delete the following files and folders:

1. The entire `node_modules/@prisma/engines` folder (refer to the [sample bash script](https://github.com/prisma/e2e-tests/blob/dev/platforms-serverless/lambda/zip.sh) used by the Prisma end-to-end tests)
1. The **native engine binary** from the `node_modules/.prisma/client`. For example, your schema might define the following `binaryTargets` if you develop on Debian (`native`) but deploy to AWS Lambda (`rhel-openssl-1.0.x`):

   ```prisma
   binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-1.0.x"]
   ```

   In this scenario:

   - Keep `node_modules/.prisma/client/query-engine-rhel-openssl-1.0.x`, which is the binary used by AWS Lambda
   - Delete `node_modules/.prisma/client/query-engine-debian-openssl-1.1.x`, which is only required locally
