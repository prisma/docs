If you need to deploy a serverless Node.js application that uses Prisma to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), you can follow the process in this guide. It includes the configuration of an application example that exposes a REST API and uses Prisma Client to handle fetching, creation, and deletion of records from a database.

Netlify is a cloud platform for continuous deployment, static sites, and serverless functions. Netlify integrates seamlessly with GitHub for automatic deployments upon commits. When you follow the steps below, you will use that approach to create a CI/CD pipeline that deploys your application from a GitHub repository.

The application has the following components:

- **Backend**: Serverless Node.js REST API with resource endpoints that use Prisma Client to handle database operations against a PostgreSQL database (e.g. hosted on Heroku).
- **Frontend**: Static HTML page to interact with the API.

![Prisma Netlify GitHub architecture diagram](images/500-01-deploy-to-netlify-architecture.png)

The focus of this guide is to show how Prisma integrates with Netlify. The starting point is the [Prisma Netlify example](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-netlify) that has a couple of REST endpoints preconfigured as serverless functions and a static HTML page.

With Netlify, the fundamental building block is a [**Site**](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/). Sites are typically connected to a Git repository and have a publicly accessible URL that looks like `https://site-name.netlify.app`. In this guide, you will connect a GitHub repository to a Netlify site.

## Prerequisites

- a GitHub account
- a hosted PostgreSQL database and a connection string for it, such as `postgresql://username:password@your_postgres_db.cloud.com/db_identifier` (you can use Supabase, which offers a [free plan](https://dev.to/prisma/set-up-a-free-postgresql-database-on-supabase-to-use-with-prisma-3pk6)).
- a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account connected to your GitHub account (Netlify needs access to the repository you will create as part of this guide).
- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) installed
- Node.js installed

## Prisma workflow

Prisma supports different workflows depending on whether you integrate with an existing database or create a new one from scratch. Regardless of the workflow, Prisma relies on the Prisma schema, that is, the `schema.prisma` file.

With an empty database in place, you continue with the Prisma workflow that involves pushing the data model defined in the `schema.prisma` file to the database and then generating Prisma Client.

The steps are outlined below.

1. Push the existing Prisma schema to your existing database using `prisma db push`.
2. Run `prisma generate` to generate the Prisma Client based on the Prisma schema.

## 1. Fork the <inlinecode>deployment-example-netlify</inlinecode> repository

To begin, fork the repository of the deployment example project [`deployment-example-netlify`](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-netlify).

With a forked repository, you create a copy of the repository to which you will be able to commit your own changes. Later, you will connect the forked repository to Netlify so that changes are automatically built and deployed.

### Steps

1. Go to [`deployment-example-netlify`](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-netlify) and click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to fork the repository:

   ![GitHub repository - click Fork button](images/500-02-deploying-to-netlify-example-repo-click-fork.png)

2. On the **Create a new fork** page, configure the forked repository.
   1. (Optional) From **Owner**, select a GitHub account or organization as the owner.
   2. (Optional) In **Repository name**, modify the repository name if necessary.
   3. Leave as selected **Copy the `main` branch only**.
3. Click **Create fork**.
   ![GitHub - Create a new fork page](images/500-03-deploying-to-netlify-example-repo-create-fork-page.png)

### Result

After the forking is complete, you should see the forked repository in your account, for example `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/deployment-example-netlify`.

## 2. Clone the fork and install dependencies

You need to clone the repository to a folder on your local filesystem to install all required npm packages.

### Steps

1. Open your terminal, navigate to a location of your choice and clone your fork of the `deployment-example-netlify`:

   ```terminal
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/deployment-example-netlify.git
   ```

2. After cloning the repository, install the dependencies:

   ```terminal
   cd deployment-example-netlify
   npm install
   ```

### Result

The cloned folder has the files and folders listed below

```code no-lines no-copy
README.md
functions/
netlify.toml
node_modules/
package.json
prisma/
public/
```

## 3. Get the database connection string

You need the database connection string to define the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

If you are using Supabase, follow the steps below.

### Steps

1. In Supabase, open your database project.
2. From the sidebar on the left, click **Project Settings**.
3. Under **Project Settings** on the left, select **Database**.
4. Under **Connection string**, click **Nodejs**.
5. Click the **Copy** button.
   ![Copy Supabase connection string](images/500-04-deploying-to-netlify-copy-supabase-connection-string.png)

**Result**

The database connection string has the following format:

```
postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__
```

For example:

```
postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@db.projectcode.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

## 4. Set the <inlinecode>DATABASE_URL</inlinecode> variable in a <inlinecode>.env</inlinecode> file

You can store local environment variables related to Prisma in an `.env` file. For example, instead of setting the database connection string as the local environment variable `DATABASE_URL`, you can keep it in an `.env` file.

### Steps

1. Create the `.env` file at the root of your project folder.

   ```terminal
   touch .env
   ```

   The example below shows the directory listing of the root project folder that contains the `.env` file.

   <CodeWithResult expanded={true}>

   <cmd>

   ```terminal
   ls -1a
   ```

   </cmd>

   <cmdResult>

   ```code no-copy
   .env
   .git/
   README.md
   functions/
   node_modules/
   package-lock.json
   package.json
   prisma/
   ```

   </cmdResult>

   </CodeWithResult>

1. Create the `.env` file in the local repository folder.
1. Add a line that defines `DATABASE_URL` with your database connection string.

   ```bash file=.env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@yourpostgres.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/yourdbname"
   ```

   The database connection string is now saved in the `.env` file.

1. Save and close `.env`.

### Result

With the help of the `dotenv` library, Prisma CLI loads the variables defined in the `.env` file into the environment. Later, when you run `prisma db push`, the command reads the environment variables.

<Tip>

As a best practice, add the `.env` file to `.gitignore` to prevent `git` from monitoring it and, therefore, avoid accidentally pushing it to a remote repository.

</Tip>

## 5. Push the Prisma schema to the database

In the Netlify deployment example repository, the `prisma/schema.prisma` file contains a pre-defined schema for the app. It defines the `Post`, `Profile`, and `User` models.

### Steps

```terminal
npx prisma db push
```

### Result

`prisma db push` creates the database tables and their relationships based on the models and relationships defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

## 6. Log in to Netlify

To start using Netlify CLI to create your application site, you must first log in to Netlify from the CLI.

### Prerequisites

In your default browser, you are logged in to Netlify with your account.

### Steps

1. Log in with the Netlify CLI.

   ```terminal
   netlify login
   ```

   In your default browser, a new tab is redirected to a Netlify page where you can authorize Netlify CLI to access Netlify on your behalf.

2. Click **Authorize**.

### Result

Netlify CLI is now authorized and you can now use that to create a Netlify site and connect it to the forked repository from the terminal.

When you run `netlify status`, you should see your account name and email.

```terminal
netlify status
──────────────────────┐
 Current Netlify User │
──────────────────────┘
Name: your name
Email: your@email.com
Teams:
  ....
```

## 7. Configure continuous deployment to Netlify

You can now create your Netlify site and configure continuous deployments for it.

### Steps

1. From the repository's folder, run `netlify init`.

   ```terminal
   netlify init
   ```

2. Use the configuration prompts to configure your Netlify site.

   ![Running netlify init to configure a new Netlify site](images/500-05-deploying-to-netlify-netlify-init-configure-site.png)

   1. Select `Create & configure a new site`.
   2. If prompted to select your team, pick the one in which Netlify will create the site.
   3. Give the site a unique name.
   4. Authorize Netlify with your GitHub account.<br />
      Netlify uses your GitHub account to configure notification webhooks and deploy keys and uses these to configure the continuous integration for the app.
   5. _Your build command_: `npm run build`
   6. _Directory to deploy_: `public`

### Result

The Netlify CLI should show the following:

```text
Site Created

Admin URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_SITE_NAME
URL:       https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app
```

> **Note:** You can change the build configuration in the `netlify.toml` file and the site name from the Netlify admin UI.

Netlify deploys your app for the first time to the designated URL. Also, your application is now configured for continuous deployments. Every time you make a push to the GitHub repository, Netlify starts a new build of the site.

You can call the API status endpoint with `curl` to veriy that your application is deployed.

```terminal
curl https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/status
```

The call should return: `{"up":true}`

You can open your app now, but you will see errors when you use options that connect to the database. Netlify does not yet have the database connection string in a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to establish a database connection.

You can now set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your Netlify site settings.

## 8. Expose the <inlinecode>DATABASE_URL</inlinecode> environment variable to functions

Because Prisma will connect to the database from your serverless functions, you need to expose the `DATABASE_URL` to the backend functions. You typically do this from the Netlify UI.

### Steps

1. Open the Netlify admin UI for the site. You can use Netlify CLI as follows:
   ```terminal
   netlify open --admin
   ```
2. Click **Site settings**:
   ![Netlify admin UI](images/500-06-deploying-to-netlify-site-settings.png)
3. Navigate to **Build & deploy** in the sidebar on the left and select **Environment**.
4. Click **Edit variables** and create a variable with the key `DATABASE_URL` and set its value to your database connection string.
   ![Netlify environment variables](images/500-07-deploying-to-netlify-environment-variables-settings.png)
5. Click **Save**.

## 9. Test the deployed app

You can now test the deployed application.

### Steps

Open the site with the Netlify CLI.

```terminal
netlify open:site
```

### Result

Your default browser opens the static frontend that you deployed.
The URL should look like this: `https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app`.

![Netlify application with Prisma deployed](images/500-08-deploying-to-netlify-application-deployed.png)

The four buttons allow you to make requests to the REST API and view the response:

- **Check API status**. Calls the REST API status endpoint that returns `{"up":true}`. The implementation code is in `functions/index.js`
- **Seed data**. Deletes all database records and loads the database with test data `users`, `profiles`, and `posts`. Returns the created users. The implementation code is in `functions/seed.js`
- **Load users with profiles**: Loads all `users` in the database with their related `profiles`. The implementation code is in `functions/getUsers.js`
- **Load Posts**: Loads `posts` and their related `authors`. The implementation code is in `functions/getPosts.js`

For example, when you slick Seed data, the application shows the following:

## Summary

You have successfully deployed an application that uses Prisma to Netlify.

For more insight into Prisma Client API, you can explore the function handlers in the `functions/` folder.

When you use a FaaS (function as a service) environment to interact with a database, it is beneficial to pool database connections for performance reasons. This is because every function invocation may result in a new connection to the database (this is not a problem with a constantly running node.js server).

You can use the [Data Proxy](/data-platform/data-proxy) for connection pooling and to reduce your Prisma Client bundle and avoid cold starts.

For more information on rest of the existing solutions, refer to the [connection management guide for serverless environments](/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#serverless-environments-faas).
