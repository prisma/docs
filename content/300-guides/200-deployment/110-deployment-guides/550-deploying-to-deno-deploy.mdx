Today you'll be building and deploying a simple application to Deno Deploy that uses Prisma to save every request to a PostgreSQL database for inspection later.

This guide covers Prisma CLI via Deno CLI, Prisma Client, Data Proxy, and Deno Deploy. Let's get started!

</TopBlock>

## Prerequisites

- Free [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) account
- Free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A PostgreSQL database
- Node.js & NPM installed
- Git installed
- [Deno installed](https://deno.land/manual@v1.26.2/getting_started/installation)

## 1. Set up your Application

Open your terminal and navigate to a location of your choice. Run the following commands to set up your application.

```terminal
mkdir prisma-deno-deploy
cd prisma-deno-deploy
deno run -A --unstable npm:prisma init
```

In the generated `prisma/schema.prisma`, add the following schema:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["deno"]
  output          = "../generated/client"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Log {
  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  level   Level
  message String
  meta    Json
}

enum Level {
  Info
  Warn
  Error
}
```

This data model will store incoming requests from your application.

Note that this already includes the preview feature flag `deno` to active the current preview support for Deno in Prisma Client, and that it defines a custom `output` location for your Prisma Client. This is also required for Deno applications.

In your `.env` file, replace the current placeholder connection string `postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public` with your actual PostgreSQL connection string.

## 2. Create the database schema

With the data model created and your database connection configured, you can now create the data model in your database:

```terminal
deno run -A --unstable npm:prisma db push
```

This command installs Prisma Client in your project. There is no `package.json` file yet, so the command also creates this file.

## 3. Generate a Prisma Client for Data Proxy

Next, generate a Prisma Client that connects through the [Data Proxy](/data-platform/data-proxy) over HTTP.

```terminal
deno run -A --unstable npm:prisma generate --data-proxy
```

## 4. Create your application and test it locally

You now have a database schema and a generated local Prisma Client. You can now create a minimal local Deno application. Create an `index.ts` with the following content:

```ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.140.0/http/server.ts";
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/client/deno/edge.ts'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function handler(request: Request) {
  const log = await prisma.log.create({
    data: {
      level: 'Info',
      message: `${request.method} ${request.url}`,
      meta: {
        headers: JSON.stringify(request.headers),
      },
    },
  })
  const body = JSON.stringify(log, null, 2);
  return new Response(body, {
    headers: { "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8" },
  });
}

serve(handler);
```

You cannot execute this script yet, because you lack the credentials for Data Proxy that let you use this Client with your database. In the next section, you will resolve this.

## 5. Create a repository and push to GitHub

To prepare for the steps ahead, [create a private repository](https://github.com/new) on GitHub.

![Create a private repository](./550-01-create-repo.png)

Next, initialize your repository, then push your changes to GitHub.

```terminal
git init -b main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/prisma-deno-deploy
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

You're ready to import your project into the Prisma Data Platform.

## 6. Import your Project into the Prisma Data Platform

The next step is to sign up for Prisma's [Data Proxy](/data-platform/data-proxy).

1. Sign up for a free [Prisma Data Platform account](https://cloud.prisma.io/).

   **Note**<br /><br />
   You need a GitHub account to sign up for the Prisma Data Platform.

   ![Signup for Prisma Data Platform](./450-02-signup-pdp.png)

2. Click **New Project** and then select **Import a Prisma repository**.
3. Fill in the repository and project details, and click **Next**.

   <!-- TODO redo -->

4. Connect the Prisma Data Platform to your database and set up the Data Proxy:
   1. Paste your PostgreSQL connection string.
   1. Under **Location**, select a Data Proxy location that is geographically close to your database location.
   1. Click **Create Project** to test the connection and set up the Data Proxy.
      
   You are greeted with a new connection string that starts with `prisma://`. 
5. Copy the `prisma://` connection string to your clipboard.

## 7. Set the Data Proxy Connection string in your environment

With the Data Proxy connection string known, you can replace the direct PostgreSQL connection string that you used to create the database schema in your `.env` file.

The Data Proxy Client does not read `.env` files by default, so you must run the following command to install `dotenv-cli` locally:

```
npm install dotenv-cli
```

You are now ready to test your script locally.

## 8. Test your script locally

Execute your script locally:

```terminal
npx dotenv -- deno run -A ./index.ts
```

In a web browser, open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/). This page writes your request to the database.

```
{
  "id": 3,
  "level": "Info",
  "message": "GET http://localhost:8000/",
  "meta": {
    "headers": "{}"
  }
}
```

Refresh the page a couple times to verify that it's working. Now if you click on the **Data Browser** tab on your Prisma Cloud project, you should see `Info` logs written to your database.

It's working locally!

## 9. Deploy to Deno Deploy

Finally we are ready to also deploy our tiny Deno application to Deno Deploy:

1. [https://dash.deno.com/new](https://dash.deno.com/new)
1. Select your GitHub organization or user, repository and branch
1. Select the "Automatic" deployment mode
1. Select `index.ts` as an entry point
1. Make sure that the project has a good name
1. "Add Env Variable" to add `DATABASE_URL` with the Data Proxy connection string
1. Click "Link"
1. Watch the deployment happen
1. When it is done, it will redirect to a project view
1. Click the blue "View" button on the top right to open your Deno Deploy deployment
1. See browser window showing same as locally

Visit your deployment URL. You'll see the following:

```
{
  "id": 5,
  "level": "Info",
  "message": "GET https://prisma-deno-deploy.deno.dev/",
  "meta": {
    "headers": "{}"
  }
}
```

You're all set! You've successfully deployed a Deno application written in TypeScript that uses Prisma to talk to your PostgreSQL database.

Give yourself a pat on the back, you deserve it!
