<TopBlock>

This guide takes you through the steps to set up and deploy a serverless application that uses Prisma to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The application uses Next.js to provide a serverless REST API, and Prisma Client to handle fetching, creating, and deleting records from a database.

Vercel is a cloud platform that hosts static sites and serverless functions. You can integrate a Vercel project with a GitHub repository to allow you to deploy automatically when you make new commits. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a full-stack React-based serverless framework that integrates seamlessly with Vercel.

The Next.js app has the following components:

- **Backend**: Next.js API routes that serve a REST API and use Prisma Client to handle database operations on a PostgreSQL database.
- **Frontend**: Next.js page to interact with the API.

This guide focuses on how to use Prisma with Next.js and Vercel. The starting point is the [Prisma Vercel example](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-vercel), which has four serverless REST endpoints configured as [Next.js API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and a Next.js page that allows you to call the endpoints and display data.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, make sure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- a [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- a hosted PostgreSQL database and a connection string for it, e.g. `postgresql://username:password@your_postgres_db.cloud.com/db_identifier` (you can use Supabase, which offers a [free plan](https://dev.to/prisma/set-up-a-free-postgresql-database-on-supabase-to-use-with-prisma-3pk6))
- a [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account
- Node.js installed

If you [add a separate database for preview deployments](#3-optional-add-a-separate-database-for-preview-deployments), you will also need:

- a second hosted PostgreSQL database and a connection string for it

## Prisma workflow

At the core of Prisma is the [Prisma schema](/concepts/components/prisma-schema) â€“ a file where you declaratively define your data model. The Prisma schema is a single source of truth for both Prisma Client and Prisma Migrate.

In this guide, you will create the database schema with [Prisma Migrate](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate). Prisma Migrate takes your changes to the data model in your Prisma schema, generates a SQL migration file with the changes and applies it to your database.

There are two main workflows for Prisma Migrate:

- You can create and apply migrations during _local_ development with `prisma migrate dev`
- You can apply the migrations to _production_ with `prisma migrate deploy`

For brevity, this guide does not cover how to create migrations with `prisma migrate dev`. Instead, it focuses on the production workflow with `prisma migrate deploy` and uses the Prisma schema and SQL migration that are included in the example code.

You will use Vercel's [build step](https://vercel.com/docs/build-step) to run the `prisma migrate deploy` command to apply the migrations before Vercel deploys the serverless functions.

To learn more about how to create migrations with Prisma Migrate, see our [Get Started guide](/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgres).

## 1. Create the project and deploy to Vercel

To begin, you will deploy the [`deployment-example-vercel`](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-vercel) example repository to Vercel. As part of the deployment steps, you will clone the GitHub repository and connect your application to your PostgreSQL database.

### Steps

1. Go to [`deployment-example-vercel`](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-vercel) and click the **Deploy** button.

   ![Vercel deploy button](images/300-10-deploy-to-vercel-deploy-button.png)

   <Admonition type="info">

   The [Deploy Button](https://vercel.com/docs/deploy-button) is a Vercel feature that allows you to deploy a project and clone the source Git repository to your own repository.

   </Admonition>

2. On the **Create Git Repository** screen, select **GitHub**.

   ![Select GitHub on the Create Git Repository screen](images/300-20-deploy-to-vercel-select-github.png)

3. Pick a repository name. This will be the name of the cloned repository in your GitHub account. In this guide, we use the name `prisma-vercel-example`:

   ![Pick a repository name](images/300-30-deploy-to-vercel-create-git-repo.png)

   <Admonition type="info">

   If this is your first time using Vercel, you will be prompted to install the Vercel app in your GitHub account.

   </Admonition>

4. Click **Create**.

5. On the **Configure Project** screen, set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the connection string for your PostgreSQL database:

   ![Configure the project](images/300-40-deploy-to-vercel-configure-project.png)

   The database connection string has the following format:

   ```code
   postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__
   ```

   For example, on Supabase it looks similar to:

   ```code
   postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@db.projectcode.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   ```

6. Click **Deploy**.

   Vercel will now deploy your application. The `package.json` file in the root directory of the example project uses a [`vercel-build` script](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/node-js#custom-build-step-for-node.js) to run `prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy && next build`. This generates Prisma Client, applies the migrations, and then builds the Next.js project. This ensures that the generated Prisma Client in `node_modules/@prisma/client` is available to the Next.js serverless functions.

### Result

When the build completes, you should see the following:

![Vercel deployment succeeded](images/300-50-deploy-to-vercel-success.png)

You have successfully deployed the app to Vercel. Note that Vercel will build and deploy further commits to your GitHub repository.

To check that the API returns data successfully, click on the image of the deployed application. This will take you to your application at `https://__PROJECT-NAME__.vercel.app/`, where `__PROJECT-NAME__` is the name that Vercel generates for the project.

When the page loads, click **Check API status**. If successful, you will see a result similar to the image below.

```code no-copy
{"up":true}
```

## 2. Test your deployed application

You can now test your application. Open your application at `https://__PROJECT_NAME__.vercel.app` to interact with the API.

### Steps

1. Click **Load users with profiles**.

   You do not yet have any data in the database, so the application returns an empty array:

   ```code no-copy
   []
   ```

   <Admonition type="info">

   This API call uses Prisma to get all `users` in the database with their related `profiles`. The code is in the `pages/api/users.js` file in the project repository.

   </Admonition>

2. Click **Seed data**.

   <Admonition type="info">

   This API call uses Prisma to delete any existing database records and load the database with test `users`, `profiles`, and `posts`, then returns the created `users`. The code is in the `pages/api/seed.js` file.

   </Admonition>

3. Click **Load users with profiles** again.

   This now returns the `users` and `profiles` that you added in the previous step:

   ```code no-copy
   [
   {
   "id": 5,
   "email": "jane@prisma.io",
   "name": "Jane",
   "profiles": [
     {
       "id": 13,
       "bio": "Technical Writer",
       "userId": 5
     },
     {
       "id": 14,
       "bio": "Health Enthusiast",
       "userId": 5
     },
     {
       "id": 15,
       "bio": "Self Quantifier",
       "userId": 5
     }
   ]
   },
   {
   "id": 6,
   "email": "toru@prisma.io",
   "name": "Toru Takemitsu",
   "profiles": [
     {
       "id": 16,
       "bio": "Composer",
       "userId": 6
     },
     {
       "id": 17,
       "bio": "Musician",
       "userId": 6
     },
     {
       "id": 18,
       "bio": "Writer",
       "userId": 6
     }
   ]
   }
   ]
   ```

4. Click **Load posts**.

   This returns the following output:

   ```code no-copy
   [
   {
   "id": 11,
   "content": "https://www.prisma.io/blog/comparison-of-database-models-1iz9u29nwn37/",

   "id": 15,
   "content": "",
   "title": "Waves for clarinet, horn, two trombones and bass drum ",
   "authorId": 6,
   "author": {
     "id": 6,
     "email": "toru@prisma.io",
     "name": "Toru Takemitsu"
   }
   }
   ]
   ```

   <Admonition type="info">

   This API call uses Prisma to get all `posts` in the database with their related `authors`. The code is in the `pages/api/posts.js` file.

   </Admonition>

### Result

You have now tested the API for your application and added data to your database.

## 3. (Optional) Add a separate database for preview deployments

Your application currently has a single _production_ environment, associated with the `main` Git branch of your repository. If you open a pull request to change your application, Vercel creates a new _preview_ environment.

By default, Vercel uses the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable that you defined when you imported the project for both the production and preview environments. This causes problems if you create a pull request with a database schema migration, because the pull request will change the schema of the production database.

In this section you associate a second PostgreSQL database with a Vercel preview environment.

### Steps

1. Click the **Settings** tab of your Vercel project.

2. Click **Environment variables**.

3. Add an environment variable with a key of `DATABASE_URL` and select only the **Preview** environment option:

   ![Add an environment variable for the preview environment](images/300-60-deploy-to-vercel-preview-environment-variable.png)

4. Set the value to the connection string of your second PostgreSQL database. As before, the connection string has the following format:

   ```code
   postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__
   ```

5. Click **Save**.

### Result

You should see the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for the preview environment in your list of environment variables:

![List of environment variables](images/300-70-deploy-to-vercel-environment-variables.png)

## Summary

You have successfully deployed your application to Vercel.

For more insight into the Prisma Client API, look at the function handlers in the [`api/` directory](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-vercel/tree/main/pages/api) of the example repository.

<Admonition type="info">

**A note on connection pooling**<br /><br />Generally, when you access a database with serverless functions, we recommend you use a connection pooler for scalability because every function invocation might result in a new connection to the database. This is not a problem with a constantly running Node.js server.
Therefore, it is beneficial to pool DB connections to get better performance.<br /><br />You can use the [Data Proxy](/data-platform/data-proxy) for connection pooling, to reduce your Prisma Client bundle size, and to avoid cold starts.<br /><br />For more information on other solutions, see our [connection management guide for serverless environments](/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#serverless-environments-faas).
