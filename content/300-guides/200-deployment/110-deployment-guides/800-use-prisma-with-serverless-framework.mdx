<TopBlock>

If you use Prisma with AWS Lambda, you can use the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/) to help deploy your projects. It provides a CLI that helps with workflow automation and AWS resource provisioning. For an introduction, see [our AWS Lambda and Serverless Framework deployment guide](/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-aws-lambda).

This page contains additional information about how to use the Serverless Framework to deploy your Prisma projects to AWS Lambda.

## Binary targets in <inlinecode>schema.prisma</inlinecode>

The Prisma schema contains the following in the generator block:

```prisma
binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-1.0.x"]
```

This is necessary because the local runtime is different from the Lambda runtime. Add the [`binaryTarget`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) to make the compatible Prisma engine binary available.

### Lambda functions with arm64 architectures

Lambda functions that use [arm64 architectures (AWS Graviton2 processor)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-arch.html#foundation-arch-adv) must use an `arm64` precompiled binary.

In the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, add the following:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-arm64-openssl-1.0.x"]
```

Update the Serverless configuration file to package the `arm64` binary, as follows:

```code file=serverless.yml
package:
  patterns:
    - '!node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*'
    - 'node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-linux-arm64-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/libquery_engine-*'
    - '!node_modules/@prisma/engines/**'
```

## Reduce the package footprint

The Serverless configuration file `serverless.yml` includes a package pattern that includes only the Prisma engine binary relevant to the Lambda runtime, and excludes the others. This means that when Serverless packages your app for upload, it includes only one binary. This ensures the packaged archive is as small as possible.

```code file=serverless.yml no-copy
package:
  patterns:
    - '!node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*'
    - 'node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-rhel-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/libquery_engine-*'
    - '!node_modules/@prisma/engines/**'
```

However, if you use `serverless-webpack`, then you cannot use this method. See [Deployment with serverless webpack](#deployment-with-serverless-webpack) for details.

## Deployment with <inlinecode>serverless-webpack</inlinecode>

If you use `serverless-webpack`, then you can use the [serverless-webpack-prisma](https://github.com/danieluhm2004/serverless-webpack-prisma) plugin without any additional configuration. `serverless-webpack-prisma` does the following:

1. Copies your `schema.prisma` with the Webpack plugin.
2. Runs the `prisma generate` command. This means that there is no need to add the command to the webpack options separately.
3. Packages the correct Prisma engine binary. This can save more than 40mb of capacity.

<details><summary>If you do not use webpack yet</summary>

Install the dependencies as follows:

```sh
npm install -D webpack serverless-webpack webpack-node-externals
```

If your project uses TypeScript, install `ts-loader`:

```sh
npm install -D ts-loader
```

Create a `webpack.config.js` file in the project root directory, and paste in the following configuration:

```javascript file=webpack.config.js
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-var-requires */
const path = require('path')
const nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals')
const slsw = require('serverless-webpack')
const { isLocal } = slsw.lib.webpack

module.exports = {
  target: 'node',
  stats: 'normal',
  entry: slsw.lib.entries,
  externals: [nodeExternals()],
  mode: isLocal ? 'development' : 'production',
  optimization: { concatenateModules: false },
  resolve: { extensions: ['.js'] },
  output: {
    libraryTarget: 'commonjs',
    filename: '[name].js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, '.webpack'),
  },
}
```

If you use TypeScript, insert the following configuration inside `exports`:

```javascript file=webpack.config.js
// ...initial config
module.exports = {
  // ...initial config
  resolve: { extensions: ['.js', '.ts'] },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        loader: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
    ],
  },
  // ...initial config
}
```

Refer to the [Serverless Webpack documentation](https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-webpack) for additional configuration.

</details>

To install the dev dependency, use the following command:

```sh
npm install -D serverless-webpack-prisma serverless
```

In `serverless.yml`, add `serverless-webpack` to the plugins list, as follows:

```yaml file=serverless.yml
plugins:
  - serverless-webpack
  - serverless-webpack-prisma

custom:
  webpack:
    includeModules: true
```

`serverless-webpack-prisma` automatically runs `prisma generate` so that you do not need to use the webpack script option separately as shown below.

```yaml file=serverless.yml
custom:
  webpack:
    packagerOptions:
      scripts:
        - prisma generate
```

`serverless-webpack-prisma` removes the unnecessary dependencies and packages the correct Prisma engine binary. Therefore, delete it in the `package.patterns` configuration in your `serverless.yml` file.

```yaml file=serverless.yml
package:
  patterns:
    - '!node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*'
    - 'node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-rhel-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/libquery_engine-*'
    - '!node_modules/@prisma/engines/**'
```

Now redeploy your application. To do so, run `serverless deploy`. The deployment output shows you that the correct Prisma engine binary is packaged and distributed, as follows:

```code no-copy
Serverless: Copy prisma schema for app...
Serverless: Generate prisma client for app...
Serverless: Remove unused prisma engine:
Serverless: - node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-darwin.dylib.node
Serverless: - node_modules/@prisma/engines/libquery_engine-darwin.dylib.node
Serverless: - node_modules/@prisma/engines/migration-engine-darwin
Serverless: - node_modules/@prisma/engines/prisma-fmt-darwin
Serverless: Copying existing artifacts...
```
