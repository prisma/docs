There are two scenarios where you might consider deploying migrations directly from a local environment to a production environment.

- You have a local CI/CD pipeline
- You are [baselining](/guides/migrate/developing-with-prisma-migrate/add-prisma-migrate-to-a-project#baseline-your-production-environment) a production environment

This page outlines some examples of how you can do that and **why we would generally not recommend it**.

## Local CI/CD pipeline

If you do not have an automated CI/CD process, you can technically deploy new migrations from your local environment to production in the following ways:

1. Make sure your migration history is up to date. You can do this through running `prisma migrate dev`, which will generate a migration history from the latest changes made.
2. Swap your local connection URL for your production connection URL

```bash file=.env highlight=1;delete|3;add
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/my_local_database"

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/my_production_database"
```

3. Run `prisma migrate deploy`

<div style={{ margin: '2.5rem auto' }}>
  ⛔{' '}
  <strong>
    We strongly discourage this solution due to the following reasons
  </strong>
</div>

- You risk exposing your production database connection URL to version control.
- You may accidentally use your production connection URL instead and in turn **override or delete your production database**.

<div style={{ margin: '2.5rem auto' }}>
  ✅ <strong>We recommend setting up an automated CI/CD pipeline</strong>
</div>

The pipeline should handle deployment to staging and production environments, and use `migrate deploy` in a pipeline step. See the [deployment guides](./) for examples.

## Baselining a production database

When you add Prisma Migrate to an **existing database**, you must [baseline](/guides/migrate/developing-with-prisma-migrate/add-prisma-migrate-to-a-project#baseline-your-production-environment) the production database. Baselining is performed **once**, and can be done from a local instance.
