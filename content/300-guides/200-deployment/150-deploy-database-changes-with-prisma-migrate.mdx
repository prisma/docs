To apply pending migrations to development, staging, or testing environments, run the `migrate deploy` command as part of your CI/CD pipeline:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Exactly when to run `prisma migrate deploy` depends on your platform. For example, a simplified [Heroku](./deployment-guides/deploying-to-heroku) workflow includes:

1. Ensuring the `./prisma/migration` folder is in source control
2. Running `prisma migrate deploy` during the [release phase](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/release-phase)

Ideally, `migrate deploy` should be part of an automated CI/CD pipeline, and we do not generally recommend [running this command locally to deploy changes to a production database](./deployment-guides/deploying-migrations-from-a-local-environment) (for example, by temporarily changing the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable). It is not generally considered good practice to store the production database URL locally.

Beware that in order to run the `prisma migrate deploy` command, you need access to the `prisma` dependency that is typically added to the `devDependencies`. Some platforms like Vercel, prune development dependencies during the build, thereby preventing you from calling the command. This can be worked around by making the `prisma` a production dependency, by moving it to `dependencies` in your `package.json`.
