## Overview

In this guide, you will set up and deploy a serverless Node.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home). The application will expose a REST API and use Prisma Client to handle fetching, creating, and deleting records from a database.

Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. Vercel integrates with a GitHub repository for automatic deployments upon commits.

The application has the following components:

- **Backend**: Serverless Node.js REST API with resource endpoints that use Prisma Client to handle database operations against a PostgreSQL database (e.g., hosted on Heroku).
- **Frontend**: Static HTML page to interact with the API.

The focus of this guide is showing how Prisma integrates with Vercel. The starting point will the [Prisma Vercel example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/deployment-platforms/vercel), which has a couple of REST endpoints preconfigured as serverless functions and a static page.

> Throughout the guide, you'll find various **checkpoints** that enable you to validate whether you performed the steps correctly.

## Prerequisites

- Hosted PostgreSQL database and a URL from which it can be accessed, e.g. `postgresql://username:password@your_postgres_db.cloud.com/db_identifier` (you can use Heroku, which offers a [free plan](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1)).
- [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account.
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) installed.
- Node.js installed.

## Prisma workflow

Prisma supports different workflows depending on whether you integrate with an existing database or create a new one from scratch. Regardless of the workflow, Prisma relies on the Prisma schema, i.e. `schema.prisma` file.

This guide starts with an empty database created with the Prisma `db push` command and looks as follows:

1. Define the database schema using the Prisma schema.
1. Define the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable pointing to the database.
1. Run `prisma db push --preview-feature` to create the database schema.
1. Run `prisma generate` to generate Prisma Client based on the Prisma schema.

## 1. Download the example and install dependencies

Open your terminal and navigate to a location of your choice. Create the directory that will hold the application code and download the example code:

```terminal
mkdir prisma-vercel
cd prisma-vercel
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=3 prisma-examples-latest/deployment-platforms/vercel/
```

<!-- tar strip folder is a concatenation of the REPOSITORY-BRANCH/REF, e.g. prisma-examples-latest -->

**Checkpoint:** `ls -1` should show:

```terminal
ls -1
README.md
api/
package.json
prisma/
public/
vercel.json
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## 2. Create a Git repository for the application

In the previous step, you downloaded the code. In this step, you will create a repository from the code so that you connect it to Vercel for automatic deployment.

To do so, run `git init` from the source code folder:

```no-lines
git init
> Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/alice/prisma-vercel/.git/
```

To use the `main` branch as the default branch, run the following command:

```no-lines
git branch -M main
```

With the repository initialized, add and commit the files:

```no-lines
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

**Checkpoint:** `git log -1` should show the commit:

```no-lines
git log -1
commit 895534590fdd260acee6396e2e1c0438d1be7fed (HEAD -> main)
```

## 3. Create the GitHub Repository

In this step, you will create a GitHub repository for your project and push your changes so that the app can be automatically deployed from GitHub to Vercel.

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) to create a new repository. For consistency, name the repository **prisma-vercel** and then click **Create repository**.

After the repository was created, push the changes with the following commands, which includes renaming the default local branch to `main`:

```command
git remote add origin git@github.com:your_github_username/prisma-vercel.git
git branch -M main
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

**Checkpoint:** Open `https://github.com/your_github_username/prisma-vercel`, and you should see the files that you've pushed.

## 4. Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable locally

In this step, you will set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable locally so that you can create the database schema locally using Prisma.

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable locally:

```terminal
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__"
```

It's considered best practice to keep secrets out of your codebase. If you open up the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, you should see `env("DATABASE_URL")` in the _datasource_ block. By setting an environment variable, you keep secrets out of the codebase.

## 5. Create the database schema

With the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set, you will create the database schema using the [`prisma db push`](/reference/api-reference/command-reference#db-push) command.

> **Note:** While the `prisma db push` command creates the database schema for you. It's intended for quick prototyping. When working on a production project with multiple environments, Prisma Migrate gives you more control over how the database schema is created and evolved.

Run the following command to create the database schema:

```no-lines
npx prisma db push --preview-feature
```

> **Note:** The `db push` command is currently in [Preview](/about/releases#preview). This means that it is not recommended to use in production.

**Checkpoint:** The `db push` should show the following

```no-lines
🚀  Your database is now in sync with your schema. Done in 99ms
```

## 7. Vercel login

Make sure you're logged in to Vercel with the CLI:

```terminal
vercel login
```

This will allow you to deploy to Vercel from the terminal.

**Checkpoint:** `vercel whoami` should show your username:

```terminal
vercel whoami
Vercel CLI 19.0.1
> your-username
```

## 8. Define Vercel secret and expose to functions

In step 4 you set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable on your machine. For the application to work, `DATABASE_URL` also needs to be available to Vercel's serverless functions.

Adding environment variables to Vercel requires two steps:

1. Defining a [Vercel secret](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/secrets) via the Vercel CLI with `vercel secrets add`.
2. Exposing the secret to your serverless functions in your `vercel.json` file.

```terminal
vercel secrets add database_url "$DATABASE_URL"
```

This uses the `$DATABASE_URL` environment variable defined in step 4.

Using the `vercel.json` configuration file, you can set Vercel related configuration, such as routing and environment variables. The `vercel.json` from the example will contain the configuration for making the secret available as an environment variable:

```json
// vercel.json
{
  // ...
  "env": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "@database_url"
  },
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "DATABASE_URL": "@database_url"
    }
  }
}
```

The configuration exposes the Vercel secret `database_url` as an environment variable named `DATABASE_URL` to both the build and run time. Prisma will use `DATABASE_URL` to connect to your database whenever the functions run.

## 9. Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy

Now that you created the database schema and set the `DATABASE_URL` secret on Vercel, you will connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy the app.

Open the [Vercel New Project page](https://vercel.com/new) in your browser:

![New Project Page on Vercel](https://imgur.com/v5SW2ej.png)

> **Note:** If this is your first time using Vercel with GitHub, you might be prompted to allow Vercel to access your GitHub repositories.

Click on **Import**, and select the Vercel scope to which you want to deploy the app. This will lead you to the _Import Project_ page:

![Import Project Page](https://imgur.com/onCpN15.png)

Click **Import** which will lead you to the following page:

![Import Project Page 2](https://imgur.com/aHBm4sy.png)

Since you've already configured the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, go ahead and click **Deploy**, which will start building and deploying the last commit from the GitHub repository that you created.

Once the build completes and your app has been deployed, you should see the following:

![Vercel successful deployment](https://imgur.com/P6XnfD7.png)

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the app to Vercel. Further commits to the GitHub repository will be automatically deployed to Vercel.

**Checkpoint:** Open the deployed app by clicking on **Visit** and click
The call should return: `{"up":true}`

## 10. Test your deployed application

You can use the static frontend to interact with the API you deployed.

Using the deployed app URL from the previous step (`https://PROJECT_NAME.VERCEL_USERNAME.vercel.app`), you should see the following:

![deployed-screenshot](https://imgur.com/lIkby4S.png)

The four buttons allow you to make requests to the REST API and view the response:

- **Check API status**: Will call the REST API status endpoint that returns `{"up":true}`. The implementation code is in `api/index.js`
- **Seed data**: Will delete all database records and load the database with test data `users`, `profiles`, and `posts`; returns the created users. The implementation code is in `api/seed.js`
- **Load users with profiles**: Will load all `users` in the database with their related `profiles`. The implementation code is in `api/getUsers.js`
- **Load Posts**: Will load `posts` and their related `authors`. The implementation code is in `api/getPosts.js`

For example, calling seed data should show the following:

![deployed-seed-endpoint-screenshot](https://imgur.com/mThW4Na.png)

## Notes

The `package.json` uses the `postinstall` hook script to run `prisma generate`.
Typically this would go in the `build` step. Because Vercel caches `node_modules` after the dependencies are installed, the functions won't have access to the generated Prisma Client.
Generating the Prisma Client in `postinstall` ensures that the generated Prisma Client in `node_modules/@prisma/client` is available to the functions.

## Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the application to Vercel.

For more insight into Prisma Client's API, look at the function handlers in the `api/` folder.

If you intend on deploying a Next.js app, the deployment process should look the same. The only difference is that that the framework preset will be set to _Next.js_ when creating the project in Vercel.

In the guide, you used `db push` to create the database schema. `db push` is convenient for quick prototyping. But as your app's complexity grows, you might want to have more control over how the database schema evolves with [Prisma Migrate](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate).

Finally, when accessing a database from serverless functions, it's recommended to use a connection pooler like PgBouncer for scalability because every function invocation may result in a new connection to the database.
