## Overview

In this guide, you will set up and deploy a serverless Node.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home). The application will expose a REST API and use Prisma Client to handle fetching, creating, and deleting records from a database.

Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. Vercel integrates with a GitHub repository for automatic deployments upon commits.

The application has the following components:

- **Backend**: Serverless Node.js REST API with resource endpoints that use Prisma Client to handle database operations against a PostgreSQL database (e.g., hosted on Heroku).
- **Frontend**: Static HTML page to interact with the API.

The focus of this guide is showing how Prisma integrates with Vercel. The starting point will the [Prisma Vercel example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/deployment-platforms/vercel), which has a couple of REST endpoints preconfigured as serverless functions and a static page.

> Throughout the guide, you'll find various **checkpoints** that enable you to validate whether you performed the steps correctly.

## Prerequisites

- Hosted PostgreSQL database and a URL from which it can be accessed, e.g. `postgresql://username:password@your_postgres_db.cloud.com/db_identifier` (you can use Heroku, which offers a [free plan](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1)).
- [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account.
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) installed.
- Node.js installed.

## Prisma workflow

Prisma supports different workflows depending on whether you integrate with an existing database or create a new one from scratch. Regardless of the workflow, Prisma relies on the Prisma schema, i.e. `schema.prisma` file.

In this guide you will start with an empty database and create the database schema with the Prisma `db push` command. The process looks as follows:

1. Define the database schema using the Prisma schema.
1. Define the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable pointing to the database.
1. Run `prisma db push --preview-feature` to create the database schema.
1. Run `prisma generate` to generate Prisma Client based on the Prisma schema.

## 1. Download the example and install dependencies

Open your terminal and navigate to a location of your choice.

Create the directory for the application code and download the example code:

```terminal
mkdir prisma-vercel
cd prisma-vercel
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=3 prisma-examples-latest/deployment-platforms/vercel/
```

<!-- tar strip folder is a concatenation of the REPOSITORY-BRANCH/REF, e.g. prisma-examples-latest -->

**Checkpoint:** `ls -1` should show:

```terminal
ls -1
README.md
api/
package.json
prisma/
public/
vercel.json
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## 2. Create a Git repository for the application

In the previous step, you downloaded the code. In this step, you will create a Git repository from the code which you will push to GitHub and connect to Vercel for automatic deployment.

To do so, run `git init` from the source code folder:

```no-lines
git init
> Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/alice/prisma-vercel/.git/
```

To use the `main` branch as the default branch, run the following command:

```no-lines
git branch -M main
```

With the repository initialized, add and commit the files:

```no-lines
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

**Checkpoint:** `git log -1` should show the commit:

```no-lines
git log -1
commit 895534590fdd260acee6396e2e1c0438d1be7fed (HEAD -> main)
```

## 3. Create the GitHub Repository

In this step, you will create a GitHub repository for your project and push your changes so that Vercel can automatically deploy the app from GitHub.

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) to create a new repository. For consistency, name the repository **prisma-vercel** and then click **Create repository**.

After you created the repository, push the changes with the following commands:

```command
git remote add origin git@github.com:your_github_username/prisma-vercel.git
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

**Checkpoint:** Open `https://github.com/your_github_username/prisma-vercel`, and you should see the files in the repository that you've pushed.

## 4. Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable locally

In this step, you will set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable locally so that you can create the database schema using Prisma.

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable locally:

```terminal
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__"
```

It's considered best practice to keep secrets out of your codebase. If you open up the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, you should see `env("DATABASE_URL")` in the _datasource_ block. By setting an environment variable, you keep secrets out of the codebase.

## 5. Create the database schema

With the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set, you will create the database schema using the [`prisma db push`](/reference/api-reference/command-reference#db-push) command.

> **Note:** While the `prisma db push` command creates the database schema for you. It's intended for quick prototyping. When working on a production project with multiple environments, Prisma Migrate gives you more control over how the database schema is created and evolved.

Run the following command to create the database schema:

```no-lines
npx prisma db push --preview-feature
```

> **Note:** The `db push` command is currently in [Preview](/about/releases#preview). This means that it isn't recommended to use in production.

**Checkpoint:** The `db push` should show the following

```no-lines
ðŸš€  Your database is now in sync with your schema. Done in 99ms
```

## 6. Vercel login

Make sure you're logged in to Vercel with the CLI:

```terminal
vercel login
```

This will allow you to deploy to Vercel from the terminal.

**Checkpoint:** `vercel whoami` should show your username:

```terminal
vercel whoami
Vercel CLI 19.0.1
> your-username
```

## 7. Define Vercel secret and expose to functions

In step 4 you set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable on your machine. For the application to work, `DATABASE_URL` also needs to be available to Vercel's serverless functions.

Adding environment variables to Vercel requires two steps:

1. Defining a [Vercel secret](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/secrets) via the Vercel CLI with `vercel secrets add`.
2. Exposing the secret to your serverless functions in your `vercel.json` file.

Define the Vercel secret:

```terminal
vercel secrets add database_url "$DATABASE_URL"
```

The command uses the `$DATABASE_URL` environment variable defined in step 4.

Using the `vercel.json` configuration file, you can set Vercel related configuration, such as routing and environment variables. The `vercel.json` from the example contains the configuration for making the secret available as an environment variable to your serverless functions:

```json
// vercel.json
{
  // ...
  "env": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "@database_url"
  },
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "DATABASE_URL": "@database_url"
    }
  }
}
```

The configuration exposes the Vercel secret `database_url` as an environment variable named `DATABASE_URL` to both the build and run time. Prisma will use `DATABASE_URL` to connect to your database whenever the functions run.

## 8. Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy

Now that you created the database schema and set the `DATABASE_URL` secret on Vercel, you will connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy the app.

Open the [Vercel New Project page](https://vercel.com/new) in your browser:

![New Project Page on Vercel](https://imgur.com/v5SW2ej.png)

> **Note:** If this is your first time using Vercel with GitHub, you will be prompted to allow Vercel to access your GitHub repositories.

Click on **Import**, and select the Vercel scope to which you want to deploy the app which will lead you to the _Import Project_ page:

![Import Project Page](https://imgur.com/onCpN15.png)

Click **Import** which will lead you to the following page:

![Import Project Page 2](https://imgur.com/aHBm4sy.png)

Go ahead and click **Deploy**. Vercel will build and deploy the last commit from your GitHub repository.

Once the build completes and your app is deployed, you should see the following:

![Vercel successful deployment](https://imgur.com/P6XnfD7.png)

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the app to Vercel. Note that Vercel will build and deploy further commits to your GitHub repository.

**Checkpoint:** Open the deployed app using the **Visit** button. Once the page loads, click on the **Check API status** button which should return: `{"up":true}`

## 9. Test your deployed application

You can use the static frontend to interact with the API you deployed.

Using the deployed app URL from the previous step (`https://PROJECT_NAME.VERCEL_USERNAME.vercel.app`), you should see the following:

![deployed-screenshot](https://imgur.com/lIkby4S.png)

The four buttons allow you to make requests to the REST API and view the response:

- **Check API status**: Will call the REST API status endpoint that returns `{"up":true}`. The implementation code is in `api/index.js`
- **Seed data**: Will delete all database records and load the database with test data `users`, `profiles`, and `posts`; returns the created users. The implementation code is in `api/seed.js`
- **Load users with profiles**: Will load all `users` in the database with their related `profiles`. The implementation code is in `api/getUsers.js`
- **Load Posts**: Will load `posts` and their related `authors`. The implementation code is in `api/getPosts.js`

For example, calling seed data should show the following:

![deployed-seed-endpoint-screenshot](https://imgur.com/mThW4Na.png)

## Notes

The `package.json` uses the `postinstall` hook script to run `prisma generate`.
Typically this would go in the `build` step. Because Vercel caches `node_modules` after the dependencies are installed, the functions won't have access to the generated Prisma Client.
Generating the Prisma Client in `postinstall` ensures that the generated Prisma Client in `node_modules/@prisma/client` is available to the functions.

## Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the application to Vercel.

For more insight into Prisma Client's API, look at the function handlers in the `api/` folder.

If you intend on deploying a Next.js app, the deployment process should look the same. The only difference is that that the framework preset will be set to _Next.js_ when creating the project in Vercel.

In the guide, you used `db push` to create the database schema which is convenient for quick prototyping. But as your app's complexity grows, you might want to have more control over how the database schema evolves with [Prisma Migrate](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate).

Finally, when accessing a database from serverless functions, it's recommended to use a connection pooler like PgBouncer for scalability because every function invocation may result in a new connection to the database.
