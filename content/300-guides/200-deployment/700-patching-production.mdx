metaDescription: How to reconcile the migration history after applying a hotfix or patch to a production environment.

<TopBlock>

Patching or hotfixing a database involves making an often time critical change directly in production. For example, you might add an index directly to a production database to resolve an issue with a slow-running query.

Patching the production database directly results in **schema drift**: your database schema has 'drifted away' from the source of truth, and is out of sync with your migration history. You can use the `prisma migrate resolve` command to reconcile your migration history _without_ having to remove and re-apply the hotfix with `prisma migrate deploy`.

## Reconciling your migration history with a patch or hotfix

The following scenario assumes that you made a manual change in production and want to propagate that change to your migration history and other databases.

To reconcile your migration history and database schema in production:

1. Replicate the change you made in production in the schema - for example, add an `@@index` to a particular model.
1. Generate a new migration and take note of the full migration name, including a timestamp, which is written to the CLI:(`20210316150542_retroactively_add_index`):

   <CodeWithResult expanded={true}>
   <Cmd>

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev --name retroactively-add-index
   ```

   </Cmd>
   <CmdResult>

    ```bash
    migrations/
    └─ 20210316150542_retroactively_add_index/
    └─ migration.sql

    Your database is now in sync with your schema.

    ✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.19.0-dev.29) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 190ms
    ```

   </CmdResult>
   </CodeWithResult>

1. Push the migration to production **without running `migrate deploy`**. Instead, mark the migration created in the previous step as 'already applied' so that Prisma Migrate does not attempt to apply your hotfix a second time:

   ```terminal
   prisma migrate resolve --applied "20201127134938-retroactively-add-index"
   ```

   This command adds the migration to the migration history table without running the actual SQL.

1. Repeat the previous step for other databases that were patched - for example, if you applied the patch to a staging database.

1. Propagate the migration to other databases that were not patched - for example, by committing the migration to source control and allowing your CI/CD pipeline to apply it to all databases.

> **Note**: The migration will not be applied to databases where it has been marked as already applied by the `prisma migrate resolve` command.
