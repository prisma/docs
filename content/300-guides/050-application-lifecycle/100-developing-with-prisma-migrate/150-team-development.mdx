metaDescription: How to use Prisma Migrate when collaborating on a project as a team.

<TopBlock>

To bring in changes to the database schema and migrations from collaborators:

1. Pull the changed Prisma Schema and `.prisma/migrations` folder
1. Run the `migrate dev` command to apply new migrations:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

When you check out migration history and run `migrate dev`, unapplied migrations are applied in the order they were created.

## Source control

Prisma Migrate requires the following files in source control:

* The contents of the `.prisma/migrations` folder, including the `migration_lock.toml` file
* The Prisma schema file (`schema.prisma`)
