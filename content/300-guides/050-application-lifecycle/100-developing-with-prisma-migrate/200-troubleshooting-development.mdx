## Handling migration history conflicts

A migration history conflict occurs when there are discrepancies between the **migrations folder in the file system** and the **`_prisma_migrations` table in the database**.

#### Causes of migration history conflict in a development environment

- A migration that has already been applied is later modified
- A migration that has already been applied is missing from the file system
- A migration fails

#### Fixing a migration history conflict in a development environment

If Prisma Migrate detects a migration history conflict when you run `prisma migrate dev`, the CLI will ask to reset the database. Resetting the database:

1. Drops the database
2. Recreates the database
3. Applies all migrations

## Schema drift

Database schema drift occurs when your database schema is out of sync with your migration history - the database schema has 'drifted away' from the source of truth.

#### Causes of schema drift in a development environment

Schema drift can occur if:

- The database schema was changed _without_ using migrations - for example, by using [`prisma db push`](../../../reference/api-reference/command-reference#db-push) or manually changing the database schema.

> **Note**: Schema drift can only be detected in a development environment as this requires the shadow database.

#### Fixing schema drift in a development environment

The following scenario assumes that you made a manual change in production and want to propagate that change to your migration history and other databases.

1. Make an equivalent change in the Prisma schema - for example, adding a field named `bio` and an index:

```prisma
model User {
    // Other fields
    bio   String?

    @@index([bio])
}
```

1. Create and apply the new migration in dev:

   ```terminal
   prisma migrate dev
   ```

1. Commit the new migration and allow your CI process to apply the migration to all other non-production databases.

## Failed migrations

#### Causes of failed migrations in a development environment

A migration might fail if:

- You [modify a migration before running it]() and introduce a syntax error
- You add a mandatory (`NOT NULL`) column to a table that already has data
- The migration process stopped unexpectedly
- The database shut down in the middle of the migration process

Each migration in the `_prisma_migrations` table has a `logs` column that stores the error.

#### Fixing failed migrations in a development environment

The easiest way to handle a failed migration in a developer environment is to address the root cause and reset the database. For example:

- If you introduced a SQL syntax error by manually editing the database, update the `migration.sql` file that failed and reset the database:

  ```terminal
  prisma migrate reset
  ```

- If you introduced a change in the Prisma schema that cannot be applied to a database with data (for example, a mandatory column in a table with data):

  1. Delete the `migration.sql` file.

  2. Modify the schema - for example, add a default value to the mandatory field.

  3. Migrate:

     ```terminal
     prisma migrate dev
     ```

     Prisma Migrate will prompt you to reset the database and re-apply all migrations.

- If something interrupted the migration process, reset the database:

  ```terminal
  prisma migrate reset
  ```
