## Overview

This upgrade guide describes how to migrate a Node.js project that's based on [Prisma 1](https://github.com/prisma/prisma1) and uses the [Prisma 1 client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-client/) to implement a REST API.

The guide assumes that you already went through the [guide for upgrading the Prisma layer](./upgrading-the-prisma-layer-postgres). This means you already:

- installed the Prisma 2 CLI
- created your Prisma 2 schema
- introspected your database and resolved potential schema incompatibilities
- installed and generated Prisma Client

The guide further assumes that you have a file setup that looks similar to this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── prisma
│   ├── datamodel.prisma
│   ├── docker-compose-mysql.yml
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── prisma.yml
│   └── seed.graphql
├── src
│   ├── generated
│   │   └── prisma-client
│   │       ├── index.ts
│   │       └── prisma-schema.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

The important parts are:

- A folder called with `prisma` with your Prisma 2 schema
- A folder called `src` with your application code

If this is not what your project structure looks like, you'll need to adjust the instructions in the guide to match your own setup.

## 1. Adjust the application to use Prisma Client 2

For the purpose of this guide, we'll use the sample API calls from the [`rest-express`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma1-examples/tree/master/typescript/rest-express) example in the [`prisma1-examples`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma1-examples/) repository.

The application code in our example is located in a single file and looks as follows:

```ts
import * as express from 'express'
import * as bodyParser from 'body-parser'
import { prisma } from './generated/prisma-client'

const app = express()

app.$use(bodyParser.json())

app.post(`/user`, async (req, res) => {
  const result = await prisma.createUser({
    ...req.body,
  })
  res.json(result)
})

app.post(`/post`, async (req, res) => {
  const { title, content, authorEmail } = req.body
  const result = await prisma.createPost({
    title: title,
    content: content,
    author: { connect: { email: authorEmail } },
  })
  res.json(result)
})

app.put('/publish/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.updatePost({
    where: { id },
    data: { published: true },
  })
  res.json(post)
})

app.delete(`/post/:id`, async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.deletePost({ id })
  res.json(post)
})

app.get(`/post/:id`, async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.post({ id })
  res.json(post)
})

app.get('/feed', async (req, res) => {
  const posts = await prisma.post({ where: { published: true } })
  res.json(posts)
})

app.get('/filterPosts', async (req, res) => {
  const { searchString } = req.query
  const draftPosts = await prisma.post({
    where: {
      OR: [
        {
          title_contains: searchString,
        },
        {
          content_contains: searchString,
        },
      ],
    },
  })
  res.json(draftPosts)
})

app.listen(3000, () =>
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000')
)
```

Consider each occurrence of the Prisma client instance `prisma` and replacing with the respective usage of Prisma Client 2. You can learn more in the [API Reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client).

### 1.1. Adjusting the import

Import the generated `@prisma/client` node module as shown:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
```

Note that this only imports the `PrismaClient` constructor, so you also need to instantiate a Prisma Client 2 instance:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

### 1.2. Adjusting the `/user` route (`POST`)

With the Prisma Client 2 API, the `/user` route for `POST` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.post(`/user`, async (req, res) => {
  const result = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      ...req.body,
    },
  })
  res.json(result)
})
```

### 1.3. Adjusting the `/post` route (`POST`)

With the Prisma Client 2 API, the `/post` route for `POST` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.post(`/post`, async (req, res) => {
  const { title, content, authorEmail } = req.body
  const result = await prisma.post.create({
    data: {
      title: title,
      content: content,
      author: { connect: { email: authorEmail } },
    },
  })
  res.json(result)
})
```

### 1.4. Adjusting the `/publish/:id` route (`PUT`)

With the Prisma Client 2 API, the `/publish/:id` route for `PUT` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.put('/publish/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.post.update({
    where: { id },
    data: { published: true },
  })
  res.json(post)
})
```

### 1.5. Adjusting the `/post/:id` route (`DELETE`)

With the Prisma Client 2 API, the `//post/:id` route for `DELETE` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.delete(`/post/:id`, async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.post.delete({
    where: { id },
  })
  res.json(post)
})
```

### 1.6. Adjusting the `/post/:id` route (`GET`)

With the Prisma Client 2 API, the `/post/:id` route for `GET` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.get(`/post/:id`, async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.post.findUnique({
    where: { id },
  })
  res.json(post)
})
```

### 1.7. Adjusting the `/feed` route (`GET`)

With the Prisma Client 2 API, the `/feed` route for `GET` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.get('/feed', async (req, res) => {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({ where: { published: true } })
  res.json(posts)
})
```

### 1.8. Adjusting the `/filterPosts` route (`GET`)

With the Prisma Client 2 API, the `/user` route for `POST` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.get('/filterPosts', async (req, res) => {
  const { searchString } = req.query
  const filteredPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
    where: {
      OR: [
        {
          title: { contains: searchString },
        },
        {
          content: { contains: searchString },
        },
      ],
    },
  })
  res.json(filteredPosts)
})
```
