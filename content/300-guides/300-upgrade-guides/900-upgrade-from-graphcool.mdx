## Overview

This guide explains how to upgrade from [Graphcool](https://graph.cool/) to Prisma 2.

> **Note**: The Graphcool servers have been shut down on July 1st. Please [reach out](mailto:burk@prisma.io) to us if you have any further questions.

## Considerations before upgrading

### BaaS vs Prisma

Prisma is not a _Backend-as-a-Service_ but a _next-generation ORM_. This means that it unfortunately can't provide the same level of convenience you're used to from Graphcool. When choosing Prisma for the future of your application, you will have to implement and host your own backend which includes the GraphQL API server as well as the database.

### Evolving the application and changing the database schema

Prisma unfortunately doesn't have a production-ready solution for running schema migrations against a database yet. This means that if you migrate to Prisma and want to evolve your application in the future, you'll need to migrate your database schema _manually_ using SQL or another migration tool like [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) (until [Prisma Migrate](../../concepts/components/prisma-migrate) is considered production-ready).

### Implementing an API server (including authentication & authorization)

We recommend using [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexusjs.org) with the [`nexus-plugin-prisma`](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus-plugin-prisma) to quickly expose GraphQL CRUD operations in your API server without much boilerplate.

However, in case you need to restrict data access in the API with dedicated authorization rules (i.e. permissions queries in Graphcool), this approach won't work and you will have to implement all queries and mutations individually and add your own authorization rules, e.g. using [`graphql-shield`](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield).

### Implementing GraphQL subscriptions

Prisma [doesn't have a realtime API](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/298) that could be used to implement GraphQL subscriptions. Subscriptions can be implemented by manually triggering them inside of a resolver or based on native database triggers.

### Upgrade alternatives

Because Graphcool and Prisma 2 are very different, it might be a viable option to migrate to another more BaaS-like provider, such as:

- [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/graphcool-migration)
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) (or [Nhost](https://nhost.io/))
- [8base](https://www.8base.com/)
- [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)

## Migration path

On a high-level, the migration path from Graphcool to Prisma 2 looks as follows:

1. Create SQL dump of Graphcool project using the [Graphcool Exporter](https://export.graph.cool/)
1. [Import](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/mysql/inserting-and-modifying-data/importing-and-exporting-data-in-mysql) the dump into a MySQL database
1. [Introspect](../../concepts/components/introspection) your database with Prisma 2.0
1. Create CRUD GraphQL API with [Nexus](https://nexusjs.org) (and optionally [`nexus-plugin-prisma`](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus-plugin-prisma))

## 1. Create a SQL dump of your Graphcool project

Open the Graphcool Exporter at [`https://export.graph.cool/`](https://export.graph.cool/).

Then grab your permanent auth token from the **Settings > Authentication > Permanent Auth Tokens** area in the [Graphcool console](https://console.graph.cool) and paste it into the text field. Now click **Export**.

This downloads a zipped `.sql` file with a dump of all the data that's stored in your Graphcool project.

## 2. Import the SQL dump into your own MySQL database

Follow the [guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/inserting-and-modifying-data/importing-and-exporting-data-in-postgresql#importing-data-from-sql-files) that explains how to import data into a MySQL database.

## 3. Introspect your database with Prisma 2

At this point, you have a MySQL database with the same data that you had in your Graphcool project. You can now setup your new npm project that you'll use to implement the GraphQL API:

```
npm init -y
```

With your new npm project in place, you can follow the [guide](../../../getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-postgres) that explains how to add Prisma to an existing project.

Note that Graphcool uses the same data modeling approach as Prisma 1. If you encounter any [schema incompatibilities](../upgrade-guides/upgrade-from-prisma-1/schema-incompatibilities-postgres), you can resolve them in the same way as if you were upgrading from Prisma 1.

## 4. Create CRUD GraphQL API

The last step in the migration process is to expose CRUD operations in your GraphQL API. The recommended approach for this is to use [Nexus](https://nexusjs.org) and the [`nexus-plugin-prisma`](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus-plugin-prisma). The plugin allows you to directly expose your Prisma models via GraphQL.

Once you installed the required dependencies in your project, you can add the `nexus-plugin-prisma` as follows:

```ts
import { use } from 'nexus'
import { prisma } from 'nexus-plugin-prisma'

|use(prisma({ migrations: false }))
```

The last line gives you access to the `t.model` and `t.crud` fields when defining your GraphQL schema with Nexus. Both fields enable you to

Here is an example, assume you have the following Prisma schema:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Category {
  id   String @id
  name String
  Post Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Post {
  authorId  String?
  content   String?
  createdAt DateTime   @default(now())
  id        String     @id
  published Boolean    @default(false)
  title     String
  updatedAt DateTime   @default(now())
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  bio  String?
  id   String  @id
  user String? @unique
  User User?   @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
}

model User {
  email    String?    @unique
  id       String     @id
  jsonData Json?
  name     String
  role     User_role? @default(CUSTOMER)
  Profile  Profile?
}

enum User_role {
  ADMIN
  CUSTOMER
}
```

Here's how you can ensure all your models are exposed via GraphQL:

```ts
schema.objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.email()
    t.model.name()
    t.model.jsonData()
    t.model.role()
    t.model.profile()
    t.model.posts({
      filtering: true,
      ordering: true,
    })
  },
})

schema.objectType({
  name: 'Post',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.createdAt()
    t.model.updatedAt()
    t.model.title()
    t.model.content()
    t.model.published()
    t.model.author()
    t.model.authorId()
    t.model.categories({
      filtering: true,
      ordering: true,
    })
  },
})

schema.objectType({
  name: 'Profile',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.bio()
    t.model.user()
    t.model.userId()
  },
})

schema.objectType({
  name: 'Category',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.name()
    t.model.posts({
      filtering: true,
      ordering: true,
    })
  },
})
```

Finally, you can expose CRUD operations for all your models via `t.crud` when defining your `Query` and `Mutation` types with Nexus. For example, if you want to enable all the CRUD operations for the `User` model, you can do it as follows:

```ts
schema.queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.crud.user()
    t.crud.users({
      pagination: true,
      filtering: true,
      ordering: true,
    })
  },
})

schema.mutationType({
  definition(t) {
    t.crud.createOneUser()
    t.crud.updateOneUser()
    t.crud.deleteOneUser()
  },
})
```
