title: Configure Prisma Client with PgBouncer
---

<TopBlock>

PgBouncer holds a connection pool to the database and proxies incoming client connections by sitting between Prisma Client and the database. This reduces the number of processes a database has to handle at any given time. PgBouncer passes on a limited number of connections to the database and queues additional connections for delivery when space becomes available.

## Add <inlinecode>pgbouncer</inlinecode> to the connection string

To use Prisma Client with PgBouncer from a serverless function, add the `?pgbouncer=true` flag to the PostgreSQL connection string:

```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?pgbouncer=true
```

## Set PgBouncer to transaction mode

Additionally, for Prisma Client to work reliably, PgBouncer must run in [**Transaction mode**](https://www.pgbouncer.org/features.html).

_Transaction mode_ offers a connection for every transaction – a requirement for the Prisma query engine to work with PgBouncer.

  <summary>How `pgbouncer` mode works in Prisma</summary>

- Prisma cleans up already present prepared statements in the connection by running `DEALLOCATE ALL` before preparing and executing Prisma Client queries.
- Prisma opens a transaction for every query case – even when just reading data, allowing Prisma to use prepared statements.
