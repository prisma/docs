title: Configure Prisma Client with PgBouncer
---

<TopBlock>

PgBouncer holds a connection pool to the database and proxies incoming client connections by sitting between Prisma Client and the database. This reduces the number of processes a database has to handle at any given time. PgBouncer passes on a limited number of connections to the database and queues additional connections for delivery when space becomes available.

## Add <inlinecode>pgbouncer</inlinecode> to the connection URL

To use Prisma Client with PgBouncer from a serverless function, add the `?pgbouncer=true` flag to the PostgreSQL connection URL:

```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?pgbouncer=true
```

> Note: `PORT` specified for PgBouncer pooling sometimes different from the default `5432` port. Check database provider docs for the exact port number, otherwise adding `?pgbouncer=true` won't work.

## Set PgBouncer to transaction mode

Additionally, for Prisma Client to work reliably, PgBouncer must run in [**Transaction mode**](https://www.pgbouncer.org/features.html).

_Transaction mode_ offers a connection for every transaction – a requirement for the Prisma query engine to work with PgBouncer.

  <summary>How `pgbouncer` mode works in Prisma</summary>

- Prisma cleans up already present prepared statements in the connection by running `DEALLOCATE ALL` before preparing and executing Prisma Client queries.
- Prisma opens a transaction for every query case – even when just reading data, allowing Prisma to use prepared statements.

## Prisma Migrate and PgBouncer workaround

Prisma Migrate uses **database transactions** to check out the current state of the database and the migrations table. However, the Schema Engine is designed to use a **single connection to the database**, and does not support connection pooling with PgBouncer. If you attempt to run Prisma Migrate commands in any environment that uses PgBouncer for connection pooling, you might see the following error:

```bash
Error: undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement "s0" already exists
```

To work around this issue, you must connect directly to the database rather than going through PgBouncer. To achieve this, you can use the [`directUrl`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#fields) field in your [`datasource`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) <span class="api"></span> block.

For example, consider the following `datasource` block:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = "postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?pgbouncer=true"
  directUrl = "postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
}
```

The block above uses a PgBouncer connection string as the primary URL using `url`, allowing Prisma Client to take advantage of the PgBouncer connection pooler.

It also provides a connection string directly to the database, without PgBouncer, using the `directUrl` field. This connection string will be used when [commands that require a single connection](/data-platform/classic-projects/data-proxy/prisma-cli-with-data-proxy#prisma-cli-commands-that-require-a-direct-database-connection) to the database, such as `prisma migrate dev` or `prisma db push`, are invoked.

## PgBouncer with different database providers

There are sometimes minor differences in how to connect directly to a Postgres database that depend on the provider hosting the database.

Below are links to information on how to set up these connections with providers who have setup steps not covered here in our documentation:
