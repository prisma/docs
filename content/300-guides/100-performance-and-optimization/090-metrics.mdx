Prisma metrics give you a detailed insight into how Prisma Client interacts with your database. You can use this insight to help diagnose performance issues with your application.

## About metrics

Metrics provide information on the following aspects of Prisma Client:

- Number of operations <!!! what do we mean by an "operation"?>
- Query response times
- Active transactions <!!!do we mean info on the number of transactions over time?!!!>
- Connection pool information

You can export metrics in JSON or Prometheus formats and integrate them into an external metrics system or view them in a console log.

We provide the following metrics:

- Counters (always increase):
  - `query_total_queries`: The total number of database queries executed (!!! since when? - you initiate metrics?).
  - `query_total_operations`: The total number of operations executed. This can be less than `query_total_queries`, because some operations create multiple queries.
- Gauges (can increase or decrease):
  - `pool_active_connections`: The number of active connections in use. (!!!currently, or over time?)
  - `pool_idle_connections`: The number of connections that are not being used.
  - `pool_wait_count`: The number of workers waiting for a connection.
  - `query_active_transactions`: The number of active transactions.
- Histograms (bucketed distributions of values): (!!!what do we mean by bucketed distributions)?
  - `pool_wait_duration_ms`: The wait time for a worker to get a connection.
  - `query_total_elapsed_time_ms`: The execution time for all database queries executed.
  - `query_operation_total_elapsed_time_ms`: The execution time for all operations.

## Return metrics in JSON format

To get metrics in JSON format, add the following lines to your application code:

```ts
let metrics = await prisma.$metrics.json()
console.log(metrics)
```

This returns metrics in the following format:

```json
{
  "counters": [
    {
      "key": "query_total_operations",
      "labels": {},
      "value": 0,
      "description": "The total number of operations executed"
    },
    {
      "key": "query_total_queries",
      "labels": {},
      "value": 0,
      "description": "The total number of queries executed"
    }
  ],
  "gauges": [
    {
      "key": "pool_active_connections",
      "labels": {},
      "value": 0,
      "description": "The number of active connections in use"
    },
    {
      "key": "pool_idle_connections",
      "labels": {},
      "value": 21,
      "description": "The number of connections that are not being used"
    },
    {
      "key": "pool_wait_count",
      "labels": {},
      "value": 0,
      "description": "The number of workers waiting for a connection"
    },
    {
      "key": "query_active_transactions",
      "labels": {},
      "value": 0,
      "description": "The number of active transactions"
    }
  ],
  "histograms": [
    {
      "key": "pool_wait_duration_ms",
      "labels": {},
      "value": {
        "buckets": [
          [0, 0],
          [1, 0],
          [5, 0],
          [10, 0],
          [50, 0],
          [100, 0],
          [500, 0],
          [1000, 0],
          [5000, 0],
          [50000, 0]
        ],
        "sum": 0,
        "count": 0
      },
      "description": "The wait time for a worker to get a connection."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Use Prisma metrics with Statsd

You can send JSON-formatted metrics to StatsD. Note that we use Gauges for Counter and Gauge metrics from Prisma. This is because the Prisma Counter Metrics show the actual value and not the incremented or decremented value from a previous retrieval of the metrics.

In the following example, we send metrics to StatsD every 10 seconds. This is aligned with the default 10s flush rate of StatsD.

!!!code needed

## Return metrics in Prometheus format

When you get Prisma metrics in Prometheus format, you can use them by themselves, or combine them with the existing Prometheus metric system.

### Get metrics in Prometheus format.

To get Metrics in a Prometheus format, add the following lines to your application code:

```ts
let metrics = prisma.$metrics.prometheus()
console.log(metrics)
```

This returns metrics as follows:

```c
# HELP query_total_operations The total number of operations executed

# TYPE query_total_operations counter

query_total_operations 0

# HELP query_total_queries The total number of queries executed

# TYPE query_total_queries counter

query_total_queries 0

# HELP pool_active_connections The number of active connections in use

# TYPE pool_active_connections gauge

pool_active_connections 0

# HELP pool_idle_connections The number of connections that are not being used

# TYPE pool_idle_connections gauge

pool_idle_connections 21

# HELP pool_wait_count The number of workers waiting for a connection

# TYPE pool_wait_count gauge

pool_wait_count

# HELP query_active_transactions The number of active transactions

# TYPE query_active_transactions gauge

query_active_transactions

# HELP pool_wait_duration_ms The wait time for a worker to get a connection.

# TYPE pool_wait_duration_ms histogram

pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="0"} 0
pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="1"} 1
pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="5"} 1
pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="10"} 1
pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="50"} 1
pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="100"} 1
pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="500"} 1
pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="1000"} 1
pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="5000"} 1
pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="50000"} 1
pool_wait_duration_ms_bucket{le="+Inf"} 1
pool_wait_duration_ms_sum 0.050875000000000004
pool_wait_duration_ms_count 1
```

### Use Prisma metrics with the Prometheus metric system

In the majority of cases, Prometheus must scrape an endpoint to get metrics.

Example with `Express.js`:

```javascript
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";

const app = express();
const port = 4000;
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

app.get("/metrics", async (\_req, res: Response) => {
let metrics = await prisma.$metrics.prometheus();
res.end(metrics);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
})

Combining it with another Prometheus client library:
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";
import prom from "prom-client";

let registry = new prom.Registry();
const app = express();
const port = 4000;
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

app.get("/metrics", async (\_req, res: Response) => {
let prismaMetrics = await prisma.$metrics.prometheus();
let appMetrics = await registry.metrics();
res.end(prismaMetrics + appMetrics);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Global labels

You can add labels that apply to all Prisma metrics, for either JSON or Prometheus formats (!!!is this for JSON and Prometheus?). !!!why? what's the benefit of this? Also might want to mention this at top, and link to this section

For example:

```ts
let metrics = prisma.metrics.json({ global: 'label', app: 'one' })
console.log(metrics)
```

The above code returns information in the following format:

```json
{
  "counters": [
    {
      "key": "query_total_operations",
      "labels": { "global": "label", "app": "one" },
      "value": 0,
      "description": "The total number of operations executed"
    },
    {
      "key": "query_total_queries",
      "labels": { "global": "label", "app": "one" },
      "value": 0,
      "description": "The total number of queries executed"
    }
  ],
  "gauges": [
    {
      "key": "pool_active_connections",
      "labels": { "global": "label", "app": "one" },
      "value": 0,
      "description": "The number of active connections in use"
    },
    {
      "key": "pool_idle_connections",
      "labels": { "global": "label", "app": "one" },
      "value": 21,
      "description": "The number of connections that are not being used"
    },
    {
      "key": "pool_wait_count",
      "labels": { "global": "label", "app": "one" },
      "value": 0,
      "description": "The number of workers waiting for a connection"
    },
    {
      "key": "query_active_transactions",
      "labels": { "global": "label", "app": "one" },
      "value": 0,
      "description": "The number of active transactions"
    }
  ],
  "histograms": [
    {
      "key": "pool_wait_duration_ms",
      "labels": { "global": "label", "app": "one" },
      "value": {
        "buckets": [
          [0, 0],
          [1, 0],
          [5, 0],
          [10, 0],
          [50, 0],
          [100, 0],
          [500, 0],
          [1000, 0],
          [5000, 0],
          [50000, 0]
        ],
        "sum": 0,
        "count": 0
      },
      "description": "The wait time for a worker to get a connection."
    }
  ]
}
```
