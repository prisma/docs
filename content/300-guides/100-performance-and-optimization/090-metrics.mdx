Prisma metrics give you a detailed insight into how Prisma Client interacts with your database. You can use this insight to help diagnose performance issues with your application.

You can export metrics in JSON or Prometheus formats and view them in a console log, or integrate them into an external metrics system, such as StatsD or Prometheus.
