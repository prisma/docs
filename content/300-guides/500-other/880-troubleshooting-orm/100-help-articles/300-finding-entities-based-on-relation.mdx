## Problem

Common use cases when querying for relations from a database are:

- finding all the entities for table X where the relation Y doesn't exist
- finding all the entities for table X where the relation Y has at least one item

Taking a concrete example of users and posts as entities, this would translate to _"find the users that haven't created any posts"_ and _"find the users that have created at least one post"_.

Read below to learn how this can be achieved with Prisma.

## Solution

Consider this Prisma schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id     Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  user   User? @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int?
}
```

You can now query for the **users that do not have any posts** as follows:

```js
await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: { posts: { none: {} } },
})
```

This query returns all the users that haven't created any posts yet.

In a similar way, you can query for **users that created at least one post** as follows:

```js
await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: { posts: { some: {} } },
})
```

This query returns all the users that created at least one post.

This article showed how you can query for entities based on if the relation exists.
