This guide introduces Prisma's type system and explains how to introspect existing native types in your database, and how to use types when you apply schema changes to your database with Prisma Migrate or `db push`.

## How does Prisma's type system work?

Prisma uses _types_ to define the kind of data that a field can hold. To make it easy to get started, Prisma provides a small number of core [scalar types](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#model-field-scalar-types) that should cover most default use cases. For example, take the following blog post model:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id
  title     String
  createdAt DateTime
}
```

The `title` field of the `Post` model uses the `String` scalar type, while the `createdAt` field uses the `DateTime` scalar type.

Databases also have their own type system, which defines the type of value that a column can hold. Most databases provide a large number of data types to allow fine-grained control over exactly what a column can store. For example, a database might provide inbuilt support for multiple sizes of integers, or for XML data. The names of these types vary between databases. For example, in PostgreSQL the column type for booleans is `boolean`, whereas in MySQL the `tinyint(1)` type is typically used.

In the blog post example above, we are using the PostgreSQL connector. This is specified in the `datasource` block of the Prisma schema.

### Default type mappings

To allow you to get started with our core scalar types, Prisma provides _default type mappings_ that map each scalar type to a default type in the underlying database. For example:

- by default Prisma's `String` type gets mapped to PostgreSQL's `text` type and MySQL's `varchar` type
- by default Prisma's `DateTime` type gets mapped to PostgreSQL's `timestamp(3)` type and SQL Server's `datetime2` type

See Prisma's [database connector pages](/concepts/database-connectors) for the default type mappings for a given database. For example, [this table](/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql#prisma-migrate) gives the default type mappings for PostgreSQL.  
To see the default type mappings for all databases for a specific given Prisma type, see the [model field scalar types section](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#model-field-scalar-types) of the Prisma schema reference. For example, [this table](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#float) gives the default type mappings for the `Float` scalar type.

### Native type mappings

Sometimes you may need to use a more specific database type that is not one of the default type mappings for your Prisma type. For this purpose, Prisma provides [native type attributes](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#native-types-mapping) to refine the core scalar types. For example, in the `createdAt` field of your `Post` model above you may want to use a date-only column in your underlying PostgreSQL database, by using the `date` type instead of the default type mapping of `timestamp(3)`. To do this, add a `@db.Date` native type attribute to the `createdAt` field:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Post {
  id        Int      @id
  title     String
  createdAt DateTime @db.Date
}
```

Native type mappings allow you to express all the types in your database. However, you do not need to use them if the Prisma defaults satisfy your needs. This leads to a shorter, more readable Prisma schema for common use cases.

## How to introspect database types

When you [introspect](/concepts/components/introspection) an existing database, Prisma will take the database type of each table column and represent it in your Prisma schema using the correct Prisma type for the corresponding model field. If the database type is not the default database type for that Prisma scalar type, Prisma will also add a native type attribute.

As an example, take a `User` table in a PostgreSQL database, with:

- an `id` column with a data type of `serial`
- a `name` column with a data type of `text`
- an `isActive` column with a data type of `boolean`

You can create this with the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."User" (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name text NOT NULL,
  "isActive" boolean NOT NULL
);
```

Introspect your database with the following command run from the root directory of your project:

```terminal
npx prisma db pull
```

You will get the following Prisma schema:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model User {
  id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name     String
  isActive Boolean
}
```

The `id`, `name` and `isActive` columns in the database are mapped respectively to the `Int`, `String` and `Boolean` Prisma types. The database types are the _default_ database types for these Prisma types, so Prisma does not add any native type attributes.

Now add a `createdAt` column to your database with a data type of `date` by running the following SQL command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "public"."User"
ADD COLUMN "createdAt" date NOT NULL;
```

Introspect your database again:

```terminal
npx prisma db pull
```

Your Prisma schema now includes the new `createdAt` field with a Prisma type of `DateTime`. The `createdAt` field also has a `@db.Date` native type attribute, because PostgreSQL's `date` is not the default type for the `DateTime` type:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=5;add
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  isActive  Boolean
  createdAt DateTime @db.Date
}
```

## How to use types when you apply schema changes to your database

When you apply schema changes to your database using Prisma Migrate or `db push`, Prisma will use both the Prisma scalar type of each field and any native attribute it has to determine the correct database type for the corresponding column in the database.

As an example, create a Prisma schema with the following `Post` model:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Post {
  id        Int      @id
  title     String
  createdAt DateTime
  updatedAt DateTime @db.Date
}
```

This `Post` model has:

- an `id` field with a Prisma type of `Int`
- a `title` field with a Prisma type of `String`
- a `createdAt` field with a Prisma type of `DateTime`
- an `updatedAt` field with a Prisma type of `DateTime` and a `@db.Date` native type attribute

Now apply these changes to an empty PostgreSQL database with the following command, run from the root directory of your project:

```terminal
npx prisma db push
```

You will see that the database has a newly created `Post` table, with:

- an `id` column with a database type of `integer`
- a `title` column with a database type of `text`
- a `createdAt` column with a database type of `timestamp(3)`
- an `updatedAt` column with a database type of `date`

Notice that the `@db.Date` native type attribute modifies the database type of the `updatedAt` column to `date`, rather than the default of `timestamp(3)`.

## More on using Prisma's type system

For further reference information on using Prisma's type system, see the following resources:

- The [database connector](/concepts/database-connectors) page for each database provider has a type mapping section with a table of default type mappings between Prisma types and database types, and a table of database types with their corresponding native type attribute in Prisma. For example, the type mapping section for PostgreSQL is [here](/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql#type-mapping-between-postgresql-to-prisma-schema).
- The [model field scalar types](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#model-field-scalar-types) section of the Prisma schema reference has a subsection for each Prisma scalar type. This includes a table of default mappings for that Prisma type in each database, and a table for each database listing the corresponding database types and their native type attributes in Prisma. For example, the entry for the `String` Prisma type is [here](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#string).
