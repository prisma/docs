## Viewing and editing data in Prisma Studio

With Prisma Postgres, a hosted version of [Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio) is available for you in of your project. In your project environment in the [Platform Console](https://console.prisma.io/), select the **Studio** tab in the left-hand navigation to view and edit your data:

You can also run Prisma Studio locally by running:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

## Connecting to Prisma Postgres instance with third party database editors.

You can connect to your Prisma Postgres instance using third party database editors like pgAdmin, TablePlus, Postico etc using [`@prisma/ppg-tunnel` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/ppg-tunnel).

1. In your terminal export the env variable `DATABASE_URL` referring to your Prisma Postgres instance which you want to connect to.

    <TabbedContent code>

    <TabItem value="MacOS">
    ```terminal
    export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
    ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="Linux">
    ```terminal
    export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
    ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="Windows">

    ```cmd
    set DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
    ```
    </TabItem>

    </TabbedContent>

Run the following command to connect to your Prisma Postgres instance via `@prisma/ppg-tunnel` package:

```terminal
npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel
```

You should see output similar to:

```terminal
Prisma Postgres auth proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:52604 ðŸš€

Your connection is authenticated using your Prisma Postgres API key.
...

==============================
hostname:  127.0.0.1
port:      52604
username:  <anything>
password:  <none>
==============================
```

Please note that the port you will see in your output will be a randomly assigned port which may be different from the one mentioned here. We will use this port to connect to your Prisma Postgres instance using third party database editors.

:::note
Keep this tunnel process running while you are using the database editor to maintain the connection.
:::

Based on the database editor you are using, you can connect to your Prisma Postgres instance using the details you obtained from the output of the `@prisma/ppg-tunnel` package:

### TablePlus

1. Open TablePlus and click on the `+` icon to add a new connection.
2. Select `PostgreSQL` as the database type.
3. Enter the following details:

- Name: Any name you want to give to your connection.
- Host: `127.0.0.1` in this case. 
- Port: The port number you obtained from the output of the `@prisma/ppg-tunnel` package.
- User: You can provide any username here.
- Password: Leave it empty as the connection is authenticated using the tunnel.

4. Click on `Connect` to connect to your Prisma Postgres instance.
