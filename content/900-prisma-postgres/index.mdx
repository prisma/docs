[Prisma Postgres速](https://www.prisma.io/postgres?utm_source=docs) is a managed PostgreSQL database service that easily lets you create a new database, interact with it through Prisma ORM, and build applications that start small and cheap but can scale to millions of users.

It supports the following workflows:

- Schema migrations and queries (via [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm))
- Connection pooling and caching (via [Prisma Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/accelerate))
- Real-time database change events (via [Prisma Pulse](https://www.prisma.io/pulse))

## Bundling with Prisma Accelerate and Pulse

During the Early Access period, Prisma Postgres comes bundled with [Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate) and [Prisma Pulse](/pulse). 

### Using the Client extension for Prisma Accelerate (required)

Because all traffic to Prisma Postgres is routed through Accelerate's connection pool, your project must have the [`@prisma/extension-accelerate`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-accelerate) npm package installed. The extension then needs to be applied to the `PrismaClient` instance you use to interact with your database:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
  .$extends(withAccelerate())
```

### Using the Client extension for Prisma Pulse (optional)

Pulse is able to deliver real-time events from your Prisma Postgres database to your application via Prisma Client. If you want to make use of this functionality, you'll need to install the [`@prisma/extension-pulse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-pulse) npm library in your project and apply the extension to your `PrismaClient` instance:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
  .$extends(withAccelerate())
  .$extends(withPulse())
```

## Technical details

Here's an overview of the technical details of your Prisma Postgres instances:

- **PostgreSQL version**: 17
- **Storage**: Max 1GB

## Architecture

Prisma Postgres uses a unique architecture to deliver unmatched efficiency, safety and ease of use. It is deployed on bare metal servers using unikernels (think: "hyper-specialized operating systems").

Learn more about the architecture in our [announcement article](https://pris.ly/ppg-early-access?utm_source=docs).
