Prisma PostgresÂ® can be accessed securely via a TCP tunnel using the [`@prisma/ppg-tunnel` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/ppg-tunnel), an authentication proxy designed for local development. This package establishes a secure connection to Prisma Postgres through a local TCP server, enabling secure access from local tools while automatically handling traffic routing and authentication.

:::note

This is an [Early Access](/platform/maturity-levels#early-access) feature of Prisma Postgres. It is not recommended for production use and is not intended for application connections.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js installed
- [Prisma Postgres](/prisma-postgres) database connection string.

### Exporting environment variables

The tunnel expects you to have the following environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL` - The connection string for your Prisma Postgres database

To export the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable temporarily in a terminal session:

<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="MacOS">
```terminal
export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Linux">
```terminal
export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows">

```cmd
set DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
```
</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

### Starting the TCP tunnel

To start the proxy server, run the following command:

```sh
npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel
```

This will start the tunnel on a randomly assigned TCP port. The proxy automatically handles authentication, so any database credentials are accepted. The tunnel also encrypts traffic, meaning clients should be set to not require SSL.

### Customizing host and port

By default, the tunnel listens on `127.0.0.1` and assigns a random port. Since it provides access to your Prisma Postgres database, it should only be exposed within a trusted network. You can specify a custom host and port using the `--host` and `--port` flags:

```sh
npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5432
```

## Next steps

The local tunnel enables you to access Prisma Postgres from 3rd party database editors such as Postico, TablePlus and pgAdmin. Learn more in this [section](/prisma-postgres/database-editors#2-connect-to-prisma-postgres-using-tableplus).

## Security considerations

- The tunnel should not be exposed to untrusted networks.
- Always store API keys securely and avoid hardcoding them.
- Ensure that only necessary users have direct access to the Prisma Postgres database.
