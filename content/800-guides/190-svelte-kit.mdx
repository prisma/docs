## Introduction

Prisma ORM streamlines database access with type-safe queries, and when paired with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit), it creates a robust and scalable full-stack architecture.

In this guide, you'll learn to integrate Prisma ORM with a Prisma Postgres database in a SvelteKit project from scratch. You can find a complete example of this guide on [GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/orm/svelte-kit).

---

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org)
- [Svelte VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) (Recommended by Svelte)

---

## 1. Set up your project

You'll be using [Svelte CLI](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli) instead of `npx create svelte@latest`. This CLI provides a more interactive setup and built-in support for popular tooling like ESLint and Prettier

Create a new Svelte project:

```terminal
npx sv create sveltekit-prisma
```

It will prompt you to customize your setup. Here are the options you'll choose:

:::info

- *Which template would you like?* `SvelteKit minimal`
- *Add type checking with TypeScript?* `Yes, using TypeScript syntax`
- *What would you like to add to your project?* `prettier, eslint`
- *Which package manager do you want to install dependencies with?* `npm`

:::


Once the setup completes, navigate into your project and start the development server:

```terminal
cd sveltekit-prisma
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it! Svelte makes it a very simple process to get up and running. At this point, your project is ready to integrate Prisma and connect to a Prisma Postgres database.

---

## 2. Install and Configure Prisma

### 2.1. Install Dependencies

To get started with Prisma, you'll need to install a few dependencies:

```terminal
npm install prisma --save-dev
npm install tsx --save-dev
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

:::info
If you're not using a Prisma Postgres database, you can skip `@prisma/extension-accelerate`.
:::

Once installed, initialize Prisma in your project:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db --output ../src/generated/prisma
```
:::info
You'll need to answer a few questions while setting up your Prisma Postgres database. Select the region closest to your location and a memorable name for your database like "My SvelteKit Project"
:::
This will create:

- A `prisma/` directory with a `schema.prisma` file
- A `.env` file with a `DATABASE_URL` already set

### 2.2. Define your Prisma Schema

In the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, add the following models and change the generator to use the `prisma-client` provider:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma showLineNumbers
generator client {
	//add-next-line
  provider = "prisma-client"
  //delete-next-line
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "../generated/prisma"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

//add-start
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  authorId  Int
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
//add-end
```

This creates two models: `User` and `Post`, with a one-to-many relationship between them.

### 2.3. Configure the Prisma Client Generator

Now, run the following command to create the database tables and generate the Prisma Client:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```
### 2.4. Seed the Database

Let's add some seed data to populate the database with sample users and posts.

Create a new file called `seed.ts` in the `prisma/` directory:

```typescript file=prisma/seed.ts showLineNumbers
import { PrismaClient, Prisma } from "../src/generated/prisma";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const userData: Prisma.UserCreateInput[] = [
  {
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@prisma.io",
    posts: {
      create: [
        {
          title: "Join the Prisma Discord",
          content: "https://pris.ly/discord",
          published: true,
        },
        {
          title: "Prisma on YouTube",
          content: "https://pris.ly/youtube",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  {
    name: "Bob",
    email: "bob@prisma.io",
    posts: {
      create: [
        {
          title: "Follow Prisma on Twitter",
          content: "https://www.twitter.com/prisma",
          published: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
];

export async function main() {
  for (const u of userData) {
    await prisma.user.create({ data: u });
  }
}

main();
```

Now, tell Prisma how to run this script by updating your `package.json`:

```json file=package.json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
}
```

Run the seed script:

```terminal
npx prisma db seed
```

And open Prisma Studio to inspect your data:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

---

## 3. Integrate Prisma into SvelteKit

### 3.1. Create a Prisma Client

Inside your `/src/lib` directory, rename index.ts to prisma.ts. This file will be used to create and export your Prisma Client instance.

:::tip
Files in `src/lib` can be accessed from anywhere using the `$lib` alias.
:::

Set up the Prisma client like this:

```typescript file=src/lib/prisma.ts showLineNumbers
import { PrismaClient } from "../generated/prisma";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

export default prisma;
```

:::info
If you're not using Prisma Postgres, remove `.$extends(withAccelerate())`.
:::

### 3.2. Create a Server Route

To fetch data from the database on the server side, create a `+page.server.ts` file in your routes directory. This file should export a `load` function, which runs on the server before your page renders.

Start with a basic `load` function:

```typescript file=src/routes/+page.server.ts showLineNumbers
//add-start
export async function load() {}
//add-end
``` 

Use the `findMany()` method to get a list of users with their basic fields.

Update your `+page.server.ts` file like this:

```typescript file=src/routes/+page.server.ts showLineNumbers
//add-next-line
import prisma from '$lib/prisma';

export async function load() {
//add-start
	const users = await prisma.user.findMany({});
	return {
		users
	};
//add-end
}

```

At this point, you're only getting data directly on the User model — no relations like posts are included yet.

To also fetch each user's posts, we can expand the query using the `include` option. This tells Prisma to join the related `Posts` table in the result.

Update your `findMany()` call like this:

```typescript file=src/routes/+page.server.ts showLineNumbers
import prisma from '$lib/prisma';

export async function load() {
	const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
	//add-start
		include: {
			posts: true
		}
	//add-end
	});

	return {
		users
	};
}
```  

Now, every user in the result will also include a `posts` array.

### 3.3. Populate the Page

In `src/routes/+page.svelte`, strip the file down to the basics and add a `<script>` fragment:

```html file=src/routes/+page.svelte showLineNumbers
//add-start
<script lang="ts">
</script>
//add-end

//add-next-line
<h1>SvelteKit + Prisma</h1>
//delete-start
<h1>Welcome to SvelteKit</h1>
<p>Visit <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit">svelte.dev/docs/kit</a> to read the documentation</p>
//delete-end
```

We need to grab the data exported from `+page.server.ts`:

```html file=src/routes/+page.svelte showLineNumbers
<script lang="ts">
//add-next-line
	let { data } = $props();
</script>

<h1>SvelteKit + Prisma</h1>
```

Now that we have the data, let's map through the users and their posts with Svelte's [`each`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/each) block:

```html file=src/routes/+page.svelte showLineNumbers
<script lang="ts">
	let { data } = $props();
</script>

<h1>SvelteKit + Prisma</h1>

//add-start
{#each data.users as user}
  <h2>{user.name}</h2>
  {#each user.posts as post}
    <ul>
      <li><a href={post.content}>{post.title}</a></li>
    </ul>
  {/each}
{/each}
//add-end
```

You're done! You've just created a SvelteKit app with Prisma ORM. Below are some next steps to explore, as well as some more resources to help you get started expanding your project.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working SvelteKit app connected to a Prisma Postgres database, you can:

- Extend your Prisma schema with more models and relationships
- Add create/update/delete routes and forms
- Explore authentication and validation
