## Introduction

This guide shows you how to use Prisma ORM with Next.js 15, a fullstack React framework. You'll learn how to set up Prisma ORM with Next.js, handle migrations, and deploy your application to Vercel. You can find a [deployment-ready example on GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/orm/nextjs).

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) database (or any PostgreSQL database)
- A Vercel account (if you want to deploy your application)

## 1. Set up a Next.js project

From the directory where you want to create your project, run `create-next-app` to create a new Next.js app that we will be using for this guide.

```terminal
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

You will be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Select all of the defaults.

:::info

For completeness, those are:

- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Tailwind CSS
- No `src` directory
- App Router
- Turbopack
- No customized import alias

:::

Then, navigate to the project directory:

```terminal
cd my-app
```

## 2. Setup your databases and Prisma instances

Initialize Prisma ORM  with an instance of [Prisma Postgres](/postgres) in the `database` package by running the following command: 

```terminal
pnpm prisma init --db
```

Enter a name for your project and choose a database region.

:::info

We're going to be using [Prisma Postgres](/postgres/getting-started) in this guide. If you're not using a Prisma Postgres database, you won't need to add the `--db` flag.

:::

This command:

- Connects your CLI to your [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io) account. If you're not logged in or don't have an account, your browser will open to guide you through creating a new account or signing into your existing one.
- Creates a `prisma` directory containing a `schema.prisma` file for your database models.
- Creates a `.env` file with your `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., for Prisma Postgres it should have something similar to `DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI..."`).


Edit the `schema.prisma` file to define a `User` model in your database and specify a [custom `output` directory](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client#using-a-custom-output-path) to generate the Prisma Client. This ensures that generated types are resolved correctly:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  //add-start
  output = "../generated/user-database-client"
  //add-end
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

//add-start
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}
//add-end
```
