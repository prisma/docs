## Introduction

This guide shows you how to migrate your application from Sequelize to Prisma ORM. We'll use an extended version of the [Sequelize Express example](https://github.com/sequelize/express-example) as a [sample project](https://github.com/prisma/migrate-from-sequelize-to-prisma) to demonstrate the migration steps.

This migration guide uses PostgreSQL as the example database, but it equally applies to any other relational database that's [supported by Prisma ORM](/orm/reference/supported-databases). You can learn how Prisma ORM compares to Sequelize on the [Prisma ORM vs Sequelize](/orm/more/comparisons/prisma-and-sequelize) page.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, make sure you have:

- A Sequelize project you want to migrate
- Node.js installed (version 18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL or another supported database
- Basic familiarity with Sequelize and Express.js

## 1. Prepare for migration

### 1.1. Understand the migration process

The steps for migrating from Sequelize to Prisma ORM are always the same, no matter what kind of application or API layer you're building:

1. Install the Prisma CLI
2. Introspect your database
3. Create a baseline migration
4. Install Prisma Client
5. Gradually replace your Sequelize queries with Prisma Client

These steps apply whether you're building a REST API (e.g., with Express, Koa, or NestJS), a GraphQL API (e.g., with Apollo Server, TypeGraphQL, or Nexus), or any other kind of application that uses Sequelize for database access.

### 1.2. Set up Prisma configuration

Create a new Prisma schema file:

```terminal
npx prisma init
```

This command created a new directory called `prisma` with the following files for you:

- `schema.prisma`: Your Prisma schema that specifies your database connection and models
- `.env`: A [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to configure your database connection URL as an environment variable

The Prisma schema currently looks as follows:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma showLineNumbers
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

:::tip

If you're using VS Code, be sure to install the [Prisma VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) for syntax highlighting, formatting, auto-completion and a lot more cool features.

:::

Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file with your database connection string:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
```

## 2. Migrate the database schema

### 2.1. Introspect your database

Run Prisma's introspection to create the Prisma schema from your existing database:

```terminal
npx prisma db pull
```

This will create a `schema.prisma` file with your database schema.

### 2.2. Create a baseline migration

To continue using Prisma Migrate to evolve your database schema, you will need to [baseline your database](/orm/prisma-migrate/getting-started).

First, create a `migrations` directory and add a directory inside with your preferred name for the migration. In this example, we will use `0_init` as the migration name:

```terminal
mkdir -p prisma/migrations/0_init
```

Next, generate the migration file with `prisma migrate diff`. Use the following arguments:

- `--from-empty`: assumes the data model you're migrating from is empty
- `--to-schema-datamodel`: the current database state using the URL in the `datasource` block
- `--script`: output a SQL script

```terminal wrap
npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma --script > prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 0_init
```

The command will mark `0_init` as applied by adding it to the `_prisma_migrations` table.

You now have a baseline for your current database schema. To make further changes to your database schema, you can update your Prisma schema and use `prisma migrate dev` to apply the changes to your database.

## 3. Update your application code

### 3.1. Install Prisma Client

As a next step, you can install Prisma Client in your project so that you can start replacing the database queries in your project that are currently made with Sequelize:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/client
```

After installing Prisma Client, you can generate the Prisma Client code:

```terminal
npx prisma generate
```

### 3.2. Replace Sequelize queries

In this section, we'll show a few sample queries that are being migrated from Sequelize to Prisma Client based on the example routes from the sample REST API project. For a comprehensive overview of how the Prisma Client API differs from Sequelize, check out the [API comparison](/orm/more/comparisons/prisma-and-sequelize#api-comparison) page.

<TabItem value="Sequelize">

```typescript
// Find one
const user = await User.findOne({ 
  where: { id: 1 } 
});

// Create
const user = await User.create({
  email: 'alice@prisma.io',
  name: 'Alice'
});

// Update
await User.update({ name: 'New name' }, { 
  where: { id: 1 } 
});

// Delete
await User.destroy({
  where: { id: 1 }
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Prisma Client">

```typescript
// Find one
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ 
  where: { id: 1 } 
});

// Create
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    name: 'Alice'
  }
});

// Update
await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: 1 },
  data: { name: 'New name' }
});

// Delete
await prisma.user.delete({
  where: { id: 1 }
});
```

</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

### 3.3. Update your controllers

Update your Express controllers to use Prisma Client. For example, here's how to update a user controller:

```typescript
import { prisma } from '../client'

export class UserController {
  async create(req: Request, res: Response) {
    const { email, name } = req.body
    
    const result = await prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        email,
        name,
      },
    })
    
    return res.json(result)
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Now that you've migrated to Prisma ORM, you can:

- Add more complex queries using Prisma's powerful query API
- Set up Prisma Studio for database management
- Implement database monitoring
- Add automated tests using Prisma's testing utilities
