## Introduction

This guide shows you how to write guides for Prisma ORM documentation. It covers the required structure, formatting, and style conventions to ensure consistency across all guides. You'll learn about frontmatter requirements, section organization, and writing style.

## Prerequisites

Before writing a guide, make sure you have:

- A clear understanding of the topic you're writing about
- Access to the Prisma documentation repository
- Familiarity with Markdown and MDX
- Knowledge of the target audience for your guide

## Guide structure

### Required frontmatter

Every guide must include the following frontmatter at the top of the file:

```mdx
---
title: 'How to [do something] with Prisma ORM'
metaTitle: 'How to [do something] with Prisma ORM'
description: 'Learn how to [do something] with Prisma ORM'
sidebar_label: '[Concise Label]'
image: '/img/guides/[guide-name]-cover.png'
---
```

- `title`: Should be action-oriented and start with "How to"
- `metaTitle`: Usually matches the title, used for SEO
- `description`: A one-sentence summary starting with "Learn how to", used for SEO
- `sidebar_label`: A concise label for the sidebar navigation
- `image`: A unique header image for social media sharing (coordinate with the design team)

All frontmatter fields should be in sentence case, except for `image`.

### Required sections

1. **Introduction**
   - Brief overview of what the guide covers
   - What the reader will learn/accomplish
   - Link to any example repositories or related resources

2. **Prerequisites**
   - Required software/tools with version numbers
   - Required knowledge/experience
   - Any necessary accounts or access

3. **Main content sections**
   - Numbered steps for procedural guides (e.g., "1. Set up the project")
   - Clear hierarchy with H2 (`##`) for main sections
   - H3 (`###`) for subsections
   - Each step should build on previous steps

4. **Next steps**
   - What to do after completing the guide
   - Related guides or documentation
   - Links to additional resources
   - Community resources (e.g., Discord)

## Writing style and voice

### General principles

- Write in a clear, conversational tone
- Use active voice and present tense
- Address the reader directly using "you"
- Use first person plural ("we") when guiding the reader through steps
- Avoid jargon and explain technical terms
- Be concise but thorough

### Code examples

- Include complete, runnable code examples
- Use syntax highlighting with language specification
- Include file paths in code block metadata
- Use comments to explain complex parts
- Show both the problem and solution when applicable

Example:

```typescript file=src/index.ts
// Import required dependencies
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

// Initialize Prisma Client
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

### Formatting conventions

- Use backticks for:
  - File names: \`schema.prisma\`
  - Directory names: \`prisma/\`
  - Code elements: \`PrismaClient\`
  - Commands: \`npx prisma generate\`
- Use [admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) for important notes, warnings, tips, etc.:
  ```mdx
  :::note
  Important information goes here
  :::
  ```
- Use proper heading hierarchy (never skip levels)
- Include line numbers in longer code blocks
- Use tabbed content for alternative approaches

## Examples from existing guides

### Migration guide format

Migration guides follow a specific pattern, as seen in guides like [Migrate from Sequelize](/guides/migrate-from-sequelize) and [Migrate from Mongoose](/guides/migrate-from-mongoose):

1. Clear introduction explaining the migration path
2. Prerequisites specific to both ORMs
3. Step-by-step migration process
4. Code comparison between ORMs
5. Practical examples of common operations

### Integration guide format

Integration guides, like [Using Prisma ORM with Cloudflare D1](/guides/cloudflare-d1), focus on:

1. Setup and configuration
2. Platform-specific considerations
3. Step-by-step implementation
4. Deployment instructions
5. Platform-specific best practices

## Best practices

1. **Keep it focused**
   - Each guide should cover one main topic
   - Break complex topics into multiple guides
   - Link to related guides instead of duplicating content

2. **Show don't tell**
   - Include practical, real-world examples
   - Provide complete, working code samples
   - Explain why certain approaches are recommended

3. **Consider the context**
   - Explain prerequisites clearly
   - Don't assume prior knowledge
   - Link to foundational concepts within or outside of our docs when needed

4. **Maintain consistency**
   - Follow the established guide structure
   - Use consistent terminology
   - Match the style of existing guides

5. **Think about maintenance**
   - Use version numbers where appropriate
   - Avoid time-sensitive references
   - Consider future updates when structuring content

## Next steps

After reading this guide, you can:

- Start writing your own guide using the provided structure
- Review existing guides for reference
- Request a unique header image for your guide
- Submit your guide for review

## Template
This aims to standardize our guides to be consistent and quicker. The goal is to copy this into a new .mdx file and fill in the blanks with the framework-specific information.

:::

## Introduction

---

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org)

---

## 1. Set up your project

---

## 2. Install and Configure Prisma

### 2.1 Install Dependencies

To get started with Prisma, you'll need to install a few dependencies:

```terminal
npm install prisma --save-dev
npm install tsx --save-dev
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

:::info
If you're not using a Prisma Postgres database, you can skip `@prisma/extension-accelerate`.
:::

Once installed, initialize Prisma in your project:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db
```

This will create:

- A `prisma/` directory with a `schema.prisma` file
- A `.env` file with a `DATABASE_URL` already set

### 2.2 Define your Prisma Schema

Open the `prisma/schema.prisma` file and add the following models:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  authorId  Int
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
```

This creates two models: `User` and `Post`, with a one-to-many relationship between them.

Now, run the following command to create the database tables and generate the Prisma Client:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### Step 2.3: Seed the Database

Let's add some seed data to populate the database with sample users and posts.

Create a new file called `seed.ts` in the `prisma/` directory:

```typescript file=prisma/seed.ts
import { PrismaClient, Prisma } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const userData: Prisma.UserCreateInput[] = [
  {
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@prisma.io",
    posts: {
      create: [
        {
          title: "Join the Prisma Discord",
          content: "https://pris.ly/discord",
          published: true,
        },
        {
          title: "Prisma on YouTube",
          content: "https://pris.ly/youtube",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  {
    name: "Bob",
    email: "bob@prisma.io",
    posts: {
      create: [
        {
          title: "Follow Prisma on Twitter",
          content: "https://www.twitter.com/prisma",
          published: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
];

export async function main() {
  for (const u of userData) {
    await prisma.user.create({ data: u });
  }
}

main();
```

Now, tell Prisma how to run this script by updating your `package.json`:

```json file=package.json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
}
```

Run the seed script:

```terminal
npx prisma db seed
```

And open Prisma Studio to inspect your data:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

---

## 3. Integrate Prisma into __________

### Step 3.1: Create a Prisma Client

At the root of your project, create a new `lib` folder and a `prisma.ts` file inside it:

```terminal
mkdir -p lib && touch lib/prisma.ts
```

Add the following code to create a Prisma Client instance:

```typescript file=lib/prisma.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

export default prisma;
```

:::info
If you're not using Prisma Postgres, remove `.$extends(withAccelerate())`.
:::

---

## 4. Deployment // IF DEPLOYING

---

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working __________ app connected to a Prisma Postgres database, you can:

- Extend your Prisma schema with more models and relationships
- Add create/update/delete routes and forms
- Explore authentication, validation, and optimistic updates
