## Introduction

This guide shows you how to use Prisma ORM with Cloudflare D1, a serverless SQL database that runs on Cloudflare's edge network. You'll learn how to set up Prisma ORM with D1, handle migrations, and deploy your application to Cloudflare Workers. You can find a [deployment-ready example on GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/blob/latest/deployment-platforms/edge/cloudflare-workers/with-d1).

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, make sure you have:

- A Cloudflare account
- Node.js installed (version 18 or higher)
- Wrangler CLI installed (version 3.39.0 or higher)
- Basic familiarity with Cloudflare Workers and D1

## 1. Configure Prisma schema

In your Prisma schema, add the `driverAdapters` Preview feature to the `generator` block and set the `provider` of the `datasource` to `sqlite`. If you just bootstrapped the Prisma schema with `prisma init`, also be sure to add the following `User` model to it:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}
```

## 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-d1
```

Also, be sure to use a version of the Wrangler CLI that's above [`wrangler@^3.39.0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/releases/tag/wrangler%403.39.0), otherwise the `--remote` flag that's used in the next sections won't be available.

## 3. Set up D1 database connection

To connect your Workers with the D1 instance, add the following binding to your `wrangler.toml`:

```toml file=wrangler.toml
name = "prisma-cloudflare-worker-example"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-03-20"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.DB
database_name = "__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__" # to be replaced
database_id = "__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID__"     # to be replaced
```

Note that `__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__` and `__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID__` in the snippet above are placeholders that should be replaced with the database name and ID of your own D1 instance.

If you weren't able to grab this ID from the terminal output, you can also find it in the Cloudflare Dashboard or by running `npx wrangler d1 list` and `npx wrangler d1 info __YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__` in your terminal.

## 4. Set up database migrations

:::note

We recommend using `prisma migrate` in order to keep your data in D1 migrated. However, if you would prefer to use Cloudflare's migration system, [that workflow is also available](/orm/overview/databases/cloudflare-d1#using-the-wrangler-cli)

:::

### 4.1 Add needed environment variables

In order to use the Prisma D1 adapter, you'll need to add a few secrets to a `.env` file:
- `DATABASE_URL`: A path to your local D1 instance. Usually `"file:./prisma/db.sqlite"`.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID, fetched via `npx wrangler whoami`
- `CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID`: The ID of your database, retrieved [during D1 database creation](#3-set-up-d1-database-connection).
- `CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN`: This API token is used by Prisma ORM to communicate with your D1 instance directly. To create this, follow these steps:
  1. Visit https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
  2. Click "Create Token"
  3. Click "Custom token" template
  4. Fill out the template: Make sure you use a recognizable name and add the `Account / D1 / Edit` permission.
  5. Click "Continue to summary" and then "Create Token".

You can now store these secrets to be used by Prisma ORM. We recommend a `.env` file for local development, but any secret store will work.

```bash file=.env
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/db.sqlite"

CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="0773..."
CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID="01f30366-..."
CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN="F8Cg..."
```

### 4.2 Configure Prisma Config

Ensure that you have a `prisma.config.ts` file set up in the root of your project with a [migration driver adapter](/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference#migrateadapter) defined.

```ts
import path from 'node:path'
import type { PrismaConfig } from 'prisma'
import { PrismaD1HTTP } from '@prisma/adapter-d1'

// import your .env file
import 'dotenv/config'

type Env = {
  CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN: string
  CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: string
  CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID: string
}

export default {
  earlyAccess: true,
  schema: path.join('prisma', 'schema.prisma'),
  migrate: {
    async adapter(env) {
      return new PrismaD1HTTP({
        CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN: env.CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN,
        CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID,
        CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID: env.CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID,
      })
    },
  },
} satisfies PrismaConfig<Env>
```

This will allow `prisma migrate` to interact with your D1 database. 

### 4.3 Run your first migration

You can now run `prisma migrate dev` to migrate your database to match your local schema:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Let's also create some dummy data that we can query once the Worker is running. This time, we'll use wrangler to run a SQL statement without storing it in a file:

```terminal
# For the local database
npx wrangler d1 execute __YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__ --command "INSERT INTO  \"User\" (\"email\", \"name\") VALUES
('jane@prisma.io', 'Jane Doe (Local)');" --local

# For the remote database
npx wrangler d1 execute __YOUR_D1_DATABASE_NAME__ --command "INSERT INTO  \"User\" (\"email\", \"name\") VALUES
('jane@prisma.io', 'Jane Doe (Remote)');" --remote
```

## 5. Implement the Worker

Before adding a Prisma Client query to your Worker, you need to generate Prisma Client with the following command:

```
npx prisma generate
```

In order to query your database from the Worker using Prisma ORM, you need to:

1. Add the `DB` binding to the `Env` interface. (Alternatively, you can run [`npx wrangler types`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#types) to generate the `Env` type from the binding in a separate file called `worker-configuration.d.ts`.)
2. Instantiate `PrismaClient` using the `PrismaD1` driver adapter.
3. Send a query using Prisma Client and return the result.

Open `src/index.ts` and replace the entire content with the following:

```typescript file=src/index.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { PrismaD1 } from '@prisma/adapter-d1'

export interface Env {
  DB: D1Database
}

export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<Response> {
    const adapter = new PrismaD1(env.DB)
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

    const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
    const result = JSON.stringify(users)
    return new Response(result)
  },
}
```

## 6. Run the Worker locally

With the database query in place and Prisma Client generated, you can go ahead and run the Worker locally:

```
npm run dev
```

Now you can open your browser at [`http://localhost:8787`](http://localhost:8787/) to see the result of the database query:

```js no-copy
;[{ id: 1, email: 'jane@prisma.io', name: 'Jane Doe (Local)' }]
```

## 7. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and deploy the Worker

To deploy the Worker, run the the following command:

```
npm run deploy
```

Your deployed Worker is accessible via `https://prisma-d1-example.USERNAME.workers.dev`. If you navigate your browser to that URL, you should see the following data that's queried from your remote D1 database:

```js no-copy
;[{ id: 1, email: 'jane@prisma.io', name: 'Jane Doe (Remote)' }]
```

## Next steps

Now that you've set up Prisma ORM with Cloudflare D1, you can:

- Add more complex queries using Prisma's powerful query API
