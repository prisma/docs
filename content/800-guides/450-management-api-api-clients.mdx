## Postman

Postman is a popular API client with testing, collaboration, and automation features for working with REST APIs.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A [Prisma Console account](https://console.prisma.io)
- [Postman installed](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

### 1. Create an OAuth2 Application

First, you'll need to register an OAuth2 application in Prisma Console:

1. Navigate to [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) and log in
2. Click the **🧩 Integrations** tab in the left sidebar
3. Under the "Published Applications" section, click **New Application**
4. Fill in your application details:
   - **Name**: Postman API Client
   - **Description**: Brief description of your application *(Optional)*
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback`
5. Click **Continue**
6. **Important**: Copy your Client ID and Client Secret immediately and store them securely

:::note
The redirect URI `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback` is Postman's default callback URL when using the "Authorize using browser" option.
:::

### 2. Configure OAuth 2.0 in Postman

Now you'll set up authentication in Postman:

1. Open Postman and create a new HTTP request
2. Set the request method to **POST**
3. Set the URL to `https://api.prisma.io/v1/projects`
4. Navigate to the **Authorization** tab
5. Set **Auth Type** to **OAuth 2.0**
6. Under **Configure New Token**, enter the following values:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Token Name | Management API Token |
| Grant Type | Authorization Code |
| Callback URL | `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback` |
| Authorize in Browser | `true` *(checked)* |
| Auth URL | `https://auth.prisma.io/authorize` |
| Access Token URL | `https://auth.prisma.io/token` |
| Client ID | `your-client-id` |
| Client Secret | `your-client-secret` |
| Scope | `workspace:admin` |

7. Click **Get New Access Token**
8. A browser window will open and have you complete the authorization flow
9. Return to Postman and click **Use Token** to attach it to your request
10. Verify that your new token appears under **Current Token** at the top of the Authorization tab

### 3. Make your first request

With authentication configured, you can now create a project:

1. In the request body, select **raw** and **JSON** format
2. Add the following JSON payload:
```json
{
  "name": "My Postman Database",
  "region": "us-east-1"
}
```

3. Click **Send**

You should receive a successful response confirming your project creation.
