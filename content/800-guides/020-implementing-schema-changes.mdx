## Introduction

When working in a team, managing database schema changes can be challenging. This guide shows you how to effectively collaborate on schema changes using Prisma Migrate, ensuring that all team members can safely contribute to and incorporate schema changes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, make sure you have:

- Node.js installed (version 18 or higher)
- A Prisma project set up with migrations
- A relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, etc.)
- Basic understanding of Git
- Basic familiarity with Prisma Migrate

:::warning

This guide **does not apply for MongoDB**.<br />
Instead of `migrate dev`, [`db push`](/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/prototyping-your-schema) is used for [MongoDB](/orm/overview/databases/mongodb).

:::

## 1. Understand migration basics

### 1.1. Migration order

Migrations are **applied in the same order as they were created**. The creation date is part of the migration subfolder name - for example, `20210316081837-updated-fields` was created on `2021-03-16-08:18:37`.

### 1.2. Source control requirements

You should commit the following files to source control:

- The contents of the `.prisma/migrations` folder, including the `migration_lock.toml` file
- The Prisma Schema (`schema.prisma`)

Source-controlling the `schema.prisma` file is not enough - you must include your migration history because:

- Customized migrations contain information that cannot be represented in the Prisma schema
- The `prisma migrate deploy` command only runs migration files

## 2. Incorporate team changes

### 2.1. Pull latest changes

To incorporate changes from collaborators:

1. Pull the changed Prisma schema and `./prisma/migrations` folder
2. Run the migrate command:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 2.2. Example scenario

Let's walk through a sample scenario with three developers sharing schema changes:

<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="Before">

```prisma file=schema.prisma 
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="After">

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

model User {
  id              Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email           String  @unique
  name            String?
  //add-start
  favoriteColor   String? // Added by Ania
  bestPacmanScore Int? // Added by you
  //add-end
  posts           Post[]
}

//add-start
// Added by Javier
model Tag {
  tagName     String   @id
  tagCategory Category
}
//add-end
```

</TabItem>
</TabbedContent>

## 3. Handle concurrent changes

### 3.1. Developer A's changes

Ania adds a new field:

```prisma
model User {
  /* ... */
  favoriteColor String?
}
```

And generates a migration:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name new-field
```

### 3.2. Developer B's changes

Javier adds a new model:

```prisma
model Tag {
  tagName     String   @id
  tagCategory Category
}
```

And generates a migration:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name new-model
```

### 3.3. Merge changes

The migration history now has two new migrations:

![A diagram showing changes by two separate developers converging in a single migration history.](/img/guides/migrate-team-dev.png)

## 4. Integrate your changes

### 4.1. Pull team changes

1. Pull the most recent changes:
   - Two new migrations
   - Updated schema file

2. Review the merged schema:

```prisma
model User {
  /* ... */
  favoriteColor   String?
  bestPacmanScore Int?
}

model Tag {
  tagName     String   @id
  tagCategory Category
  posts       Post[]
}
```

### 4.2. Generate your migration

Run the migrate command:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This will:
1. Apply your team's migrations
2. Create a new migration for your changes
3. Apply your new migration

### 4.3. Commit changes

Commit:
- The merged `schema.prisma`
- Your new migration file
