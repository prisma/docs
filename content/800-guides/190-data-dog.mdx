## Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up Datadog tracing for a new Prisma project. By combining the `@prisma/instrumentation` package with Prisma Client extensions, you'll capture detailed spans for every database query. These spans are then sent to Datadog using dd-trace, enabling you to monitor and analyze your application's database activity.

### What are spans and tracing?

- **Spans** are the individual operations or units of work within a distributed system or complex application. Each database query, service call, or external request is represented by a span.
  
- **Tracing** ties these spans together to form a complete, end-to-end picture of a request’s lifecycle. With tracing, you can visualize bottlenecks, identify problematic queries, and pinpoint where errors occur from your queries.

### Why use Datadog?

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a robust monitoring and analytics platform that provides application performance monitoring, logs management, metrics collection, and more. By sending your trace data to Datadog, you gain real-time visibility into how your application interacts with its databases and external services, all in one convenient, centralized platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** installed (v18+ recommended).
- A local or hosted **PostgreSQL** database.
- A **Datadog** account. If you do not have one, [sign up here](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
- The **Datadog Agent** installed and running on your machine or server where this application will run. You can follow the [Datadog Agent installation docs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) to set it up.

## 1. Create a new project

To get started, create a new folder and initialize a fresh `package.json`:

```terminal
mkdir prisma-datadog-tracing
cd prisma-datadog-tracing
npm init -y
```

## 2. Set up Prisma ORM

In this section, you will install Prisma, create your schema, and generate the Prisma Client. This prepares your application to run database queries—queries that you will trace with Datadog.

### 2.1. Install Prisma ORM and create your first models

Run the following commands to install Prisma and a minimal TypeScript runner:

```terminal
npm install -D prisma tsx
```

Next, initialize Prisma and create a Prisma Postgres database instance. Use the `--db` flag to create a [new Prisma Postgres](/postgres) project:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db --output ../src/generated/prisma
```

:::note
You will be prompted to name your database and select the closest region. For clarity, choose a memorable name (e.g., `My Datadog Project`).

If you're not using Prisma Postgres, you donot need to add the `--db` flag. However, in that case, you need to add the connection url to your own database in the `.env` file.

:::

This command does the following:

1. Creates a `prisma` directory with a `schema.prisma` file.  
2. Creates a `.env` file at the project root with your database connection string (`DATABASE_URL`).  
3. Generates the Prisma Client in the `/src/generated/prisma` directory (as specified in the `--output` flag).

Now, open `prisma/schema.prisma` and update your generator block and models. Replace the `generator` block with the following, and add a `User` and a `Post` model:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output = "../src/generated/prisma"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

//add-start
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  authorId  Int
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
//add-end
```

### 2.2. Generate the Prisma Client and run migrations

Generate the Prisma Client and apply your schema to your database:

```terminal
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name "init"
```

This creates the tables according to your schema in the Postgres database and generates a client for you to interact with the database.

## 3. Install required dependencies for tracing

In addition to Prisma, you will need the following packages for Datadog tracing:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/instrumentation \
  dd-trace \
  @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

:::note

If you're not using Prisma Postgres, you donot need to install the `@prisma/extension-accelerate` extension.

:::

Also ensure you have development dependencies for TypeScript:

```terminal
npm install -D typescript
```

Here’s a quick overview:

- **`@prisma/instrumentation`**: Instruments Prisma queries so they appear as spans in your tracer.
- **`dd-trace`**: Official Node.js tracing library from Datadog.

## 4. Set up Datadog tracing

Create a `tracer.ts` file in the `src` folder to instantiate your tracing logic:

```terminal
touch src/tracer.ts
```

### 4.1. Configure the tracer

Open `src/tracer.ts` and add the following code:

```ts file=src/tracer.ts
import Tracer from "dd-trace";
import {
  PrismaInstrumentation,
  registerInstrumentations,
} from "@prisma/instrumentation";

const tracer = Tracer.init({
  apmTracingEnabled: true,
  service: "prisma-datadog-tracing",
  version: "1.0.0",
  profiling: true
});

const provider = new tracer.TracerProvider();

// Register the provider globally
provider.register();

registerInstrumentations({
  instrumentations: [
    new PrismaInstrumentation({
      enabled: true,
    }),
  ],
  tracerProvider: provider,
});

export { tracer };
```

:::note 

If you recieve a linting error in the line `traceprovider:provider` due to types being incompatible you have to add the following line to the `package.json`:

```json
//add-start
"overrides": {
  "@opentelemetry/api": "1.8.0"
}
//add-end
```

Then re-install the dependencies:

```terminal
npm i
```

Then the linting error should be gone.

:::

#### Explanation

- **`Tracer.init`** configures `dd-trace` with a `service` name. This name appears in Datadog under your `APM` > `Services` list.
- **`@prisma/instrumentation`** automatically logs each Prisma query as a Datadog span.
- The `middleware: true` option ensures that each query is intercepted for instrumentation.

## 5. Instantiate Prisma and run queries

### 5.1. Create the Prisma Client instance

Create a `src/client.ts` to hold your Prisma Client instantiation:

```ts file=src/client.ts
import { tracer } from "./tracer";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma";

const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [{ emit: "event", level: "query" }],
})
  .$on("query", (e) => {
    const span = tracer.startSpan(`prisma_raw_query`, {
      childOf: tracer.scope().active() || undefined,
      tags: {
        "prisma.rawquery": e.query,
      },
    });
    span.finish();
  })
  .$extends({
    query: {
      async $allOperations({ operation, model, args, query }) {
        const span = tracer.startSpan(
          `prisma_query_${model?.toLowerCase()}_${operation}`,
          {
            tags: {
              "prisma.operation": operation,
              "prisma.model": model,
              "prisma.args": JSON.stringify(args),
              "prisma.rawQuery": query,
            },
            childOf: tracer.scope().active() || undefined,
          }
        );

        try {
          const result = await query(args);
          span.finish();
          return result;
        } catch (error) {
          span.setTag("error", error);
          span.finish();
          throw error;
        }
      },
    },
  })
  .$extends(withAccelerate());

export { prisma };
```

:::note

If you’re not using Prisma Postgres just remove the `.$extends(withAccelerate())` line from the code.

:::

The setup above gives you more control over how queries are traced:

- Tracing is initialized as early as possible by importing the `tracer` before creating the Prisma Client.
- The `$on("query")` hook captures raw SQL queries and sends them as standalone spans.
- The `$allOperations` extension wraps all Prisma operations in custom spans, allowing you to tag them with metadata like the model, operation type, and arguments.

Unlike the `@prisma/instrumentation` package, which offers automatic tracing out of the box, this manual setup gives you full control over how each span is structured and tagged. It's helpful when you need custom span names, additional metadata, a simpler setup, or when working around limitations or compatibility issues in the OpenTelemetry ecosystem. It also allows you to adapt tracing behavior based on query context, which can be especially useful in complex applications.



### 5.2. Add a script that performs queries

Create a `src/index.ts` file and add code to perform queries to your database and send traces to Datadog:

```typescript file=src/index.ts
import { prisma } from "./client";

async function main() {
  // Create unique emails
  const user1Email = `alice${Date.now()}@prisma.io`;
  const user2Email = `bob${Date.now()}@prisma.io`;

  // Create both users concurrently with their posts
  const [alice, bob] = await Promise.all([
    prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        email: user1Email,
        name: "Alice",
        posts: {
          create: {
            title: "Join the Prisma community on Discord",
            content: "https://pris.ly/discord",
            published: true,
          },
        },
      },
      include: { posts: true },
    }),
    prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        email: user2Email,
        name: "Bob",
        posts: {
          create: [
            {
              title: "Check out Prisma on YouTube",
              content: "https://pris.ly/youtube",
              published: true,
            },
            {
              title: "Follow Prisma on Twitter",
              content: "https://twitter.com/prisma/",
              published: false,
            },
          ],
        },
      },
      include: { posts: true },
    }),
  ]);

  console.log(
    `Created users: ${alice.name} (${alice.posts.length} post) and ${bob.name} (${bob.posts.length} posts)`
  );

  // Retrieve all published posts
  const publishedPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
    where: { published: true },
  });

  // Create an unpublished post for Alice then publish it
  let post = await prisma.post.create({
    data: {
      title: "Join the Prisma Discord community",
      content: "https://pris.ly/discord",
      published: false,
      author: { connect: { email: user1Email } },
    },
  });
  post = await prisma.post.update({
    where: { id: post.id },
    data: { published: true },
  });
  console.log("Newly published post:", post);

  // Retrieve all posts by Alice
  const alicePosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
    where: { author: { email: user1Email } },
  });
  console.log("Alice's posts:", alicePosts);
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
```

## 6. Run your queries and see the traces

Run the queries:

```terminal
npx tsx src/index.ts
```

This executes your script, which:

- Registers the Datadog tracer.
- Performs multiple Prisma queries.
- Logs the result of each operation.

Then, confirm the traces in Datadog:

- Open your [Datadog APM page](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/).
- Navigate to **APM > Traces > Explorer** in the side panel.
- Explore the list of traces and spans, each representing a Prisma query (e.g. `prisma:query`).

:::info
Depending on your Datadog setup, it may take a minute or two for new data to appear. Refresh or wait briefly if you do not see traces right away.

## Next steps

You have successfully:

- Created a Prisma ORM project with [Prisma Postgres](/postgres).
- Set up Datadog tracing using `@prisma/instrumentation` and `dd-trace`.
- Verified that database operations show up as spans in Datadog.

To improve your observability further:

- Add more instrumentation for your HTTP server or other services (e.g., Express, Fastify).
- [Create Dashboards to view](https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/) key metrics from your data.
