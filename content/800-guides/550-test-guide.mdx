# Testing CodeRabbit Integration

This guide helps test CodeRabbit's review capabilities with specific test cases.

## Test Case 1: Code Snippet Handling

This section contains code snippets that should not be modified:

```typescript
// This is a test code block that should not trigger any review comments
const testFunction = () => {
  console.log("This should be ignored by the reviewer");
};
```

## Test Case 2: Single Review Enforcement

This PR should only generate one review comment from CodeRabbit, even if there are multiple potential issues.

## Test Case 3: No Art or Poetry

This section intentionally avoids any creative writing, art, or poetry to test the no-art rule.

## Test Case 4: Scope Limitation

Only the following line should be considered for review:

```typescript
const needsReview = true; // This line is intentionally problematic
```

## Test Case 5: Duplicate Resolution

This issue was previously fixed and should not be suggested again:

```typescript
const alreadyFixed = "This was fixed in a previous PR";
```

## Test Case 6: Performance Considerations

This section tests the performance of the review system with a larger block of code:

```typescript
// This is a performance test block
const testPerformance = () => {
  const items = Array(1000).fill(0).map((_, i) => i);
  return items.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
};
```

## Conclusion

This guide is specifically designed to test CodeRabbit's review capabilities according to the specified requirements.

> **Note**: This is a test document for CI/CD pipeline validation.
