The [Prisma Nuxt module](/orm/more/help-and-troubleshooting/prisma-nuxt-module) helps you get started with Prisma in [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) applications by simplifying the initial setup process. This guide explains how to set up a Nuxt application, configure [Prisma Postgres](https://prisma.io/postgres) using the Prisma Nuxt module, and deploy the project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for production.

### What you'll learn:

- How to set up a Nuxt project with the Prisma Nuxt module.
- How to configure and use Prisma Postgres with the Prisma Nuxt module in your Nuxt app.
- How to deploy the project to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, ensure you have the following:  

- Node.js version: A [compatible Node.js version](/orm/guides/upgrade-guides/upgrading-to-prisma-6#minimum-supported-nodejs-versions), such as `v20.11.0`, required for Prisma 6.  
- Accounts:  
  - [GitHub](https://github.com)  
  - [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io)  
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com)  
- Basic knowledge of Git and Vercel deployment (helpful but not required).  

### Guide created using:

- Nuxt version: `0.2.0`  
- Prisma ORM version: `6.1.0`  
- npm version: `10.2.4`  
- Node.js version: `v20.11.0`  
- Operating system: `macOS`  


## 1. Create a New Nuxt Project and set up the Prisma Nuxt module

1. Initialize [a new Nuxt project](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation#new-project) and select `npm` as the package manager and initialize git:
    ```terminal
    npx nuxi@latest init hello-world
    ```
    :::note
    We recommend using `npm` as it is the most stable option with the `@prisma/nuxt` module.
    :::

2. Navigate into the project directory and install the `@prisma/nuxt` module:
    ```terminal
    npm i @prisma/nuxt
    ```

3. Add the `@prisma/nuxt` module and the following configuration to the `nuxt.config.ts` file:
    ```typescript
    // https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      compatibilityDate: "2024-11-01",
      modules: ["@prisma/nuxt"],
      experimental: {
        componentIslands: true,
      },
      devtools: { enabled: true },
    });
    ```

## 2. Setup Prisma ORM by running the development server locally

After configuring your Nuxt project with the Prisma module, the next step is to set up Prisma ORM. This process begins by starting the development server, which automatically configures Prisma with a [SQLite database](/orm/overview/databases/sqlite).

Run the following command to start the development server:

```terminal
npm run dev
```

When the server starts, Prisma will be set up automatically:

1. [Prisma CLI](/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference) is installed.
2. A Prisma project is initialized with SQLite as the default database.
3. Example `User` and `Post` models are created in the `schema.prisma` file:
prisma:
    ```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
    // This is your Prisma schema file,
    // learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    datasource db {
      provider = "sqlite"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    model User {
      id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
      email String  @unique
      name  String?
      posts Post[]
    }

    model Post {
      id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
      title     String
      content   String?
      published Boolean @default(false)
      author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
      authorId  Int
    }
    ```
4. Prompt you to run a migration to create database tables with [Prisma Migrate](/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/overview).
    :::note
      The database migrates automatically the first time you start the module if there isn't a `migrations` folder. After that, you need to run `npx prisma migrate dev` manually in the CLI to apply any schema changes. Running the `npx prisma migrate dev` command manually makes it easier and safer to manage migrations and also to [troubleshoot](/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/troubleshooting) any migration-related errors.
    :::
5. Install and generate a [Prisma Client](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference) which enables you to query your DB.
6. Start [Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio)  

When the Prisma setup is complete, the development server should start on `https://localhost:3000`. Terminate the server. As we will make some code changes.

## 4. Update the application code

With Prisma configured, the next step is to update your application code to fetch and display data from your database.

1. In the root directory of your project, create a folder named `components`.

2. Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `User.server.vue`. This server component will fetch and display the name of the first user from the database:  
   ```html file=components/User.server.vue
   <script setup>
   const prisma = usePrismaClient();
   const user = await prisma.user.findFirst();
   </script>

   <template>
     <p>{{ user?.name ?? "No user has been added yet." }}</p>
   </template>
   ```

3. Modify the `app.vue` file in the root directory to include the new server component using Nuxt Islands:  
   ```html file=app.vue
   <template>
     <div>
       <NuxtIsland name="User"></NuxtIsland>
     </div>
   </template>
   ```

4. Run the following command to start the development server again:  
   ```terminal
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Verify the application code is working by opening your application in a browser at `https://localhost:3000`.  
   As there are no users in the database yet, the application will display:  
   ```terminal
   No user has been added yet.
   ```
   This message will dynamically update when users are added to your database.

By completing these steps, your application is now capable of fetching data from your Prisma database and rendering it on the frontend.

## 5. Create a Prisma Postgres instance

Now create a Prisma Postgres database instance using the Prisma Data Platform:

1. Navigate to [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io).
2. Click **New Project** to create a new project.
3. Enter a name for your project in the **Name** field.
4. Inside the **Prisma Postgres®** section, click **Get Started**.
5. Choose a region close to your location from the **Region** dropdown.
6. Click **Create Project** to set up your database. This redirects you to the database setup page.
7. In the **Set up database access** section, copy the `DATABASE_URL`. You will use this in the next steps.

At this point, you have successfully created a Prisma Postgres instance.

## 6. Set up Prisma Postgres in your Nuxt app

Now that the Prisma Postgres instance is ready, update your Nuxt application to use this database:

1. Update the `.env` file by replacing the existing `DATABASE_URL` value with the one you previously copied:
    ```bash file=.env
    + DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=PRISMA_POSTGRES_API_KEY"
    - DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
    ```

2. Modify the `schema.prisma` file by changing the database provider in the `datasource` block of the `schema.prisma` file located in the `prisma` folder:
   ```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
   datasource db {
   +  provider = "postgresql"
   -  provider = "sqlite"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```
3. Delete the SQLite database files (`dev.db` and `dev.db-journal`) along with the `migrations` folder, all located in the `prisma` directory. This cleans up the existing SQLite setup and prepares your project to migrate to PostgreSQL.
4. Manually create a new migration for the Postgres database by running the `prisma migrate` command:
   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```
5. Start the development server again:
   ```terminal
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Add a user using Prisma Studio by opening it in the Nuxt DevTools and add a `name` and `email` for a new user.
   :::note
   When the server starts, the CLI will display a message explaining how to open Prisma Studio in the Nuxt DevTools:
    ```terminal
    After clicking Get Started in Nuxt DevTools, click on the three dots (︙) in the lower left-hand side to reveal additional tabs.
    Locate the Prisma logo to open Prisma Studio.
    ```
   ::: 
7. Verify the data in the application by refreshing your application at `https://localhost:3000`. The page should display the name of the user you added in Prisma Studio. For example, if you added a user named `Jon`, the application will display `Jon` in the browser.

Congratulations, your Nuxt app is now fully integrated with Prisma Postgres!

## 7. Deploy to Vercel

Deploy your Nuxt application with Prisma Postgres integration to Vercel by following these steps:

1. Ensure your project is version-controlled and pushed to a GitHub repository. If you don’t have a repository yet, [create one on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). Once the repository is ready, run the following commands:
   ```terminal
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with Prisma Postgres integration"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   :::note
    Replace `<your-username>` and `<repository-name>` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository.
   :::
2. Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and navigate to your [Dashboard](https://vercel.com/docs/dashboard-features).
3.  Create a new project. Follow Vercel's guide, but stop at the [step 3](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel/import#optionally-configure-any-settings) where you will configure environment variables before clicking **Deploy**.
4. Configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
   1. Expand the **Environment variables** section.
   2. Add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
     - **Key**: `DATABASE_URL`
     - **Value**: Paste your Prisma Postgres `DATABASE_URL`.
   :::warning
   Do not deploy without setting the `DATABASE_URL` variable. Your deployment will fail if the application cannot connect to the database.
   :::
5. Click the **Deploy** button. Vercel will build your project and deploy it to a live URL.
6. Open the live URL provided by Vercel and verify that your application is working:
   - If you’ve added a user in Prisma Studio, their name should appear on the live site.
   - If no users exist, the application will display:
     ```
     No user has been added yet.
     ```
7. To add or manage data:
   1. Open Prisma Studio via [the Prisma Data Platform](https://prisma.io/blog/studio-for-prisma-postgres-view-and-edit-your-data-online) or local instance.
   2. Add or update user data in the database.
   3. Refresh your live site to confirm the changes.

Congratulations! Your Nuxt application with Prisma Postgres integration is now live and fully operational on Vercel.

## Considerations

This guide helps you get started with Prisma Postgres using the Nuxt module. Because the Nuxt module is actively evolving, it does not cover all of Prisma’s features or support every edge case. For more advanced functionality or edge deployments, consider using Prisma directly.
