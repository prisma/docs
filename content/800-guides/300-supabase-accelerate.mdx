## Introduction

This guides teaches you how to add connection pooling to a PostgreSQL database hosted on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) using [Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate). 

Prisma Accelerate is a robust and mature connection pooler enabling your database to function properly during traffic spikes and high load scenarios. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnL75if6Aq0) demonstrating how it performs in a load test or [learn why connection pooling is important](https://www.prisma.io/blog/saving-black-friday-with-connection-pooling).

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this guide, you need **a connection string for a PostgreSQL instance hosted on Supabase**. It typically looks similar to this:

```bash no-copy
postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.nzpppscrldfwlzfalbrf.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

If you already have a project using Prisma ORM, you can skip the first two steps and jump ahead to [Step 3. Install the Accelerate extension](#3-install-the-accelerate-extension).

## 1. Set up Prisma ORM

Start by installing the Prisma CLI in your project:

```
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

Then, run the following command to initialize a new project:

```
npx prisma init
```

This will create a new `prisma` directory with a `schema.prisma` file and add a `.env` file with the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

Update the file and set the `DATABASE_URL` to your Supabase connection string:

```bash file=.env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.nzpppscrldfwlzfalbrf.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

Create a `prisma.config.ts` file to configure Prisma:

```typescript file=prisma.config.ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import { defineConfig, env } from 'prisma/config';

export default defineConfig({
  schema: 'prisma/schema.prisma',
  migrations: {
    path: 'prisma/migrations',
  },
  datasource: {
    url: env('DATABASE_URL'),
  },
});
```

:::note

You'll need to install the `dotenv` package to load environment variables:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

:::

## 2. Introspect your database

Next, run the following command to introspect your database and create your data model:

```terminal
npx prisma db pull
```

This command reads your database schema and creates new models in your `schema.prisma` file that match the tables in your database.

:::note

If you want to use Prisma Migrate in the future, you also need to [baseline your database](/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/baselining).

:::

## 3. Install the Accelerate extension

Install the Prisma Client extension for Accelerate:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

This is needed to access Prisma Accelerate's connection pool.

## 4. Set up Accelerate in the Prisma Console

To set up Accelerate in the Prisma Console, follow these steps:

1. Log into the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io).
1. Select **New project**
1. Choose a **Name** for your project
1. In the **Choose your starting product** section, find the **Accelerate** card and click **Get started**
1. In the field for your **Database connection string**, paste your Supabase connection string
1. Select the **Region** that's closest to your database
1. Click **Create project**
1. On the next screen, click **Enable Accelerate**

Once you went through these steps, you'll be redirected to another page where you need to the click the **Generate API key** button.

You'll then be shown a new connection URL which enables you to connect to Prisma Accelerate's connection pool. This needs to be set as the new `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file:

```bash file=.env
DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey..."
```

:::note

If you want to use Prisma Migrate with Prisma Accelerate, you need to provide a direct database URL in your `prisma.config.ts` file. The Accelerate URL (starting with `prisma://`) is used for queries via PrismaClient, while the direct database URL is used for migrations.

Update your `prisma.config.ts`:

```typescript file=prisma.config.ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import { defineConfig, env } from 'prisma/config';

export default defineConfig({
  schema: 'prisma/schema.prisma',
  migrations: {
    path: 'prisma/migrations',
  },
  datasource: {
    url: env('DIRECT_URL'), // Direct database URL for migrations
  },
});
```

And add the `DIRECT_URL` to your `.env` file:

```bash file=.env
DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey..."
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.nzpppscrldfwlzfalbrf.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

:::

## 5. Generate Prisma Client

With your Prisma schema in place, you can go ahead and generate Prisma Client:

```
npx prisma generate
```

:::info

In Prisma 7, the `--no-engine` flag is no longer required when using Prisma Accelerate. Previously, you would run `prisma generate --no-engine`, but now the standard `prisma generate` command works for all use cases.

:::

## 6. Send queries through the connection pool

In your application code, you now need to apply the Accelerate extension to your Prisma Client instance:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma/client"
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate"

const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  accelerateUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
}).$extends(withAccelerate())
```

At this point, you can now start sending queries which will be routed through the connection pool to your database.
