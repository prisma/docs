This guide explains how to set up a Nuxt application, configure [Prisma Postgres](https://prisma.io/postgres) with Prisma ORM, and deploy the project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for production.

Here's what you'll learn:

- How to set up a Nuxt project that uses Prisma ORM directly.
- How to configure and use Prisma Postgres with Prisma ORM in your Nuxt app.
- How to deploy the project to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, ensure you have the following:  

- Node.js version: A [compatible Node.js version](/orm/more/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-6#minimum-supported-nodejs-versions) required for Prisma 6.  
- Accounts:  
  - [GitHub](https://github.com)  
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com)  
- Basic knowledge of Git and Vercel deployment (helpful but not required).  

## 1. Create a New Nuxt Project and install Prisma dependencies

1. Initialize [a new Nuxt project](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation#new-project), select `npm` as the package manager and initialize git:
    ```terminal
    npm create nuxt hello-world
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory and install Prisma ORM dependencies along with the PostgreSQL driver adapter:
    ```terminal
    cd hello-world
    npm install prisma @prisma/client @prisma/adapter-pg pg dotenv tsx
    ```
3. Initialize Prisma with PostgreSQL by running:
    ```terminal
    npx prisma init --datasource-provider postgresql
    ```

## 2. Configure Prisma

Before running the development server, create a `prisma.config.ts` file in the root of your project to manage environment variables and configuration:

```typescript file=prisma.config.ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import { defineConfig, env } from 'prisma/config'

export default defineConfig({
  schema: 'prisma/schema.prisma',
  migrations: {
    path: 'prisma/migrations',
    seed: 'tsx ./prisma/seed.ts',
  },
  datasource: {
    url: env('DATABASE_URL'),
  },
})
```

## 3. Set up Prisma ORM

With Prisma initialized, define your data model and run a migration to create the PostgreSQL database.

1. Update the `prisma/schema.prisma` file with the following configuration:
    ```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
    // This is your Prisma schema file,
    // learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client"
      output   = "./generated"
    }

    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
    }

    model User {
      id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
      email String  @unique
      name  String?
      posts Post[]
    }

    model Post {
      id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
      title     String
      content   String?
      published Boolean @default(false)
      author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
      authorId  Int
    }
    ```
2. Create the initial migration and database tables:
    ```terminal
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```
3. Once the command succeeds, start the Nuxt development server:
    ```terminal
    npm run dev
    ```
4. When the server is running at `http://localhost:3000`, stop it for now—we’ll update some files before continuing.

## 4. Update the application code

With Prisma configured, the next step is to update your application code to fetch and display data from your database.

1. In the root directory of your project, create a folder named `lib` and add a `prisma.ts` file to share a single Prisma Client instance that connects through the PostgreSQL adapter:
    ```ts file=lib/prisma.ts
    import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'
    import { PrismaClient } from '../prisma/generated/client'

    const prismaClientSingleton = () => {
      const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL! })
      return new PrismaClient({ adapter })
    }

    type PrismaClientSingleton = ReturnType<typeof prismaClientSingleton>

    const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
      prisma: PrismaClientSingleton | undefined
    }

    export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? prismaClientSingleton()

    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma
    ```

2. Create a folder named `components` (if it doesn’t exist yet) and inside it add `User.server.vue`. This server component fetches and displays the name of the first user from the database:
   ```html file=components/User.server.vue
   <script setup>
      import prisma from '~/lib/prisma'
      const user = await prisma.user.findFirst()
   </script>

   <template>
     <p>{{ user?.name ?? "No user has been added yet." }}</p>
   </template>
   ```

3. Modify the `app.vue` file in the root directory to include the new server component using Nuxt Islands:  
   ```html file=app.vue
   <template>
     <div>
       <NuxtIsland name="User"></NuxtIsland>
     </div>
   </template>
   ```

4. Run the following command to start the development server again:  
   ```terminal
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Verify the application code is working by opening your application in a browser at `https://localhost:3000`.  
   As there are no users in the database yet, the application will display:  
   ```no-copy
   No user has been added yet.
   ```
   This message will dynamically update when users are added to your database.

By completing these steps, your application is now capable of fetching data from your Prisma database and rendering it on the frontend.

## 5. Seed your database (optional)

If you want sample data, create a `prisma/seed.ts` file. The following script uses the PostgreSQL adapter:

```ts file=prisma/seed.ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import { PrismaClient } from './generated/client'
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL! })
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

const userData = [
  {
    name: 'Alice',
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: [
        {
          title: 'Join the Prisma Discord',
          content: 'https://pris.ly/discord',
          published: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'Nilu',
    email: 'nilu@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: [
        {
          title: 'Follow Prisma on Twitter',
          content: 'https://www.twitter.com/prisma',
          published: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'Mahmoud',
    email: 'mahmoud@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: [
        {
          title: 'Ask a question about Prisma on GitHub',
          content: 'https://www.github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions',
          published: true,
        },
        {
          title: 'Prisma on YouTube',
          content: 'https://pris.ly/youtube',
        },
      ],
    },
  },
]

async function main() {
  console.log(`Start seeding ...`)
  for (const u of userData) {
    const user = await prisma.user.create({
      data: u,
    })
    console.log(`Created user with id: ${user.id}`)
  }
  console.log(`Seeding finished.`)
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Run the seed command whenever you need demo data:

```terminal
npx prisma db seed
```

## 6. Create a Prisma Postgres instance

To store your app's data, you'll create a Prisma Postgres database instance using the Prisma Data Platform.

Follow these steps to create your Prisma Postgres database:

1. Log in to [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) and open the Console.
1. In a [workspace](/platform/about#workspace) of your choice, click the **New project** button.
1. Type a name for your project in the **Name** field, e.g. **hello-ppg**.
1. In the **Prisma Postgres** section, click the **Get started** button.
1. In the **Region** dropdown, select the region that's closest to your current location, e.g. **US East (N. Virginia)**.
1. Click the **Create project** button.

At this point, you'll be redirected to the **Database** page where you will need to wait for a few seconds while the status of your database changes from **`PROVISIONING`** to **`CONNECTED`**.

Once the green **`CONNECTED`** label appears, your database is ready to use!

Then, find your database credentials in the **Set up database access** section, copy the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable`.

```bash no-copy
DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
```

The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable will be required in the next steps. 

## 7. Set up Prisma Postgres in your Nuxt app

Now that the Prisma Postgres instance is ready, update your Nuxt application to use this database:

1. Update the `.env` file by replacing the existing `DATABASE_URL` value with the one you previously copied. It will look similar to this:
    ```terminal file=.env
    // edit-next-line
    DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=PRISMA_POSTGRES_API_KEY"
    ```

2. Manually run a migration to sync your schema to Prisma Postgres:
   ```terminal
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```
3. (Optional) Seed your database with sample data:
   ```terminal
   npx prisma db seed
   ```
4. Start the development server again:
   ```terminal
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Verify the data in the application by opening `https://localhost:3000`. If you seeded the database, you should see the first user's name displayed.

Congratulations, your Nuxt app is now fully integrated with Prisma Postgres!

## 8. Deploy to Vercel

Deploy your Nuxt application with Prisma Postgres integration to Vercel by following these steps:

1. Ensure your project is version-controlled and pushed to a GitHub repository. If you don't have a repository yet, [create one on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). Once the repository is ready, run the following commands:
   ```terminal
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with Prisma Postgres integration"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   :::note
    Replace `<your-username>` and `<repository-name>` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository.
   :::
2. Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and navigate to your [Dashboard](https://vercel.com/docs/dashboard-features).
3.  Create a new project. Follow Vercel's [Import an existing project](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel/import) guide, but stop at [step 3](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel/import#optionally-configure-any-settings) where you will configure environment variables _before_ clicking **Deploy**.
4. Configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
   1. Expand the **Environment variables** section.
   2. Add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
        - **Key**: `DATABASE_URL`
        - **Value**: Paste your Prisma Postgres connection URL, e.g. by copying it from the `.env` file in your Nuxt project.
      :::warning
      Do not deploy without setting the `DATABASE_URL` variable. Your deployment will fail if the application cannot connect to the database.
      :::
5. Click the **Deploy** button. Vercel will build your project and deploy it to a live URL.
6. Open the live URL provided by Vercel and verify that your application is working:
   - If you've added a user in Prisma Studio, their name should appear on the live site.
   - If no users exist, the application will display:
     ```
     No user has been added yet.
     ```
7. To add or manage data:
   1. Open Prisma Studio via [the Prisma Data Platform](https://prisma.io/blog/studio-for-prisma-postgres-view-and-edit-your-data-online) or local instance.
   2. Add or update user data in the database.
   3. Refresh your live site to confirm the changes.

Congratulations! Your Nuxt application with Prisma Postgres integration is now live and fully operational on Vercel.
