## Problem

Lots of users have come across this warning while working with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) in development:

```
warn(prisma-client) Already 10 Prisma Clients are actively running
```

There's a related [discussion](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/4399) and [issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5103) for the same.

In development, the command `next dev` clears Node.js cache on run. This in turn initializes a new `PrismaClient` instance each time due to hot reloading that creates a connection to the database. This exhausts the database connections as each `PrismaClient` instance holds its own connection pool.

## Solution

The solution in this case is to instantiate a single instance `PrismaClient` and save it on the [`global`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global) object. Then we keep a check to only instantiate `PrismaClient` if it's not on the `global` object otherwise use the same instance again if already present to prevent instantiating extra `PrismaClient` instances.

```ts
// db.ts

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

let prisma: PrismaClient

// check to use this workaround only in development and not in production
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  prisma = new PrismaClient()
} else {
  if (!global.prisma) {
    global.prisma = new PrismaClient()
  }

  prisma = global.prisma
}

export default prisma
```

After creating this file, you can now import this `PrismaClient` instance anywhere in your Next.js `pages` as follows:

```ts
// e.g. in `pages/index.tsx`
import prisma from './db'

export const getServerSideProps = async ({ req }) => {
  const token = req.headers.AUTHORIZATION
  const userId = await getUserId(token)
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
    where: {
      author: { id: userId },
    },
  })
  return { props: { posts } }
}
```
