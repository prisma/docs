## Problem

Lots of users have queries about can one model many-to-many relations and query for the data using Prisma. Here are two examples one implicit and one explicit to show how you can handle these with Prisma.

## Solution

### Implicit relations

This is a type of many-to-many relation where Prisma handles the join table internally. A basic example for an implicity many-to-many relation would look like this:

```prisma
model Post {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title String
  tags  Tag[]
}

model Tag {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String @unique
  posts Post[]
}
```

To create a post and its tags, one can write this with Prisma:

```ts
await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'Types of relations',
    tags: { create: [{ name: 'dev' }, { name: 'prisma' }] },
  },
})
```

In the above example, we can directly query for posts along with their tags as follows:

```ts
await prisma.post.findMany({
  include: { tags: true },
})
```

And the response obtained would be:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Types of relations",
    "tags": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "dev"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "prisma"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Another use case for this is if you want to add new tags as well as connect to existing tags to a post. An example for this is where a user has created new tags for their post and has also selected existing tags to be added as well. In this case, we can perform this in the following way:

```ts
await prisma.post.update({
  where: { id: 1 },
  data: {
    title: 'Prisma is awesome!',
    tags: { set: [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }], create: { name: 'typescript' } },
  },
})
```

### Explicit relations

Explicit relations mostly need to be created in cases where you would need to store extra fields in the join table or if you're introspecting an existing database that already has many-to-many relations setup. This is the same schema used above but with an explicit join table:

```prisma
model Post {
  id    Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  title String
  tags  PostTags[]
}

model PostTags {
  id     Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  post   Post? @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  tag    Tag?  @relation(fields: [tagId], references: [id])
  postId Int?
  tagId  Int?
}

model Tag {
  id    Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String     @unique
  posts PostTags[]
}
```

Adding tags to a post would be a create into the join table (`PostTags`) as well as into the tags table (`Tag`):

```ts
await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'Types of relations',
    tags: {
      create: [{ tag: { create: { name: 'dev' } } }, { tag: { create: { name: 'prisma' } } }],
    },
  },
})
```

Also querying for posts along with their tags would require an extra `include` as follows:

```ts
await prisma.post.findMany({
  include: { tags: { include: { tag: true } } },
})
```

This will provide the following output:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Types of relations",
    "tags": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "postId": 1,
        "tagId": 1,
        "tag": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "prisma"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "postId": 1,
        "tagId": 2,
        "tag": {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "dev"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Sometimes, it's not ideal to show the data for the join table in your UI. In this case, it's best to map the data after fetching it on the server itself and sending that response to the frontend.

```ts
const result = posts.map(post => {
  return { ...post, tags: post.tags.map(tag => tag.tag) }
})
```

This will provide an output similar to the one you received with implicit relations.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Types of relations",
    "tags": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "prisma"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "dev"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

So this was how you can implement Implicit and Explicit many-to-many relations and querying for them using Prisma.
