[Prisma Postgres](/postgres) is a production-grade, cloud-native database and is ideal for staging and production environments. For rapid iteration and isolated testing, you can run a _local_ Prisma Postgres instance (powered by [PGlite](https://pglite.dev)). This page explains how to install and launch a local Prisma Postgres database.

:::note

Local Prisma Postgres is in [Early Access](/orm/more/releases#early-access) and is being actively developed.

:::

## Setting up local development for Prisma Postgres

Follow these steps to set up local Prisma Postgres for development.

:::note

Please ensure you're running Node.js 20 or later, as it's required for local Prisma Postgres.

:::

### 1. Launching local Prisma Postgres

Navigate into your project and start the local Prisma Postgres server using the following command:

```terminal
npx prisma dev
```

This starts a local Prisma Postgres server that you can connect to using Prisma ORM. 

The output of the command contains a `DATABASE_URL` and looks like this:

```
Great Success!

To connect to your local Prisma Postgres database via Prisma ORM, use the following connection string:
  
      DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://localhost:51213/?api_key=__API_KEY__"
```

Copy the `DATABASE_URL` and  store it in your `.env` file. This will be used to connect to the local Prisma Postgres server:

```bash file=.env
DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://localhost:51213/?api_key=__API_KEY__"
```

The `DATABASE_URL` is a connection string that Prisma uses to connect to the local Prisma Postgres server and is compatible with the [Prisma Postgres extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-accelerate):

```ts
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
```

This ensures no additional code changes are needed when switching from local Prisma Postgres to Prisma Postgres in production.

Keep the local Prisma Postgres server running in the background while you work on your application. 

### 2. Applying migrations and seeding data

Then in a separate terminal tab, run the `prisma migrate dev` command to create the database and run the migrations:

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev
```

:::note

Make sure the local Prisma Postgres server is running before running the `prisma migrate dev` command. 

If you must use a different port, append [`--port <number>`](/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference#dev) (for example, `npx prisma migrate dev --port 5422`) and update your `DATABASE_URL` (or other connection settings) to match. 

:::

This will create the database and run the migrations. 

If you have a seeder script to seed the database, you should also run it in this step.

### 3. Running your application locally

Start your application's development server. You can now perform queries against the local Prisma Postgres instance using Prisma ORM. 

To transition to production, you only need to update the database URL in the `.env` file with a Prisma Postgres connection url without additional application logic changes.

## Using different local Prisma Postgres instances

You can target a specific, local Prisma Postgres instance via the `--name` (`-n`) option of the `prisma dev` command, for example:

```terminal
npx prisma dev --name mydb1
```

Whenever you pass the `--name mydb1` to `prisma dev`, the command will return the same connection string pointing to a local instance called `mydb1`.

## Known limitations

### Caching is mocked locally

[Prisma Postgres caching](/postgres/database/caching) is simulated locally. Queries always directly interact with the local Prisma Postgres instance, bypassing cache configurations:

```typescript
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  cache: { ttl: 60 },
});
```

Caching works normally when you're using Prisma Postgres in staging and production.

### Single connection only

The local Prisma Postgres database server accepts one connection at a time. Additional connection attempts queue until the active connection closes. This constraint is sufficient for most local development and testing scenarios.

### Prisma Postgres limitations apply to the local Prisma Postgres database

All Prisma Postgres limitations also apply to local development for Prisma Postgres. Refer to the [Prisma Postgres limitations documentation](/postgres/more/known-limitations) for detailed information.

### No HTTPS connections

The local Prisma Postgres server doesn't use HTTPS. We advise against self-hosting it.
