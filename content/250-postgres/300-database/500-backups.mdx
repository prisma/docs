## Overview

On [Pro and Business plans](https://www.prisma.io/pricing), Prisma Postgres automatically creates snapshots of your database to support recovery and backup workflows. Navigate to the **Backups** tab of your Prisma Postgres instance in the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) to view and re-instantiate your available backups.

Snapshots are created _daily_, but only on days when the database has activity. Depending on your plan, you will see a different number of available snapshots:

| Plan     | Snapshot retention |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Pro      | Last 7 days        |
| Business | Last 30 days       |

Please note that any database changes or events that occurred after the most recent snapshot may not be restored.

For more details about backup availability and plan-specific features, visit our [pricing page](https://www.prisma.io/pricing).

:::note
In the future, Prisma Postgres will provide more fine-grained backup mechanisms based on user specific configurations and with point-in-time restore functionality.

## Manually creating a backup file via `pg_dump`

If you would like to create a backup file of your database, you can use `pg_dump` and use a [direct connection](/postgres/database/direct-connections). This is useful for migrating data between databases or creating a local copy of your database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** installed (version 16 or higher).
- **PostgreSQL CLI Tools** (`pg_dump`) for creating backups. Use Postgres version 17 as Prisma Postgres is based on this version.
- A **direct connection string** for your Prisma Postgres database.

## 1. Install PostgreSQL command-line tools

To create backups, ensure you have the PostgreSQL command-line tools installed. Run the following commands based on your operating system:

<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="macOS">

```terminal
brew install postgresql@17
which pg_dump
which pg_restore
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows">

```terminal
# Download from the official PostgreSQL website:
# https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
# During installation, select "Command Line Tools".
# Then verify with:

where pg_dump
where pg_restore
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Linux">

```terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client-17
which pg_dump
which pg_restore
```

</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

:::tip
If you installed PostgreSQL but still see a “command not found” error for `pg_dump` or `pg_restore`, ensure your installation directory is in your system’s `PATH` environment variable.

### 2. Creating the Backup with `pg_dump`

Get your direct connection string for Prisma Postgres by following the instructions [here](/postgres/database/direct-connections#how-to-connect-to-prisma-postgres-via-direct-tcp).

You can now dump the database by running the following command and using your own connection string:

```terminal
pg_dump --dbname="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@postgres.prisma-data.net:5432/?sslmode=require" > ./mydatabase.bak
```

This will create your backup file named `mydatabase.bak` in the current directory.
