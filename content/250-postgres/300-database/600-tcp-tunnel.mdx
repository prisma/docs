Prisma Postgres can be accessed securely via a TCP tunnel using the [`@prisma/ppg-tunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/ppg-tunnel) package, an authentication proxy designed for local database workflows. This package establishes a secure connection to Prisma Postgres through a local TCP server, enabling secure access while automatically handling traffic routing and authentication.

:::note

This is an [Early Access](/platform/maturity-levels#early-access) feature of Prisma Postgres. It is not recommended for production use and is not intended for application-level access. 

While in Early Access, usage of the TCP tunnel will be free of charge.

:::

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A [Prisma Postgres](/postgres) database connection string set as an environment variable called `DATABASE_URL`

### Exporting environment variables

The tunnel expects you to have the following `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set to the connection URL of your Prisma Postgres instance. If you are running the tunnel command from your project where an `.env` file has `DATABASE_URL` already set, you can skip this step as the tunnel will automatically pick it up.

To export the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable temporarily in a terminal session:

<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="macOS">

```terminal
export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Linux">

```terminal
export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows">

```terminal
set DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY"
```

</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

Replace the `API_KEY` placeholder with the API key value of your Prisma Postgres instance. 

### Starting the TCP tunnel

To start the proxy server, run the following command:

<CodeWithResult outputResultText="" expanded={true}>

<cmd>

```terminal
npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```code no-copy wrap
Prisma Postgres auth proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:52604 🚀

Your connection is authenticated using your Prisma Postgres API key.
...

==============================
hostname:  127.0.0.1
port:      52604
username:  <anything>
password:  <none>
==============================
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

This will start the tunnel on a randomly assigned TCP port. The proxy automatically handles authentication, so any database credentials are accepted. The tunnel also encrypts traffic, meaning clients should be set to not require SSL.

You can now connet to your Prisma Postgres editor using your favorite PostgreSQL client, e.g. `psql` or a GUI like [TablePlus](/postgres/tooling#2a-connect-to-prisma-postgres-using-tableplus) or [DataGrip](/postgres/tooling#2b-connect-to-prisma-postgres-using-datagrip). To do so, you only need to provide the **`host`** and  **`port`** from the output above. The TCP tunnel will handle authentication via the API key in your Prisma Postgres connection URL, so you can omit the values for  **`username`** and  **`password`**.


### Customizing host and port

By default, the tunnel listens on `127.0.0.1` and assigns a random port. Since it provides access to your Prisma Postgres database, it should only be exposed within a trusted network. You can specify a custom host and port using the `--host` and `--port` flags:

```terminal
npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5432
```

## Next steps

The local tunnel enables you to access Prisma Postgres from 3rd party database editors such as Postico, DataGrip, TablePlus and pgAdmin. Learn more in this [section](/postgres/tooling).

## Security considerations

When using the TCP tunnel, keep the following in mind:

- The tunnel does not support schema management (i.e., DDL queries outside of Prisma Migrate).
- The tunnel should not be exposed to untrusted networks.
- Always store API keys securely and avoid hardcoding them.
- Ensure that only necessary users have direct access to the Prisma Postgres database.
