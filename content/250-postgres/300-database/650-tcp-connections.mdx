## Overview

Prisma Postgres is the perfect choice for your applications, whether you connect to it via [Prisma ORM](/orm) or any other ORM, database library / tool of your choice.

If you use it with Prisma ORM, Prisma Postgres comes with built-in connection pooling and an integrated caching layer (powered by [Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate/)). If you connect to it via another tool, you can do so with a [direct TCP connection string](#connection-string) following the conventional PostgreSQL format.

:::note

Direct TCP access previously was possible via a _TCP tunnel_. This method has been deprecated in favor of direct TCP connections which are covered on this page.

## How to connect to Prisma Postgres via direct TCP

In order to get a direct TCP connection string, you need to:

1. open a project in your [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) account
1. navigate to a environment with an active Prisma Postgres instance in
1. click the **API Keys** tab in the project's sidenav
1. click the **Create API key** button 
1. in the popup, provide a **Name** for the API key and click **Create**
1. copy the connection string starting with `postgres://`, this is your direct TCP connection string

## Connection string

### Format

When you connect to Prisma Postgres via direct TCP, your [connection string](/orm/reference/connection-urls) looks as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@postgres.prisma-data.net:5432/?sslmode=require"
```

The `USER` and `PASSWORD` values are provided when you generate credentials for your Prisma Postgres instance in the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io). Here is an example with sample values:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://2f9881cc7eef46f094ac913df34c1fb441502fe66cbe28cc48998d4e6b20336b:sk_QZ3u8fMPFfBzOID4ol-mV@postgres.prisma-data.net:5432/?sslmode=require"
```

### SSL mode

SSL mode is required when connecting to Prisma Postgres via direct TCP, so you need to append `sslmode=require` to your TCP connection string.
