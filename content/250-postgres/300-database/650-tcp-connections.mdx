## Overview

Prisma Postgres is the perfect choice for your applications, whether you connect to it via [Prisma ORM](/orm) or any other ORM, database library / tool of your choice.

If you use it with Prisma ORM, Prisma Postgres comes with built-in connection pooling and an integrated caching layer (powered by [Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate/)). If you connect to it via another tool, you can do so with a [direct TCP connection string](#connection-string) following the conventional PostgreSQL format.

:::note

Direct TCP access previously was possible via a _TCP tunnel_. This method has been deprecated in favor of direct TCP connections which are covered on this page.

## How to connect to Prisma Postgres via direct TCP

In order to get a direct TCP connection string, you need to:

1. open a project in your [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) account (or create a new one)
1. navigate to a environment with an active Prisma Postgres instance
1. click the **API Keys** tab in the project's sidenav
1. click the **Create API key** button
1. in the popup, provide a **Name** for the API key and click **Create**
1. copy the connection string starting with `postgres://`, this is your direct TCP connection string

## Connection string

### Format

When you connect to Prisma Postgres via direct TCP, your [connection string](/orm/reference/connection-urls) looks as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@postgres.prisma-data.net:5432/?sslmode=require"
```

The `USER` and `PASSWORD` values are provided when you generate credentials for your Prisma Postgres instance in the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io). Here is an example with sample values:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://2f9881cc7eef46f094ac913df34c1fb441502fe66cbe28cc48998d4e6b20336b:sk_QZ3u8fMPFfBzOID4ol-mV@postgres.prisma-data.net:5432/?sslmode=require"
```

### SSL mode

SSL mode is required when connecting to Prisma Postgres via direct TCP, so you need to append `sslmode=require` to your TCP connection string.

## Pricing

## Temporary limitations

### Closing idle connections

Prisma Postgres closes idle connections after an extended period of time. If that happens in your application, you can re-open a new connection. (Most database clients re-connect automatically.)

### Connection limit

Depending on your [plan](https://prisma.io/pricing), the following database connection limits apply:

| Plan           | Connection limit |
| :------------- | :--------------- |
| Starter (Free) | 10               |
| Pro            | 50               |
| Business       | 250              |

### Query and transaction timeouts

The same query and transaction from Prisma Accelerate apply to Prisma Postgres when using direct TCP connections:

|                                      | Starter (Free)   | Pro              | Business         |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **Query timeout**                    | Up to 10 seconds | Up to 20 seconds | Up to 60 seconds |
| **Interactive transactions timeout** | Up to 15 seconds | Up to 30 seconds | Up to 90 seconds |

### Limited user permissions

User permissions are limited to read, write and schema changes. It is not possible to create separate databases, manage users and roles, or perform other administrative actions.
