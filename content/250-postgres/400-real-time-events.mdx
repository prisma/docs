Prisma Postgres comes with a built-in real-time event system (enabled by [Prisma Pulse](/pulse/)) that lets you react to changes in your database.

:::note

To receive real-time events, ensure that Prisma Pulse is enabled in your Prisma Postgres setup. Learn how to enable it [here](/getting-started/quickstart-prismaPostgres#7-observe-real-time-events-in-your-database-with-prisma-pulse).

:::

Prisma Pulse is a fully managed and robust [Change Data Capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) (CDC) service that provides delivery guarantees for all change events happening in your database.

Here is an example for how you can stream data changes on the `User` table in your application:

```ts
const stream = await prisma.user.stream()

for await (const event of stream) {
  console.log('just received an event:', event)
}
```

Check out the [database events](/pulse/database-events) documentation for details.
