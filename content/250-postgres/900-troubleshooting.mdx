This guide helps resolve common issues when working with Prisma Postgres.

## The `--db` option is not recognized when running `prisma init` 

### Problem

Running the following command fails because the `--db` option is not recognized:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db
```

### Cause

This can occur due to npx caching. If you've previously run `npx prisma init`, your machine may be using an outdated cached version that doesn't recognize the `--db` flag because it was only introduced in a later version of Prisma ORM.

### Solution

Explicitly run the `latest` Prisma CLI version:

```terminal
npx prisma@latest init --db
```

This ensures that you're using the most up-to-date CLI, preventing issues with outdated command syntax.

##  Warning: In production, we recommend using `prisma generate --no-engine`

### Problem

You're seeing the following error in your logs:

```
prisma:warn: In production, we recommend using 'prisma generate --no-engine'
```

### Cause

Prisma ORM by default uses a [query engine](/orm/overview/) binary that's deployed as part of the `@prisma/client` package. However, with Prisma Postgres, this is not needed.

### Solution

To remove this warning and generate Prisam Client without the query engine, you can run the following command:

```
npx prisma generate --no-engine
```
