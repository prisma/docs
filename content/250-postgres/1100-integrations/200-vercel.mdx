The [Vercel Marketplace integration for Prisma Postgres](https://www.vercel.com/marketplace/prisma) connects your Vercel projects with Prisma Postgres instances. Once connected, the integration will automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable on your deployed Vercel app.

## Features

- Create and use Prisma Postgres instances without leaving the Vercel dashboard. 
- Automatic generation of Prisma Postgres URLs keys for production and preview environments.
- Simplified environment configuration for your Vercel project.
- Billing workflows to up-/ and downgrade your Prisma Postgres pricing plan.
- Ready-to-deploy fullstack Next.js [template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/prisma-postgres) with authentication.

## Usage

> **Note**: The easiest way to use the Prisma Postgres extension is via the [Next.js Auth Template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/prisma-postgres).

### Install the extension

To install the extension, click **Install** at the top of the [Prisma Postgres integration page](https://www.vercel.com/marketplace/prisma).

The integration will now show up on your list of integrations, e.g. `https://vercel.com/<VERCEL-TEAM>/~/integrations`.

### Create a new database

Once installed, you can navigate to the **Storage** tab and click **Create Database**.

Select **Prisma Postgres** and click **Continue**. Then select the **Region** for the database and a **Pricing Plan**,  and click **Continue** again.

Finally, give the database a **Name** and click **Create**. 

The database is now ready and can be connected to your Vercel projects.

### Connect database to Vercel project

In your Vercel project, you can now click the **Storage** tab, select the database you just created and then click **Connect**. This will automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in that project and enable your application to access your newly created Prisma Postgres instance. 

### Viewing and editing data in Prisma Studio

To view and edit the data in your Prisma Postgres instance, you can use the local version of [Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio). 

In the local version of your project where you have your `DATABASE_URL` set, run the following command to open Prisma Studio:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

## Additional considerations

### Ensure your project uses the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

Ensure that the data source in your `schema.prisma` file is configured to use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```prisma
// schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

### Generate Prisma Client in a `postinstall` script in `package.json`

To ensure the generated Prisma Client library is available on your deployed Vercel project, you should add a `postinstall` script to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file:

```js file=package.json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    // add-next-line
    "postinstall": "prisma generate --no-engine"
  }
  //
}
```

The `--no-engine` flag ensures that the query engine binary is kept out of the generated Prisma Client library. It's not needed when using Prisma Postgres.

## Example: Deploy a Next.js template with Prisma Postgres

To get started you can deploy our [Next.js starter template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/prisma-postgres) and connect via Prisma Postgres instance during the deployment flow.

<!-- This section contains step-by-step instructions for deploying a fullstack Next.js app and connecting it to Prisma Postgres from scratch using the official [Vercel template for Next.js & Prisma Postgres](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/prisma-postgres) template.

### 1. Deploy the template

Navigate to the [template on vercel.com/templates](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/prisma-postgres) and click **Deploy**. -->
