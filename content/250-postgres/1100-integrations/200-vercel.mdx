The [Vercel Marketplace integration for Prisma Postgres](https://www.vercel.com/marketplace/prisma) connects your Vercel projects with Prisma Postgres instances. Once connected, the integration will automatically set the following environment variables on your deployed Vercel app:

`POSTGRES_URL`: The [direct TCP connection URL](/postgres/database/direct-connections) starting with `postgres://...`
`PRISMA_DATABASE_URL`: The connection URL used by Prisma ORM starting with `prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey...`
`DATABASE_URL`: The [direct TCP connection URL](/postgres/database/direct-connections) starting with `postgres://...`

These enable you to connect to the Prisma Postgres instances via any ORM or database library you want to use (Prisma ORM, Drizzle, Kysely, ...).

## Features

- Create and use Prisma Postgres instances without leaving the Vercel dashboard. 
- Automatic generation of Prisma Postgres URLs for production and preview environments.
- Simplified environment configuration for your Vercel project.
- Billing workflows to up-/ and downgrade your Prisma Postgres pricing plan.
- Ready-to-deploy fullstack templates for Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit and with various ORMs and DB libraries.

## Templates

The easiest way to use Prisma Postgres on the Vercel Marketplace is via one of the templates:

- [Prisma ORM + NextAuth Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/prisma-postgres)
- [Postgres + Nuxt Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/nuxt/postgres-nuxt)
- [Postgres + Kysely Next.js Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/postgres-kysely)
- [Postgres + Drizzle Next.js Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/postgres-drizzle)
- [Postgres + SvelteKit Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/svelte/postgres-sveltekit)
- [Next.js SaaS Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/authentication/next-js-saas-starter)

## Usage

### Install the extension

To install the extension, click **Install** at the top of the [Prisma Postgres integration page](https://www.vercel.com/marketplace/prisma).

The integration will now show up on your list of integrations, e.g. `https://vercel.com/<VERCEL-TEAM>/~/integrations`.

### Create a new database

Once installed, you can navigate to the **Storage** tab and click **Create Database**.

Select **Prisma Postgres** and click **Continue**. Then select the **Region** for the database and a **Pricing Plan**,  and click **Continue** again.

Finally, give the database a **Name** and click **Create**. 

The database is now ready and can be connected to your Vercel projects.

### Connect database to Vercel project

In your Vercel project, you can now click the **Storage** tab, select the database you just created and then click **Connect**. This will automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in that project and enable your application to access your newly created Prisma Postgres instance. 

### Viewing and editing data in Prisma Studio

To view and edit the data in your Prisma Postgres instance, you can use the local version of [Prisma Studio](/orm/tools/prisma-studio). 

In the local version of your project where you have your `DATABASE_URL` set, run the following command to open Prisma Studio:

```terminal
npx prisma studio
```

## Additional considerations when using with Prisma ORM

### Ensure your project uses the correct environment variable

Ensure that the data source in your `schema.prisma` file is configured to use the `DATABASE_URL` or `PRISMA_DATABASE_URL` environment variable (depending on which one is being exported in the **Settings** of your Vercel project):

```prisma
// schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

### Generate Prisma Client in a `postinstall` script in `package.json`

To ensure the generated Prisma Client library is available on your deployed Vercel project, you should add a `postinstall` script to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file:

```js file=package.json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    // add-next-line
    "postinstall": "prisma generate --no-engine"
  }
  //
}
```

The `--no-engine` flag ensures that the query engine binary is kept out of the generated Prisma Client library. It's not needed when using Prisma Postgres.
