## Overview

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode) includes an **agent** mode (powered by GitHub Copilot) that automatically performs code changes and executes Prisma CLI commands based on your prompts.

## Capabilities

The [Prisma Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) enables the agent to perform the following tasks using our Model Context Protocol (MCP) server:

- Manage Prisma Data Platform projects.
- Provision new databases.
- Run migrations and generate the Prisma Client.
- Generate Prisma schemas and client code.
- Execute Prisma commands directly in the terminal.

This integration removes the need to manually run MCP commands, significantly speeding your database-related workflows.

## How to enable and use the VS Code agent

The [latest version of the Prisma VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) fully supports agent mode. Since extensions update automatically, no manual action is required to enable it.

:::note

We recommend you to use the latest version of Prisma ORM.

:::

To use the agent mode:

1.  Open [GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code and switch to **Agent** mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_use-agent-mode).
2.  With GitHub Copilot Chat open and the Prisma extension updated, you can simply type a request such as: "Create a new database for me and add the connection string to the .env file".
3.  The agent will request permission to make changes in your workspace.
4.  It automatically handles login to your Prisma Data Platform account before proceeding.
5.  Upon approval, the agent creates the new database and adds the connection string to your `.env` file.
6.  You can also use agent mode to run migrations, generate the Prisma Client, and perform other tasks.

:::note
Currently, the agent mode uses your default workspace in the Prisma Data Platform.

## Querying Prisma docs from VS Code using GitHub Copilot

Complementing the agent, the Prisma Copilot extension allows you to query Prisma documentation directly within VS Code.

You need to install the [Prisma for Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) from the GitHub marketplace.

Then, [switch to **Ask** mode in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode) and type your question using the `@prisma` namespace.

For more details, refer to our [GitHub Copilot documentation](/orm/more/ai-tools/github-copilot).
