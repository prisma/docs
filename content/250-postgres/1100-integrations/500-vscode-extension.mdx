## Overview

With over 2.5M installs and 350K MAU's, the [Prisma VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) is a powerful tool when you're building applications with Prisma Postgres with VS Code as your editor.

## Database management UI

The Prisma VS Code extension includes a dedicated UI to manage Prisma Postgres instances (local and remote).

### Workflows

The UI enables the following workflows:

- Authenticate with the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io)
- View, create and delete  Prisma Postgres instances (local & remote)
- "Push to cloud": Easily deploy a local Prisma Postgres instance
- View and edit data via an embedded Prisma Studio
- Visualize your database schema

### Usage

To manage Prisma Postgres instances via the UI in the Prisma VS Code extension:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of the [Prisma VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) installed
1. Find the Prisma logo in the **Activity Bar**
1. Click the **Sign in to get started** button
1. Authenticate with the [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) via the popup and select a target [workspace](/platform/about#workspace)

## Prisma Studio Built-in

Beyond managing your database instances, the Prisma VS Code extension embeds Prisma Studio directly in your editor making it easy to perform create, update, delete steps on your database from right inside of VS Code. Follow these [easy steps](/postgres/database/prisma-studio/studio-in-vs-code) to get started.

## Agent mode

VS Code includes an [agent mode](https://pris.ly/vs-code-docs) (powered by GitHub Copilot) that automatically performs code changes and executes Prisma CLI commands based on your prompts.

### Capabilities

The [Prisma VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) enables support for VS Code agent mode. 

VS Code agent mode can perform the following tasks:

- Check migration status (e.g. Flag unapplied migrations)
- Create and apply schema migrations automatically
- Sign in to the Prisma Data Platform
- Provision Prisma Postgres instances, letting you start coding right away

### How to enable and use the VS Code agent

The [latest version of the Prisma VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) fully supports agent mode. Since extensions update automatically, no manual action is required to enable it.

:::note
We recommend you to use the latest version of Prisma ORM.

To use the agent mode:

1.  Open [GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code and switch to **Agent** mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_use-agent-mode).
2.  With GitHub Copilot Chat open and the Prisma extension updated, you can simply type a request such as: "Create a new database for me and add the connection string to the .env file".
3.  The agent will request permission to make changes in your workspace.
4.  It automatically handles login to your Prisma Data Platform account before proceeding.
5.  Upon approval, the agent creates the new database and adds the connection string to your `.env` file.
6.  You can also use agent mode to run migrations, generate the Prisma Client, and perform other tasks.

:::note
Currently, the agent mode uses your default [workspace](/platform/about#workspace) in the Prisma Data Platform.

### Querying Prisma docs from VS Code using GitHub Copilot

Complementing the agent, the Prisma Copilot extension allows you to query Prisma documentation directly within VS Code.

You need to install the [Prisma for Copilot extension](https://github.com/apps/prisma-for-github-copilot) from the GitHub marketplace.

Then, [switch to **Ask** mode in GitHub Copilot Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode) and type your question using the `@prisma-for-github-copilot` namespace.

For more details, refer to our [GitHub Copilot documentation](/orm/more/ai-tools/github-copilot).
