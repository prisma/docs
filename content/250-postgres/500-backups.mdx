Prisma Postgres takes full snapshots of your database every 24 hours to back up your data. If you need to access a database backup, [reach out to our Support team](mailto:support@prisma.io).

In the future, Prisma Postgres will provide more fine-grained backup mechanisms based on user specific configurations and with point-in-time restore functionality.
