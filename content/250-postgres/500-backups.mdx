Prisma Postgres takes full snapshots of your database every 24 hours to back up your data. If you need to access a database backup, [reach out to our Support team](mailto:support@prisma.io) from the email address associated with your Prisma Data Platform account. Doing so helps us verify your account quickly and expedite the restoration process.

Please note that any database changes or events that occurred after the most recent snapshot may not be restored.

In the future, Prisma Postgres will provide more fine-grained backup mechanisms based on user specific configurations and with point-in-time restore functionality.
