Prisma Postgres takes full snapshots of your database every 24 hours to back up your data. If you need to access a database backup, [reach out to our Support team](mailto:support@prisma.io) from the email address associated with your Prisma Data Platform account. Doing so helps us verify your account quickly and expedite the restoration process.

Please note that any database changes or events that occurred after the most recent snapshot may not be restored.

In the future, Prisma Postgres will provide more fine-grained backup mechanisms based on user specific configurations and with point-in-time restore functionality.

## Creating Backup file via `@prisma/ppg-tunnel`

If you would like to create a backup file of your database, you can use the `@prisma/ppg-tunnel` CLI. This is useful for migrating data between databases or creating a local copy of your database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** installed (version 16 or higher).
- **PostgreSQL CLI Tools** (`pg_dump`) for creating backups. Use Postgres version 17 as Prisma Postgres is based on this version.
- A **Database connection string** for your Prisma Postgres database.

To create backups, ensure you have the PostgreSQL command-line tools installed. Run the following commands based on your operating system:

<TabbedContent code>

<TabItem value="macOS">

```terminal
brew install postgresql@17
which pg_dump
which pg_restore
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows">

```terminal
# Download from the official PostgreSQL website:
# https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
# During installation, select "Command Line Tools".
# Then verify with:

where pg_dump
where pg_restore
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Linux">

```terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client-17
which pg_dump
which pg_restore
```

</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

:::tip
If you installed PostgreSQL but still see a ‚Äúcommand not found‚Äù error for pg_dump or pg_restore, ensure your installation directory is in your system‚Äôs PATH environment variable.
:::

:::note
Please make sure that you are installing Postgresql version 17. Other versions may cause errors during the backup process.

### 1. Connecting to the database directly with `@prisma/ppg-tunnel`

In your terminal, run `npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel` to establish a secure tunnel to your database.

If you already have a `.env` file in your current directory with `DATABASE_URL` set, the tunnel CLI will automatically pick it up‚Äîno need to manually export it. However, if you haven't set up a `.env` file, you'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable explicitly.

To set environment variable (with your actual database URL):
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI..."
```
:::note
If you explicitly set `DATABASE_URL` in your terminal, that value will take precedence over the one in your `.env` file.
:::

Run the tunnel:
```bash
npx @prisma/ppg-tunnel --host 127.0.0.1  --port 5432
```

You can provide any other port if you wish. A random port is assigned if no port value is provided.
You should see output similar to:

```cmd
Prisma Postgres auth proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:5432 üöÄ

Your connection is authenticated using your Prisma Postgres API key.
...

==============================
hostname:  127.0.0.1
port:      5432
username:  <anything>
password:  <none>
==============================
```

:::note
Please note that the port you will see in your output will be a randomly assigned port which may be different from the one mentioned here.
Also, Keep this terminal window open so the tunnel remains active! If you close it, the tunnel disconnects.
:::

Copy the port number from the terminal output, you‚Äôll need it in the next step for the `pg_dump` command.

### 2. Creating the Backup with `pg_dump`

With the tunnel running, you can now dump the database by running the following command:
```bash
PGSSLMODE=disable \
pg_dump \
  -h 127.0.0.1 \
  -p 5432 \
  -Fc \
  -v \
  -d postgres \
  -f ./mydatabase.bak \
&& echo "-complete-"
```

`PGSSLMODE=disable` indicates SSL is not required locally because the tunnel already encrypts the connection.

```
`-h` is the host (127.0.0.1)
`-p` is the port, which should match the one from the tunnel output.
`-Fc` uses the custom format for backups, recommended for pg_restore.
`-d` postgres is the default database name used in Prisma Postgres.
`-f` ./mydatabase.bak specifies the backup file name and location.
`-v` runs pg_dump in verbose mode.
```

This should create your backup file named `mydatabase.bak` in the current directory.
