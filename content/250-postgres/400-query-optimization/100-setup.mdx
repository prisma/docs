## Prerequisites

Before you begin with Prisma Optimize for Prisma Postgres, ensure you have the following:

- A [Prisma Data Platform account](https://console.prisma.io/optimize?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=optimize-page).
- A project using [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) version `5.0.0` or higher (we recommend using the latest version).
- A [Prisma Postgres database](/postgres/getting-started).

:::note

Prisma Optimize is intended for use in local environments. Learn more in the [FAQ](/postgres/more/faq#can-i-enable-query-optimizations-for-prisma-postgres-in-production).

:::

## 1. Launch Optimize

1. Log in to your [Prisma Data Platform account](https://console.prisma.io/optimize?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=ppg_optimize_page).
2. Click the **Optimize** tab on the left navigation.
3. Click the **Generate API key** button.
4. Copy the API key that appears and paste it somewhere safe, like a password manager.
5. Click the copy icons to continue through each setup screen until you see the **Finish & optimize** button. Click that to complete the setup.
6. Once you're done, Optimize will automatically begin a new recording session in the background.

## 2. Add Optimize to your application

### 2.1. Install the required Prisma Client extension

Run the following command in your terminal to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install @prisma/extension-optimize
```

### 2.2. Add the Optimize API Key to your `.env` file

Copy the Prisma Optimize API key and add it to your `.env` file:

```bash
OPTIMIZE_API_KEY="YOUR_OPTIMIZE_API_KEY"
```

### 2.3. Extend your Prisma Client instance

Extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Optimize extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '../path/to/generated/prisma/client';
import { withOptimize } from "@prisma/extension-optimize";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withOptimize({ apiKey: process.env.OPTIMIZE_API_KEY }),
).$extends(withAccelerate());
```

#### Using the Optimize extension with other extensions

Since [extensions are applied one after another](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions#conflicts-in-combined-extensions), make sure you apply them in the correct order. Extensions cannot share behavior and the last extension applied takes precedence.

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
  .$extends(withOptimize())
  .$extends(withAccelerate())
```

### 2.5. Use Prisma Optimize to generate insights

Follow these steps to start generating query insights with Prisma Optimize:

1. Run your app and execute some Prisma queries while recording is active.
2. After your app runs and generates insights based on the executed Prisma queries, click the red **Recording** button.
3. Explore [individual query details](/postgres/query-optimization/recordings#data-captured-in-a-recording-session) by clicking on them, and check the **Recommendations** tab for any suggested improvements to enhance query performance.
