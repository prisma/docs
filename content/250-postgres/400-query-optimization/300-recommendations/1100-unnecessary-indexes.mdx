Optimize detects unnecessary indexes and recommends removing them to improve database performance.

### Why this is a problem

Indexes enhance database query performance but can harm efficiency when overused. They consume storage and add overhead to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations. Unnecessary indexes can result in:

- **Increased write costs:** Extra indexes slow down write operations.
- **Higher storage use:** Unused indexes waste storage space.
- **Query optimizer confusion:** Redundant indexes may cause inefficient query plans.

Removing unnecessary indexes improves performance and simplifies maintenance.
