Optimize provides recommendations to help you identify and resolve performance issues caused by the use of `@db.Timestamp(0)` and `@db.Timestamptz(0)` native types in PostgreSQL.

The `@db.Timestamp(0)` and `@db.Timestamptz(0)` native types have been used within the following `User` model:

```prisma
model User {
  // ...
  date DateTime @db.Timestamp(0)
  deletedAt DateTime @db.Timestamptz(0)
  // ...
}
```

### Why this is a problem

When using a `@db.Timestamp(n)` or `@db.Timestamptz(n)` column with a precision of `0`, the database rounds the time to the nearest whole second, which can lead to unexpected results. 

For example, if you insert the current time, such as `15:30:45.678`, into a column with this precision, it will round up to `15:30:46`. This behavior can cause the recorded time to appear up to half a second in the future compared to the original time, which may be surprising when precise time accuracy is critical.
