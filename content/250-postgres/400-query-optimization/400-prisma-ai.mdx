Prisma AI enables you to ask follow-up questions on a provided [recommendation](/postgres/query-optimization/recommendations) for additional clarity.

## Using the Prisma AI

To interact with the Prisma AI:

1. Select a recommendation from an Optimize [recording](/postgres/query-optimization/recordings).
2. Click the **Ask AI** button.

Prisma AI helps you gain deeper insights into a recommendation and learn how to apply it effectively to your Prisma model.
