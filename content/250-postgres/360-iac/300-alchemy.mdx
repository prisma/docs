Use [Alchemy](https://alchemy.run) to manage Prisma Postgres resources directly in your infrastructure code.

Alchemy provides Prisma Postgres resources for:

- Projects
- Databases
- Connections
- Workspace references

## Conceptual model

Alchemy is a TypeScript library that creates and manages infrastructure when you run it.

Instead of a separate declarative config format, you write a normal TypeScript program (commonly `alchemy.run.ts`) and execute it.

Alchemy resources follow lifecycle phases (`create`, `update`, `delete`) and manage provider APIs for you:

- You compose resources in code (`Project`, `Database`, `Connection`).
- Alchemy handles dependency ordering between those resources.
- Resource defaults can include safety behavior, such as delete protection on projects and databases.
- `await app.finalize()` cleans up orphaned resources that are no longer in your program.

This makes it useful when you want infrastructure code that feels close to your application runtime and platform integrations.

## When to use Alchemy

Alchemy is a strong fit when:

- You are already deploying with Alchemy and want Prisma Postgres in the same graph.
- You want resource composition with first-class platform integrations (for example, Hyperdrive + Workers).
- You prefer lifecycle-driven resource code with safe deletion defaults.

## Typical workflow

If you follow the Alchemy getting started flow, the common lifecycle is:

```terminal
# create project scaffold (optional)
bunx alchemy@latest create --template typescript

# configure provider profiles/credentials
bun alchemy configure

# authenticate (required for Cloudflare resources)
bun alchemy login

# local development with hot reload
bun alchemy dev

# deploy
bun alchemy deploy

# tear down
bun alchemy destroy
```

For Prisma Postgres-only resources, `configure`/`login` may not be necessary in every setup. They are typically needed when you also manage Cloudflare resources in the same app.

For script execution, Alchemy also supports direct Bun/Node execution equivalents documented in the "What is Alchemy?" page.

## Prerequisites

- An Alchemy project
- A Prisma service token
- `PRISMA_SERVICE_TOKEN` configured in your environment
- `ALCHEMY_PASSWORD` configured when your resources contain secrets

## Authentication

Alchemy reads Prisma credentials from environment variables by default.

```terminal
export PRISMA_SERVICE_TOKEN="prsc_your_token_here"
export ALCHEMY_PASSWORD="choose-a-strong-password"
```

If you need multiple workspaces/accounts, you can override auth per resource with `serviceToken`.

`ALCHEMY_PASSWORD` is used to encrypt/decrypt secret values in Alchemy state.

## Minimal example

```ts file=alchemy.run.ts
import alchemy from "alchemy";
import { Connection, Database, Project } from "alchemy/prisma-postgres";

const app = await alchemy("prisma-postgres-example");

const project = await Project("project");

const database = await Database("database", {
  project,
  region: "us-east-1",
});

const connection = await Connection("connection", {
  database,
  name: "app-connection",
});

export const projectId = project.id;
export const databaseId = database.id;
export const host = connection.host;
export const user = connection.user;
export const connectionString = connection.connectionString;
export const prismaConnectionString = connection.prismaConnectionString;

await app.finalize();
```

## Use with Prisma ORM

Alchemy returns both connection formats:

- `connection.prismaConnectionString`: `prisma+postgres://...` (use as `DATABASE_URL`)
- `connection.connectionString`: `postgres://...` (use as `DIRECT_URL` or direct TCP clients)

Expose both from your infrastructure code so your app environment can consume them:

```ts file=alchemy.run.ts
export const DATABASE_URL = connection.prismaConnectionString;
export const DIRECT_URL = connection.connectionString;
```

If you use `prisma.config.ts`:

```ts file=prisma.config.ts
import "dotenv/config";
import { defineConfig, env } from "prisma/config";

export default defineConfig({
  schema: "prisma/schema.prisma",
  datasource: {
    url: env("DATABASE_URL"),
    directUrl: env("DIRECT_URL"),
  },
});
```

Example Prisma schema:

```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

Quick check:

```terminal
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## Complete example with Hyperdrive + Worker

```ts file=alchemy.run.ts
import alchemy from "alchemy";
import { Hyperdrive, Worker } from "alchemy/cloudflare";
import { Connection, Database, Project } from "alchemy/prisma-postgres";

const app = await alchemy("prisma-postgres-example");

const project = await Project("project");

const database = await Database("database", {
  project,
  region: "us-east-1",
});

const connection = await Connection("connection", {
  database,
  name: "connection",
});

const db = await Hyperdrive("prisma-postgres", {
  origin: connection.connectionString.unencrypted,
});

export const worker = await Worker("worker", {
  entrypoint: "src/worker.ts",
  bindings: {
    HYPERDRIVE: db,
  },
  compatibilityFlags: ["nodejs_compat"],
});

await app.finalize();
```

```ts file=src/worker.ts
import { Client } from "pg";
import type { worker } from "../alchemy.run.ts";

export default {
  async fetch(_request: Request, env: typeof worker.Env): Promise<Response> {
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });

    try {
      await client.connect();
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");

      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      return new Response(`Database error: ${error.message}`, { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

## Working with multiple workspaces

Prisma service tokens are workspace-scoped. You can pass different tokens to different resources:

```ts
import alchemy from "alchemy";
import { Project } from "alchemy/prisma-postgres";

const app = await alchemy("prisma-workspaces");

const workspaceAProject = await Project("workspace-a-project", {
  serviceToken: alchemy.env.PRISMA_SERVICE_TOKEN_WORKSPACE_A,
});

const workspaceBProject = await Project("workspace-b-project", {
  serviceToken: alchemy.env.PRISMA_SERVICE_TOKEN_WORKSPACE_B,
});

await app.finalize();
```

If you need to resolve a workspace by name or id, use `WorkspaceRef`:

```ts
import { WorkspaceRef } from "alchemy/prisma-postgres";

const workspace = await WorkspaceRef("my-workspace");
```

## Deletion behavior

`Project` and `Database` default to delete protection in Alchemy.

- `Project`: `delete` defaults to `false`
- `Database`: `delete` defaults to `false`

For ephemeral environments, set `delete: true` explicitly:

```ts
const testDatabase = await Database("test-db", {
  project,
  region: "us-east-1",
  delete: true,
});
```

## Common troubleshooting

### Missing token

If resource creation fails with an auth error, confirm `PRISMA_SERVICE_TOKEN` is set for the process running Alchemy.

### Wrong workspace

Prisma service tokens are workspace-scoped. If resources appear in the wrong workspace, use per-resource `serviceToken` overrides.
