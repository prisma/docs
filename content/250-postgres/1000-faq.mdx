## Can the TCP tunnel be used for direct database access?  

The TCP tunnel is designed for secure database access in local workflows. It enables connections to Prisma Postgres for importing data, working with third-party database editors, and other development tasks. However, it is **not** intended for production use or direct application-level access.  

For security reasons, the tunnel should only be used in trusted environments and should not be exposed to public networks.
