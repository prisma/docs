## Does query execution time affect pricing in Prisma Postgres?

No, the cost is based solely on the number of operations, not the amount of compute required to execute them. Whether a query takes `10`ms or `10`s to execute, its pricing impact remains the same.

## Do read and write queries cost the same?

Yes, read and write queries are counted equally as operations, meaning they are billed the same way.

## Does a `SELECT 1` query (that doesn’t interact with data) count as a billable operation?

Yes it counts as an operation and will be billed accordingly, even if no actual data is retrieved.

## Can I use Prisma Postgres without Prisma Client?  

Prisma Postgres is designed to be used with Prisma Client and the Accelerate extension for the best performance, reliability, and support.  

While it is technically possible to connect via the [**TCP tunnel**](/postgres/tcp-tunnel), this is **only intended for tooling purposes**—such as database query editors.  

We **do not recommend** using the TCP tunnel for application-level access or integrating Prisma Postgres with other ORMs, as it is not optimized for that use case and may result in performance limitations.
