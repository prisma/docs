The easiest ways to get started with Prisma Postgres is by following these guides:

- [**Start from scratch**](/getting-started/quickstart-prismaPostgres)
- [**Import data from an existing database**](/getting-started/prisma-postgres/import-from-existing-database-postgresql)

If you are looking to explore Prisma Postgres in a fullstack project, check out these resources:

- [**Build a fullstack app with Next.js 15**](/guides/nextjs)
- [**Next.js 15 example app**](https://github.com/prisma/nextjs-prisma-postgres-demo) (including authentication)

:::note

When you are using Prisma Postgres, you don't need to include the query engine in the generated Prisma Client code. Make sure to always generate it using the `--no-engine` flag:

```
prisma generate --no-engine
```
