## Quickstart


To **bootstrap a new Prisma ORM project with a Prisma Postgres database**, run the following command in your terminal:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db
```

After running this command, the terminal will guide you with next steps. Follow [this page](/getting-started/prisma-postgres/from-the-cli) to complete the setup for your first Prisma Postgres project.

:::note
If you need a database quickly for testing, or want to try out Prisma Postgres, you can run the following command to spin up a temporary 24-hour database: 

```terminal
npx create-db@latest
```

You can learn more about `npx create-db` in [the dedicated documentation](/postgres/introduction/npx-create-db).

## Prisma ORM

The easiest ways to get started with Prisma Postgres is by following these guides:

- [**Start from scratch**](/getting-started/quickstart-prismaPostgres)
- [**Import data from an existing database**](/getting-started/prisma-postgres/import-from-existing-database-postgresql)

If you are looking to explore Prisma Postgres in a fullstack project, check out these resources:

- [**Build a fullstack app with Next.js 15**](/guides/nextjs)
- [**Next.js 15 example app**](https://github.com/prisma/nextjs-prisma-postgres-demo) (including authentication)

:::note

When you are using Prisma Postgres, you don't need to include the query engine in the generated Prisma Client code. Make sure to always generate it using the `--no-engine` flag:

```terminal
prisma generate --no-engine
```

## Connect via any database library / tool

You can access Prisma Postgres with any ORM or database tool of your choice via [direct TCP connections](/postgres/database/direct-connections).

In order to get a direct TCP connection string, you need to:
1. open a project in your [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) account (or create a new one)
1. navigate to a environment with an active Prisma Postgres instance
1. click the **API Keys** tab in the project's sidenav
1. click the **Create API key** button 
1. in the popup, provide a **Name** for the API key and click **Create**
1. copy the connection string starting with `postgres://`, this is your direct TCP connection string

Once you have the connection string, you can follow the setup docs for PostgreSQL of any ORM or database tool:
