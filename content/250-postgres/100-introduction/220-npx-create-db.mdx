[`create-db`](https://create-db.prisma.io/) is an open-source CLI tool that provisions temporary [Prisma Postgres](/postgres) databases with a single command.

- **Fast setup:** No sign-up required to create a temporary production-ready Prisma Postgres database.
- **Lifetime:** Each database is available for _24 hours_ by default.
- **Keep for free:** You can _claim_ a database (via the URL provided in the CLI output) to make it permanent.


## Prerequisites

To use `npx create-db`, you need:

- **Node.js** version `16` or higher (we recommend the latest LTS version).
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) to run `npx` commands.

**A Prisma Data Platform account is not required** to create a temporary database. However, if you want to keep a database permanently, you can claim it ([details below](#claiming-your-database)).


## Getting started

You can create a database using one of the following options:

### Option 1: Quick start with default settings

Run the following command in your terminal:

```terminal
npx create-db@latest
```

<br/>

- The `@latest` tag automatically downloads and runs the latest version of the tool, hence, no global installation required.
- After a few seconds, you'll receive **connection strings** for both Prisma ORM projects and standard PostgreSQL.
- The default region is `us-east-1`. You can specify the region where you want to provision the database in using the `--region` flag. See [the section below](#available-cli-options) to view all the CLI options.



### Option 2: Choose a region interactively

If you want to select a region manually:

```terminal
npx create-db@latest --interactive
```

<br/>

- This opens a region selection menu (for example, `us-east-1`, `eu-west-3`).
- Alternatively, you can use the shorthand `-i`:

```terminal
npx create-db@latest -i
```

To view all options and regions:

```terminal
npx create-db@latest --help
```

## CLI output walkthrough

Here is an example output:

```
‚îå  üöÄ Creating a Prisma Postgres database
‚îÇ
‚îÇ  Provisioning a temporary database in us-east-1...
‚îÇ
‚îÇ  It will be automatically deleted in 24 hours, but you can claim it.
‚îÇ
‚óá  Database created successfully!
‚îÇ
‚óè  Connect to your database ‚Üí
‚îÇ
‚îÇ    Use this connection string optimized for Prisma ORM:
‚îÇ    prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=...
‚îÇ
‚îÇ    Use this connection string for everything else:
‚îÇ    postgresql://<username>:<password>@db.prisma.io:5432/postgres
‚îÇ
‚óÜ  Claim your database ‚Üí
‚îÇ
‚îÇ    Want to keep your database? Claim for free:
‚îÇ    https://create-db.prisma.io?projectID=proj_...
‚îî
```


Once you have the output, take the **Prisma ORM-optimized connection string** (`prisma+postgres://...`) and add it to your `.env` file as `DATABASE_URL`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=..."
```

You can now follow the [Prisma Postgres quickstart guide](/getting-started/quickstart-prismaPostgres#3-set-database-connection-url) to connect your Prisma project to this database.

If you're using other tools or libraries, use the **standard PostgreSQL connection string** (`postgresql://...`) with any PostgreSQL-compatible client, such as `psql`, `pgAdmin`, `node-postgres`, or an ORM of your choice. Detailed instructions are available in the guide for [connecting via direct PostgreSQL connection string](/postgres/database/direct-connections).


## Claiming your database

By default, databases created with `npx create-db` are **temporary** and will be automatically deleted after **24 hours**.

You can prevent this by **claiming the database** using the claim URL shown in the CLI output:

```
‚óÜ  Claim your database ‚Üí
‚îÇ
‚îÇ    Want to keep your database? Claim for free:
‚îÇ
‚îÇ    https://create-db.prisma.io?projectID=proj_...
‚îÇ
‚îÇ    Your database will be deleted on 7/24/2025, 2:25:41 AM if not claimed.
```

To claim your database and make it permanent:

1. Copy the **claim URL** from the CLI output.
2. Open it in your browser and click **Claim database**.
3. Sign in to your [Prisma Data Platform account](https://console.prisma.io/) (or create one if you don‚Äôt have it yet).
4. Choose a **Workspace** that has capacity for creating new projects.
5. Click **Authorize Prisma Create DB** to confirm.
6. You‚Äôll be redirected to a success page. Then, click **Go use your database** to view and manage the claimed database in your workspace.

When you claim a database:

- It's moved into your Prisma Data Platform account workspace.
- It's no longer auto-deleted after 24 hours.
- You can continue using it as a permanent database instance.
