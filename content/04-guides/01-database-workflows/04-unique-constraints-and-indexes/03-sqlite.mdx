## Overview

This page explains how to configure a unique [constraint](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#uniqueconst) / [index](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createindex.html#uniqueidx) in your SQLite database. Constraints and indexes are very similar in SQLite: When adding a unique constraint to one or more columns, SQLite will always create a corresponding unique index.

In this guide, you'll always configure unique constraints (which will automatically configure unique indexes as well).

Since [SQLite does not support `ALTER TABLE` statements with the `ADD CONSTRAINT` operation](https://www.sqlite.org/omitted.html), constraints can only be added when you create the table initially (using `CREATE TABLE`). You can configure unique constraints either on a **single column** or on **multiple columns**. This guide covers both of the supported combinations.

At the end of the guide, you'll introspect your database to reflect the unique constraint in the Prisma schema, then you'll generate Prisma Client and write a simple Node.js script to validate the constraints.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this guide, you need:

- the [`sqlite3`](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html) command line client for SQLite
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine

## 1. Create a new database and project directory

Start by creating a project directory where you can put the files you'll create throughout this guide:

```
mkdir unique-demo
cd unique-demo
```

Afterwards, execute the following command in your terminal to create a new database called `UniqueDemo`:

```
sqlite3 UniqueDemo.db
```

You can validate that the database was created by running the `.tables` command which lists all tables (_relations_) in your database (right now there are none):

```
sqlite3 UniqueDemo.db '.tables'
```

## 2. Create a table with a single-column unique constraint and index

In this section, you'll **create a new table with a single-column unique constraint** in the `UniqueDemo` database. As mentioned above, this means that SQLite automatically adds a unique index to the same column.

Create a new file called `single-column-unique.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "User" (
  "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  "email" TEXT UNIQUE
);
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create a new table called `User`:

```
sqlite3 UniqueDemo.db < single-column-unique.sql
```

Congratulations, you just created a table called `User` in the database. The table has an `id` column and a column called `email` on which you defined a unique index. SQLite also automatically added a corresponding unique index (do **not** run this code):

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "sqlite_autoindex_User_1" ON "User"("email");
```

<details><summary>Alternative: Define the constraint as a <strong>table constraint</strong></summary>
<br />

In the code above, you created the unique constraint as a **column constraint**. Alternatively, you can define it as a **table constraint**. There's no practical difference between the two, the alternative is just added for completeness.

To add the unique constraint as a table constraint, you need to adjust your SQL statement to look as follows:


```sql
CREATE TABLE "User" (
  "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  "email" TEXT,
  UNIQUE ("email")
);
```

</details> 

## 3. Create a table with a multi-column unique constraint and index

Next, you'll **create a table with a multi-column unique constraint**. This also adds a unique index to the columns with the constraint.

Create a new file called `multi-column-unique.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "AnotherUser" (
  "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  "firstName" TEXT,
  "lastName" TEXT,
  UNIQUE ("firstName", "lastName")
);
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create a new table called `AnotherUser`:

```
sqlite3 UniqueDemo.db < multi-column-unique.sql
```

Congratulations, you just created a table called `AnotherUser` in the database. The table has an `id` column and two column called `firstName` and `lastName` on which you defined a unique index. SQLite also automatically added a corresponding unique index (do **not** run this code):

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "sqlite_autoindex_AnotherUser_1" ON "AnotherUser"("firstName", "lastName");
```

## 4. Introspect your database with Prisma

In the previous sections, you created two tables with unique constraints:

- The table `User` has a singe-column unique constraint and index on the `email` column
- The table `AnotherUser` has a multi-column unique constraint and index on the `firstName` and `lastName` columns

In this section you'll introspect your database to generate the Prisma models for these tables.

To start, set up a new Node.js project and add the `prisma2` CLI as a development dependency:

```
npm init -y
npm install prisma2 --save-dev
```

In order to introspect your database, you need to tell Prisma how to connect to it. You do so by configuring a `datasource` in your Prisma schema.

Create a new file called `schema.prisma` and add the following code to it:

```prisma
datasource sqlite {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The database connection URL is set via an environment variable. The Prisma CLI automatically supports the [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) format which automatically picks up environment variables defined in a file called `.env`.

Create a new file called `.env` and set your database connection URL as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:UniqueDemo.db
```

With both the `schema.prisma` and `.env` files in place, you can run Prisma's introspection with the following command:

```
npx prisma introspect
```

This command introspects your database and for each table adds a Prisma model to the Prisma schema:

```prisma
datasource sqlite {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  email String? @unique
  id    Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
}

model AnotherUser {
  firstName String?
  id        Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  lastName  String?

  @@unique([firstName, lastName], name: "sqlite_autoindex_AnotherUser_1")
}
```

## 5. Generate Prisma Client

To validate whether the unique constraints work, you'll now generate Prisma Client and send a few sample queries to the database.

First, add a `generator` block to your Prisma schema (typically added right below the `datasource` block):

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

Run the following command to install and generate Prisma Client in your project:

```
npx prisma generate
```

Now you can use Prisma Client to send database queries in Node.js.

## 6. Validate the unique constraints in a Node.js script

Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code to it:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const newUser1 = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    },
  });
  console.log(newUser1);
  const newUser2 = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    },
  });
  console.log(newUser2);
}

main();
```

In this code, you're creating two users with the same `email`, so you're violating the unique constraint that's configured on the `User` table.

Run the code with this command:

```
node index.js
```

After `newUser1` gets printed to the console succesfully, the script throws an error indicating that the unique constraint on `email` is violated:

```
{ email: 'alice@prisma.io', id: 1 }
(node:14072) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error:
Invalid `newUser2 = await prisma.user.create()` invocation in
/Users/janedoe/unique-demo/index.js:12:38

   8     email: "alice@prisma.io"
   9   }
  10 })
  11 console.log(newUser1)
→ 12 const newUser2 = await prisma.user.create(Unique constraint failed on the fields: (`email`)
```

To validate the multi-column unique constraint, replace the code in `index.js` with the following:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const newUser1 = await prisma.anotherUser.create({
    data: {
      firstName: 'Alice',
      lastName: 'Smith',
    },
  });
  console.log(newUser1);
  const newUser2 = await prisma.anotherUser.create({
    data: {
      firstName: 'Alice',
      lastName: 'Smith',
    },
  });
  console.log(newUser2);
}

main();
```

Run the script again with this command:

```
node index.js
```

This time, you'll see a similar error message indicating the unique constraint on `firstName` and `lastName` was violated:

```
{ firstName: 'Alice', id: 1, lastName: 'Smith' }
(node:14273) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error:
Invalid `newUser2 = await prisma.anotherUser.create()` invocation in
/Users/janedoe/unique-demo/index.js:13:45

   9     lastName: "Smith"
  10   }
  11 })
  12 console.log(newUser1)
→ 13 const newUser2 = await prisma.anotherUser.create(Unique constraint failed on the fields: (`firstName`,`lastName`)
```

Note that you can add `NULL` values for these columns without violating the constraints. For example, the following code snippet will **not** fail:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const newUser1 = await prisma.user.create({ data: {} });
  console.log(newUser1);
  const newUser2 = await prisma.user.create({ data: {} });
  console.log(newUser2);
}

main();
```

It will create two new records where the `email` is set to `NULL` in the database.
