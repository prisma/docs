## Overview

This page explains how to configure [foreign key constraints](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html) in your MySQL database. Foreign keys are used to represent _relations_ in your database.

In this guide, you'll create two tables where one references the other via a foreign key. Foreign keys can be defined on a **single column** or on **multiple columns**. This guide covers both approaches.

At the end of the guide, you'll introspect your database to reflect the foreign key in the Prisma schema, then you'll generate Prisma Client and write a simple Node.js script to test the foreign key relation.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this guide, you need:

- a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database server running
- the [`mysql`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql.html) command line client for MySQL
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine

## 1. Create a new database and project directory

Start by creating a project directory where you can put the files you'll create throughout this guide:

```
mkdir foreign-key-demo
cd foreign-key-demo
```

Next, make sure that your MySQL database server is running. Then execute the following command in your terminal to create a new database called `ForeignKeyDemo`:

```
mysql -e 'CREATE DATABASE `ForeignKeyDemo`;'
```

You can validate that the database was created by running the `SHOW TABLES` command which lists all tables (_relations_) in your database (right now there are none):

```
mysql -e 'SHOW TABLES in `ForeignKeyDemo`;'
```

## 2. Create two tables with a single-column foreign key constraint

In this section, you'll **create two tables where one references the other via a single-column foreign key** in the `ForeignKeyDemo` database.

Create a new file called `single-column-foreign-key.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `ForeignKeyDemo`.`User` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `name` VARCHAR(256)
);

CREATE TABLE `ForeignKeyDemo`.`Post` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `title` VARCHAR(256),
  `authorId` INT,
  CONSTRAINT `author` FOREIGN KEY (`authorId`) REFERENCES `User`(`id`)
);
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create the two tables:

```
mysql < single-column-foreign-key.sql
```

Congratulations, you just created two tables called `User` and `Post` in the database. The `Post` table references the `User` table via the foreign key defined on the `authorId` column.

## 3. Create a table with a multi-column foreign key constraint

In this section, you'll **create two tables where one references the other via a single-column foreign key** in the `ForeignKeyDemo` database.

Create a new file called `multi-column-foreign-key.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `ForeignKeyDemo`.`AnotherUser` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `firstName` VARCHAR(256),
  `lastName` VARCHAR(256),
  UNIQUE (`firstName`, `lastName`)
);

CREATE TABLE `ForeignKeyDemo`.`AnotherPost` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `title` TEXT,
  `authorFirstName` VARCHAR(256),
  `authorLastName` VARCHAR(256),
  FOREIGN KEY (`authorFirstName`, `authorLastName`) REFERENCES `AnotherUser`(`firstName`, `lastName`)
);
```

> **Note**: The `UNIQUE` constraint on `AnotherUser` is needed to be able to reference the columns as foreign keys.

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create a new table called `AnotherUser`:

```
mysql < multi-column-foreign-key.sql
```

Congratulations, you just created two tables called `AnotherUser` and `AnotherPost` in the database. The `AnotherPost` table references the `AnotherUser` table via the foreign key defined on the `authorFirstName` and `authorLastName` columns.

## 4. Introspect your database with Prisma

In the previous sections, you created two different foreign key constraints using four total tables:

- The table `Post` has a singe-column foreign key on it's `authorId` column which points to the `id` field of the `User` table.
- The table `AnotherPost` has a multi-column foreign key on it's `authorFirstName` and `authorLastName` columns which point to the `firstName` and `lastField` columns of the `AnotherUser` table.

In this section you'll introspect your database to generate the Prisma models for these tables.

To start, set up a new Node.js project and add the `prisma2` CLI as a development dependency:

```
npm init -y
npm install prisma2 --save-dev
```

In order to introspect your database, you need to tell Prisma how to connect to it. You do so by configuring a `datasource` in your Prisma schema.

Create a new file called `schema.prisma` and add the following code to it:

```prisma
datasource mysql {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The database connection URL is set via an environment variable. The Prisma CLI automatically supports the [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) format which automatically picks up environment variables defined in a file called `.env`.

Create a new file called `.env` and set your database connection URL as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__:__PORT__/ForeignKeyDemo
```

In the above code snippet, you need to replace the uppercase placeholders with your own connection details. For example, if your database is running locally it could look like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/ForeignKeyDemo
```

With both the `schema.prisma` and `.env` files in place, you can run Prisma's introspection with the following command:

```
npx prisma introspect
```

This command introspects your database and for each table adds a Prisma model to the Prisma schema:

```prisma
datasource mysql {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model AnotherPost {
  authorFirstName String?
  authorLastName  String?
  id              Int          @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title           String?
  AnotherUser     AnotherUser? @relation(fields: [authorFirstName, authorLastName], references: [firstName, lastName])

  @@index([authorFirstName, authorLastName], name: "authorFirstName")
}

model AnotherUser {
  firstName   String?
  id          Int           @default(autoincrement()) @id
  lastName    String?
  AnotherPost AnotherPost[]

  @@unique([firstName, lastName], name: "firstName")
}

model Post {
  authorId Int?
  id       Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title    String?
  User     User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])

  @@index([authorId], name: "author")
}

model User {
  id   Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name String?
  Post Post[]
}
```

## 5. Generate Prisma Client

To validate whether the foreign key constraints work, you'll now generate Prisma Client and send a few sample queries to the database to test the relations.

First, add a `generator` block to your Prisma schema (typically added right below the `datasource` block):

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

Run the following command to install and generate Prisma Client in your project:

```
npx prisma generate
```

Now you can use Prisma Client to send database queries in Node.js.

## 6. Validate the foreign key constraints in a Node.js script

Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code to it:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const userWithPost = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Alice',
      Post: {
        create: {
          title: 'Hello World from Alice',
        },
      },
    },
    include: {
      Post: true,
    },
  });
  console.log(userWithPost);

  const anotherUserWithPost = await prisma.anotherUser.create({
    data: {
      firstName: 'Bob',
      lastName: 'Smith',
      AnotherPost: {
        create: {
          title: 'Hello World from Bob',
        },
      },
    },
    include: {
      AnotherPost: true,
    },
  });
  console.log(anotherUserWithPost);
}

main();
```

In this code, you're creating two `User` records, each with a related `Post` record.

Run the code with this command:

```
node index.js
```

The following output indicates that the foreign key constraint is working as intended:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Alice',
  Post: [ { authorId: 1, id: 1, title: 'Hello World from Alice' } ]
}
{
  firstName: 'Bob',
  id: 1,
  lastName: 'Smith',
  AnotherPost: [
    {
      authorFirstName: 'Bob',
      authorLastName: 'Smith',
      id: 1,
      title: 'Hello World from Bob'
    }
  ]
}
```
