## Overview

A foreign key links data in one table to data in another table. For example, records in a `Posts` table might have a foreign key named `authorId` that refers to the `id` column of the `User` table. This relationship makes it possible to, for example, find all blog posts by a particular author.

The Prisma schema represents tables as models, and connections between two models are called [relations](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations). You can [filter and query by relations](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/relation-queries) - for example, you can get all posts where the author's email address contains _"prisma.io"_.

This section describes how to configure foreign key relationships for different databases. When you introspect a database, these relationships are represented in the Prisma schema as **relations**.
