## Overview

This page explains how to configure cascading deletes on [foreign key constraints](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html) (relations) in your MySQL database.

Cascading deletes allow you to configure deletion behavior on relations (e.g. specify a rule like "when a user is deleted, all their posts should be automatically deleted too"). The database will then enforce this behavior when records are deleted.

There generally are five options for configuring deletion behavior in MySQL (paraphrasing from the [MySQL docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html#foreign-key-referential-actions)):

- `RESTRICT` (default): Prevents deleting the parent table if a child table references it.
- `NO ACTION`: Same as `RESTRICT` in MySQL
- `CASCADE`: When a row is deleted in the parent table, row(s) referencing it should be automatically deleted as well.
- `SET NULL`: Causes the referencing columns to be set to `NULL` when the referenced row is deleted.
- `SET DEFAULT`: Causes the referencing columns to be set to their default values when the referenced row is deleted. While this is recognized by MySQL, [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-storage-engine.html) (the most common MySQL database engine) and [NDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster.html) do not allow the `SET DEFAULT` action.

In this guide, you'll create two tables where one references the other via a foreign key and explore the different options for cascading deletes.

At the end of the guide, you'll introspect your database to reflect the foreign key in the Prisma schema, then you'll generate Prisma Client and write a simple Node.js script to test the deletion behaviors.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this guide, you need:

- a [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqld.html) database server running
- the [`mysql`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql.html) command line client for MySQL
- the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runtime for JavaScript installed on your machine

## 1. Create a new database and project directory

Start by creating a project directory where you can put the files you'll create throughout this guide:

```
mkdir cascading-deletes-demo
cd cascading-deletes-demo
```

Next, make sure that your MySQL database server is running. Then execute the following command in your terminal to create a new database called `CascadingDeletesDemo`:

```
mysql -e 'CREATE DATABASE `CascadingDeletesDemo`'
```

You can validate that the database was created by running the `SHOW TABLES` command which lists all tables (_relations_) in your database (right now there are none):

```
mysql -e 'SHOW TABLES in `CascadingDeletesDemo`;'
```

## 2. Create two tables with a foreign key and `RESTRICT` deletion behavior

In this section, you'll **create two tables where one references the other via a foreign key with the `RESTRICT` action** in the `CascadingDeletesDemo` database.

Create a new file called `cascading-deletes-restrict.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`User` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `name` VARCHAR(256)
);

CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`Post` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `title` VARCHAR(256),
  `author` INT,
  CONSTRAINT `author` FOREIGN KEY (`author`) REFERENCES `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`User`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT
);
```

Note that because `RESTRICT` is the default, you could also omit it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`Post` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `title` VARCHAR(256),
  `authorId` INT,
  CONSTRAINT `author` FOREIGN KEY (`authorId`) REFERENCES `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`User`(`id`)
);
```

Alternatively, you could also use `NO ACTION` since `RESTRICT` and `NO ACTION` are identical in MySQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`Post` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `title` VARCHAR(256),
  `authorId` INT,
  CONSTRAINT `author` FOREIGN KEY (`authorId`) REFERENCES `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`User`(`id`) ON DELETE NO ACTION
);
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create the two tables:

```
mysql < cascading-deletes-restrict.sql
```

Congratulations, you just created two tables called `User` and `Post` in the database. The `Post` table references the `User` table via the foreign key defined on the `authorId` column.

The deletion action `RESTRICT` in this case means that it is not possible to delete a `User` record that is referenced by a `Post` record. If you try doing that, the database will throw an error similar to this:

```
update or delete on table "User" violates foreign key constraint "Post_author_fkey" on table "Post"
Detail: Key (id)=(1) is still referenced from table "Post".
```

<details><summary>Alternative: Define the constraint as a <strong>column constraint</strong></summary>
<br />

In the code above, you created the unique constraint as a **table constraint**. Alternatively, you can define it as a **column constraint**. There's no practical difference between the two, the alternative is just added for completeness.

To add the foreign key constraint as a column constraint, you need to adjust your SQL statement for creating the `Post` table to look as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`Post` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `title` VARCHAR(256),
  `author` INT REFERENCES `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`User`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT
);
```

</details> 

## 3. Create two tables with a foreign key and `CASCADE` deletion action

In this section, you'll **create two tables where one references the other via a foreign key with the `CASCADE` action** in the `CascadingDeletesDemo` database.

Create a new file called `cascading-deletes-cascade.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`AnotherUser` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `name` VARCHAR(256)
);

CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`AnotherPost` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `title` VARCHAR(256),
  `authorId` INT,
  CONSTRAINT `author` FOREIGN KEY (`authorId`) REFERENCES `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`AnotherUser` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create the two tables:

```
mysql < cascading-deletes-cascade.sql
```

Congratulations, you just created two tables called `AnotherUser` and `AnotherPost` in the database. The `AnotherPost` table references the `AnotherUser` table via the foreign key defined on the `authorId` column.

The deletion action `CASCADE` in this case means that when you delete a `AnotherUser` record that's referenced by one or more `AnotherPost` records, these `AnotherPost` records will be deleted as well.

## 4. Create two tables with a foreign key and `SET NULL` deletion behavior

In this section, you'll **create two tables where one references the other via a foreign key with the `SET NULL` action** in the `CascadingDeletesDemo` database.

Create a new file called `cascading-deletes-set-null.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`AlmostTheLastUser` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `name` VARCHAR(256)
);

CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`AlmostTheLastPost` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `title` VARCHAR(256),
  `authorId` INT,
  CONSTRAINT `author` FOREIGN KEY (`authorId`) REFERENCES `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`AlmostTheLastUser`(`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create the two tables:

```
mysql < cascading-deletes-set-null.sql
```

Congratulations, you just created two tables called `AlmostTheLastUser` and `AlmostTheLastPost` in the database. The `AlmostTheLastPost` table references the `AlmostTheLastUser` table via the foreign key defined on the `authorId` column.

The deletion behavior `SET NULL` in this case means that when you delete an `AlmostTheLastUser` record that's referenced by one or more `AlmostTheLastPost` records, the `authorId` column on these `AlmostTheLastPost` records will be set to `NULL` (therefore maintaining the integrity of the data and ensuring that no `AlmostTheLastPost` records point to non-existing `AlmostTheLastUser` records).

## 5. Create two tables with a foreign key and `SET DEFAULT` deletion behavior

In this section, you'll **create two tables where one references the other via a foreign key with the `SET DEFAULT` action** in the `CascadingDeletesDemo` database. Remember, InnoDB, the most common MySQL database engine does not allow the `SET DEFAULT`. We'll show this example for use with other database types, but delete the tables once we're done to clean our example up.

Create a new file called `cascading-deletes-set-default.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`TheLastUser` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `name` VARCHAR(256)
);

CREATE TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`TheLastPost` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `title` VARCHAR(256),
  `authorId` INT DEFAULT 42,
  CONSTRAINT `author` FOREIGN KEY (`authorId`) REFERENCES `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`TheLastUser` (`id`) ON DELETE SET DEFAULT
);
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to try to create the two tables:

```
mysql < cascading-deletes-set-default.sql
```

MySQL will raise the following error because InnoDB does not allow the `SET DEFAULT` action:

```
ERROR 1215 (HY000) at line 6: Cannot add foreign key constraint
```

When used on tables using a different database engine, the `TheLastPost` table would reference the `TheLastUser` table via the foreign key defined on the `authorId` column.

If you were using a different database engine, the deletion behavior `SET DEFAULT` would mean that when you delete a `TheLastUser` record that's referenced by one or more `TheLastPost` records, the `authorId` column on these `TheLastPost` records would be set to the _default_ value of the column.

If no default exists, it would be set to `NULL` (in that case, the behavior would be identical to `SET NULL`). In the above table, a contrived example with a default value of `42` is used. If no `TheLastUser` record with an `id` value of `42` exists though, the operation would fail with a message similar to this:

```
insert or update on table "TheLastPost" violates foreign key constraint "TheLastPost_author_fkey"
Detail: Key (authorId)=(42) is not present in table "TheLastUser".
```

Since `TheLastPost` records would only ever reference existing `TheLastUser` records, `SET NULL` also maintains the integrity of the data and ensures that no `TheLastPost` records can point to non-existing `TheLastUser` records.

Since you were not able to create a `TheLastPost` table with the `SET DEFAULT` constraint, you can clean up the `TheLastUser` table:

```
mysql -e 'DROP TABLE `CascadingDeletesDemo`.`TheLastUser`;'
```

## 6. Introspect your database with Prisma

In the previous sections, you created two tables with foreign key constraints for each of the following three scenarios:

- The table `Post` uses `RESTRICT` action on the foreign key column `authorId` which points to the `User` table. This is identical to the default behavior and the `NO ACTION` behavior.
- The table `AnotherPost` uses `CASCADE` action on the foreign key column `authorId` which points to the `AnotherUser` table.
- The table `AlmostTheLastPost` uses `SET NULL` action on the foreign key column `authorId` which points to the `AlmostTheLastUser` table

In addition to the above behavior, you also confirmed that the default database engine (InnoDB) does not allow for the `SET DEFAULT` action on delete. The relationship between the following tables was not allowed:

- The table `TheLastPost` used the `SET DEFAULT` action on the foreign key column `authorId` which pointed to the `TheLastUser` table

In this section you'll introspect your database to generate the Prisma models for these tables.

To start, set up a new Node.js project and add the `prisma2` CLI as a development dependency:

```
npm init -y
npm install prisma2 --save-dev
```

In order to introspect your database, you need to tell Prisma how to connect to it. You do so by configuring a `datasource` in your Prisma schema.

Create a new file called `schema.prisma` and add the following code to it:

```prisma
datasource mysql {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The database connection URL is set via an environment variable. The Prisma CLI automatically supports the [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) format which automatically picks up environment variables defined in a file called `.env`.

Create a new file called `.env` and set your database connection URL as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__:__PORT__/CascadingDeletesDemo
```

In the above code snippet, you need to replace the uppercase placeholders with your own connection details. For example, if your database is running locally it could look like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/CascadingDeletesDemo
```

With both the `schema.prisma` and `.env` files in place, you can run Prisma's introspection with the following command:

```
npx prisma introspect
```

This command introspects your database and for each table adds a Prisma model to the Prisma schema:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model AlmostTheLastPost {
  authorId          Int?
  id                Int                @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title             String?
  AlmostTheLastUser AlmostTheLastUser? @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])

  @@index([authorId], name: "author4")
}

model AlmostTheLastUser {
  id                Int                 @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name              String?
  AlmostTheLastPost AlmostTheLastPost[]
}

model AnotherPost {
  authorId    Int?
  id          Int          @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title       String?
  AnotherUser AnotherUser? @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])

  @@index([authorId], name: "author")
}

model AnotherUser {
  id          Int           @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name        String?
  AnotherPost AnotherPost[]
}

model Post {
  author Int?
  id     Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title  String?
  User   User?   @relation(fields: [author], references: [id])

  @@index([author], name: "author2")
}

model User {
  id   Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name String?
  Post Post[]
}
```

> **Note**: Deletion behaviors for relations are not yet supported in the Prisma schema so you don't see them anywhere. The behavior will still be enforced by the database though since that's where you configured it.

## 7. Generate Prisma Client

To validate whether the foreign key constraints work, you'll now generate Prisma Client and send a few sample queries to the database to test the relations.

First, add a `generator` block to your Prisma schema (typically added right below the `datasource` block):

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

Run the following command to install and generate Prisma Client in your project:

```
npx prisma generate
```

Now you can use Prisma Client to send database queries in Node.js.

## 8. Validate the deletion behavior in a Node.js script

### 8.1. Validating `RESTRICT`

The `RESTRICT` keyword prevents deletion of a referenced row. So, when trying to delete a `User` record that is reference by a `Post` record, the query will fail.

To test the `RESTRICT` behavior, you need to access the `User` and `Post` tables.

Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code to it:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const userWithPost = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Alice',
      Post: {
        create: { title: 'Hello World' },
      },
    },
  });

  try {
    const deletedUser = await prisma.user.delete({
      where: { id: userWithPost.id },
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
}

main();
```

Run the code with this command:

```
node index.js
```

The script will throw an exception when invoking `prisma.user.delete(...)`. The error will look similar to this:

```
PrismaClientUnknownRequestError:
Invalid `const deletedUser = await prisma.user.delete()` invocation in
/Users/janedoe/cascasing-deletes-demo/index.js:16:49

  12   },
  13 });
  14
  15 try {
→ 16   const deletedUser = await prisma.user.delete(

Error occurred during query execution:
ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: ForeignKeyConstraintViolation { constraint: Fields(["authorId"]) } })
    at PrismaClientFetcher.request (/Users/janedoe/cascasing-deletes-demo/mysql/node_modules/@prisma/client/runtime/index.js:1:51487)
    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:85:5)
```

### 8.2. Validating `CASCADE`

The `CASCADE` keyword ensures that when a referenced row is deleted, all the rows that are referencing it get deleted as well. So, when trying to delete an `AnotherUser` record that is referenced by one or more `AnotherPost` records, these `AnotherPost` records will be deleted too.

To test the `CASCADE` behavior, you need to access the `AnotherUser` and `AnotherPost` tables.

Open the `index.js` file and replace its contents with the following code:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const userWithPost = await prisma.anotherUser.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Alice',
      AnotherPost: {
        create: { title: 'Hello World' },
      },
    },
  });

  const allUsers1 = await prisma.anotherUser.findMany();
  const allPosts1 = await prisma.anotherPost.findMany();

  console.log(
    `Before deleting the \`AnotherUser\` record there are ${allUsers1.length} users and ${allPosts1.length} posts.`
  );

  const deletedUser = await prisma.anotherUser.delete({
    where: { id: userWithPost.id },
  });

  const allUsers2 = await prisma.anotherUser.findMany();
  const allPosts2 = await prisma.anotherPost.findMany();

  console.log(
    `After deleting the \`AnotherUser\` record there are ${allUsers2.length} users and ${allPosts2.length} posts.`
  );
}

main();
```

Run the code with this command:

```
node index.js
```

The console output will look similar to this:

```
Before deleting the `AnotherUser` record there are 1 users and 1 posts.
After deleting the `AnotherUser` record there are 0 users and 0 posts.
```

### 8.3. Validating `SET NULL`

The `SET NULL` keyword ensures that when a referenced row is deleted, all the rows that are referencing it reset their foreign key to `NULL`. So, when deleting an `AlmostTheLastUser` record that is referenced by one or more `AlmostTheLastPost` records, these `AlmostTheLastPost` records will reset their `authorId` fields to `NULL`.

To test the `SET NULL` behavior, you need to access the `AlmostTheLastUser` and `AlmostTheLastPost` tables.

Open the `index.js` file and replace its contents with the following code:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const userWithPost = await prisma.almostTheLastUser.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Alice',
      AlmostTheLastPost: {
        create: { title: 'Hello World' },
      },
    },
    include: {
      AlmostTheLastPost: true,
    },
  });

  const postBefore = await prisma.almostTheLastPost.findOne({
    where: { id: userWithPost.AlmostTheLastPost[0].id },
    include: { AlmostTheLastUser: true },
  });

  console.log(
    `Before deleting the \`AlmostTheLastUser\` record, the \`AlmostTheLastPost\` record looks as follows:\n${JSON.stringify(
      postBefore
    )}`
  );

  const deletedUser = await prisma.almostTheLastUser.delete({
    where: { id: userWithPost.id },
  });

  const postAfter = await prisma.almostTheLastPost.findOne({
    where: { id: postBefore.id },
    include: { AlmostTheLastUser: true },
  });

  console.log(
    `After deleting the \`AlmostTheLastUser\` record, the \`AlmostTheLastPost\` record looks as follows:\n${JSON.stringify(
      postAfter
    )}`
  );
}

main();
```

Run the code with this command:

```
node index.js
```

The console output will look similar to this:

```
Before deleting the `AlmostTheLastUser` record, the `AlmostTheLastPost` record looks as follows:
{"authorId":1,"id":1,"title":"Hello World","AlmostTheLastUser":{"id":1,"name":"Alice"}}
After deleting the `AlmostTheLastUser` record, the `AlmostTheLastPost` record looks as follows:
{"authorId":null,"id":1,"title":"Hello World","AlmostTheLastUser":null}
```
