## Overview

This page explains how to configure [check constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS) in a PostgreSQL database. A check constraint is a condition that must be satisfied before a value can be saved to a table - for example, the discounted price of a product must always be less than the original price.

Check constraints can be added when you create the table (using `CREATE TABLE`) or to a table that already exists (using `ALTER TABLE`). This guide covers all four combinations.

At the end of the guide, you'll introspect your database, generate a Prisma Client, and write a simple Node.js script to validate the constraints.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this guide, you need:

- a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server running
- the [`createdb`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/app-createdb.html) command line utility
- the [`psql`]() command line client for PostgreSQL
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine

## 1. Create a new database and project directory

Start by creating a project directory for the files that you'll create throughout this guide. Open terminal or command line and run the following commands:

```
mkdir check-demo
cd check-demo
```

Next, make sure that your PostgreSQL database server is running. Authenticate the default `postgres` user:

Unix (bash):

```
sudo -u postgres
```

Windows (command line):

```
psql -U postgres
```

Then execute the following command in your terminal to create a new database called `CheckDemo`:

Unix (bash):

```
createdb CheckDemo
```

Windows (command line):

```
create database CheckDemo;
\connect CheckDemo
```

> _Tip_: Remember the trailing `;`! `postgres=#` `postgres-#`

You can validate that the database was created by running the `\dt` command which lists all tables (_relations_) in your database (right now there are none):

Unix (bash):

```
psql -d CheckDemo -c "\dt"
```

Windows (command line):

```
-d CheckDemo -c \dt
```

## 2. Adding a table with a single check constraint on a single column

In this section, you'll **create a new table with a single check constraint on a single column** in the `CheckDemo` database.

Create a new file called `single-column-check-constraint.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."product" (
  price NUMERIC CONSTRAINT price_value_check CHECK (price > 0.01 AND price <> 1240.00)
);
ALTER TABLE "public"."product"
  ADD COLUMN "productid" serial,
  ADD PRIMARY KEY ("productid");
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create a new table called `product`:

Unix (bash):

```
psql CheckDemo < single-column-check-constraint.sql
```

Windows (command line):

```
\i 'c:/checkdemo/single-column-check-constraint.sql'
```

Congratulations, you just created a table called `product` in the database. The table has one column called `price`, which has a single check constraint that ensures price of a product is:

- Never less than 0.01
- Never equal to 1240.00

Run the following command to see the a list of check constraints that apply to the `product` table:

```
\d+ product
```

You will see the following output, which includes a list of all check constraints:

```
Table "public.product"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage | Stats target | Description
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------+---------+--------------+-------------
 price  | numeric |           |          |         | main    |              |
Check constraints:
    "price_value_check" CHECK (price > 0.01 AND price <> 1240.00)
```

Note that PostgreSQL will auto-generate a constraint name if you do not provide one. For example, the constraint created by `price NUMERIC CHECK (price > 0.01 AND price <> 1240.00)` would be `price_check`.

## 3. Adding a table with a multi-column check constraint

Next, you'll **create a table with a multi-column check constraint** that compares the values of two columns.

Create a new file called `multi-column-check-constraint.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."anotherproduct" (
  reducedprice NUMERIC CONSTRAINT reduced_price_check CHECK (price > reducedprice),
  price NUMERIC
);
ALTER TABLE "public"."anotherproduct"
  ADD COLUMN "productid" serial,
  ADD PRIMARY KEY ("productid");
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create a new table called `anotherproduct`:

Unix (bash):

```
psql CheckDemo < multi-column-check-constraint.sql
```

Windows (command line):

```
\i 'c:/checkdemo/multi-column-check-constraint.sql'
```

Congratulations, you just created a table called `anotherproduct` in the database. The table has two columns called `reducedprice` and `price`. The `reducedprice` column has a check constraint that ensures that the value of `reducedprice` is always less than the value of `price`.

## 4. Adding a table with multiple check constraints

Next, you'll **create a table with multiple check constraint** on different columns.

Create a new file called `multiple-check-constraints.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
  CREATE TABLE "public"."secondtolastproduct" (
    reducedprice NUMERIC CONSTRAINT reduced_price_check CHECK (price > reducedprice),
    price NUMERIC,
    tags TEXT[] CONSTRAINT tags_contains_product CHECK ('product' = ANY(tags))
  );
ALTER TABLE "public"."secondtolastproduct"
  ADD COLUMN "productid" serial,
  ADD PRIMARY KEY ("productid");
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create a new table called `secondtolastproduct`:

Unix (bash):

```
psql CheckDemo < multiple-check-constraints.sql
```

Windows (command line):

```
\i 'c:/checkdemo/multiple-check-constraints.sql'
```

Congratulations, you just created a table called `lastproduct` in the database. The table has three colums named `reducedprice`, `price` and `tags`, and the following check constraints:

- The `tags` column (which is an array) must contain a tag named `product`
- The value of `reducedprice` must be less than the value of `price`

## 5. Adding a check constraint to an existing table

In this section, you'll **add a check constraint to a table that already exists in your database**. To do so, you first need to create a new table and then alter the table to add the constraint.

Create a new file called `add-single-check-constraint-later.sql` and add the following code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."lastproduct" (
  category TEXT
);

ALTER TABLE "public"."lastproduct"
  ADD CONSTRAINT "category_not_clothing" CHECK (category <> 'clothing');
```

This code contains two SQL statements:

1. Create a new table called `lastproduct`
2. Alter the table to add a check constraint named `price_not_zero_constraint`

Now run the SQL statements against your database to create a new table called `lastproduct`:

Unix (bash):

```
psql CheckDemo < add-single-check-constraint-later.sql
```

Windows (command line):

```
\i 'c:/checkdemo/add-single-check-constraint-later.sql'
```

Congratulations, you just created a table called `lastproduct` in the database with a single column called `price`. You added constraint named `price_not_zero_constraint` to with a second SQL command, which ensures that the price of a product is never less than 0.01.

## 6. Introspect your database with Prisma

In the previous sections, you created four tables with different check constraints:

- The `product` table has a check constraint that ensures that the value of `price` is never less than `0.01` and enver exactly `1240.00`.
- The `anotherproduct` table has a check constraint that ensures that the value of `reducedprice` is never greater than the value of `price`.
- The `secondtolastproduct` table has two check constraints - one that ensures that the value of `reducedprice` is never greater than the value of `price`, and one that ensures that the `tags` array always contains the value `product`.
- The `lastproduct` table has a check constraint that ensures that the value of `category` is never `clothing`.

In this section you'll introspect your database to generate the Prisma models for these tables.

> **Note**: Check constraints are currently not included in the generated Prisma schema - however, the underlying database still enforces the constraints.

To start, set up a new Node.js project and add the `prisma2` CLI as a development dependency:

```
npm init -y
npm install prisma2 --save-dev
```

In order to introspect your database, you need to tell Prisma how to connect to it. You do so by configuring a `datasource` in your Prisma schema.

Create a new file called `schema.prisma` and add the following code to it:

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The database connection URL is set via an environment variable. The Prisma CLI automatically supports the [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) format which automatically picks up environment variables defined in a file called `.env`.

Create a new file called `.env` and set your database connection URL as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__:__PORT__/CheckDemo
```

In the above code snippet, you need to replace the uppercase placeholders with your own connection details. For example, if your database is running locally it could look like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/CheckDemo
```

With both the `schema.prisma` and `.env` files in place, you can run Prisma's introspection with the following command:

```
npx prisma introspect
```

This command introspects your database and for each table adds a Prisma model to the Prisma schema:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model anotherproduct {
  price        Float?
  productid    Int    @id
  reducedprice Float?
}

model lastproduct {
  category  String?
  productid Int     @id
}

model product {
  price     Float?
  productid Int    @id
}

model secondtolastproduct {
  price        Float?
  productid    Int      @id
  reducedprice Float?
  tags         String[]
}
```

## 7. Generate Prisma Client

To validate whether the check constraints work, you'll now generate Prisma Client and send a few sample queries to the database.

First, add a `generator` block to your Prisma schema (typically added right below the `datasource` block):

```prisma
  generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
  }
```

Run the following command to install and generate Prisma Client in your project:

```
npx prisma2 generate
```

Now you can use Prisma Client to send database queries in Node.js.

## 8. Validate the check constraints in a Node.js script

Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code to it:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const newProduct = await prisma.product.create({
    data: {
      price: 0.0,
    },
  });

  console.log(newProduct);
}

main();
```

In this code, you're creating a product with a price of `0.00`, which does not meet the check constraint configured for the `price` column.

Run the code with this command:

```
node index.js
```

The script throws an error indicating that the `price_check_value` check constraint was not met:

```
Error occurred during query execution:
ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(Error { kind: Db, cause: Some(DbError { severity: "ERROR", parsed_severity: Some(Error), code: SqlState("23514"), message: "new row for relation \"product\" violates check constraint \"price_value_check\"", detail: Some("Failing row contains (0, 11)."), hint: None, position: None, where_: None, schema: Some("public"), table: Some("product"), column: None, datatype: None, constraint: Some("price_value_check"), file: Some("d:\\pginstaller_12.auto\\postgres.windows-x64\\src\\backend\\executor\\execmain.c"), line: Some(2023), routine: Some("ExecConstraints") }) }) })
```

To validate the multi-column check constraint, replace the code in `index.js` with the following:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const newProduct = await prisma.anotherproduct.create({
    data: {
      price: 50.0,
      reducedprice: 100.0,
    },
  });

  console.log(newProduct);
}

main();
```

In this code, you're creating a product where the reduced price is higher than the actual price.

Run the script again with this command:

```
node index.js
```

This time, you'll see a similar error message indicating the `reduce_price_check` check constraint was not met:

```
ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(Error { kind: Db, cause: Some(DbError { severity: "ERROR", parsed_severity: Some(Error), code: SqlState("23514"), message: "new row for relation \"anotherproduct\" violates check constraint \"reduced_price_check\"", detail: Some("Failing row contains (100, 50, 1)."), hint: None, position: None, where_: None, schema: Some("public"), table: Some("anotherproduct"), column: None, datatype: None, constraint: Some("reduced_price_check"), file: Some("d:\\pginstaller_12.auto\\postgres.windows-x64\\src\\backend\\executor\\execmain.c"), line: Some(2023), routine: Some("ExecConstraints") }) }) })
    at PrismaClientFetcher.request (C:\Work\Personal\prisma-check-constraint\node_modules\@prisma\client\index.js:89:17)
```

Finally, modify the script to include multiple check constraint violations:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const newProduct = await prisma.secondtolastproduct.create({
    data: {
      tags: {
        set: ['wrongtag'],
      },
      price: 90.0,
      reducedprice: 100.0,
    },
  });

  console.log(newProduct);
}

main();
```

In this code, you're creating a product where the reduced price is higher than the actual price, and omitting the required `product` tag.

Run the script again with this command:

```
node index.js
```

Notice that the error message only mentions the `reduced_price_check` constraint:

```
ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(Error { kind: Db, cause: Some(DbError { severity: "ERROR", parsed_severity: Some(Error), code: SqlState("23514"), message: "new row for relation \"secondtolastproduct\" violates check constraint \"reduced_price_check\"", detail: Some("Failing row contains (100, 90, {wrongtag}, 7)."), hint: None, position: None, where_: None, schema: Some("public"), table: Some("secondtolastproduct"), column: None, datatype: None, constraint: Some("reduced_price_check"), file: Some("d:\\pginstaller_12.auto\\postgres.windows-x64\\src\\backend\\executor\\execmain.c"), line: Some(2023), routine: Some("ExecConstraints") }) }) })
```

Check constraints are resolved in alphabetical order, and only the first constraint to fail appears in the error message.
