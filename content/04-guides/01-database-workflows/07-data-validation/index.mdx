## Overview

All databases include a mechanism for validating input. In a SQL context, `CHECK` constraints allow you to specify a set of conditions a value must satisfy - for example, Column X should not be larger than Column Y.

> **Note**: You should not use `CHECK` constraints to check for `NULL` or enforce a foreign key relationship - there are specific constraints available for those purposes.

This section describes how to configure `CHECK` constraints for various databases.
