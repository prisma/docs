## Overview

This page explains how to create a [view](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/sql-createview.html) in your PostgreSQL database.

In this guide, you will:

- Create two tables where one references the other via a foreign key.
- Create a view named `Drafts`.
- Introspect your database to reflect the foreign key relation between the two tables in the Prisma schema.
- Manually update the Prisma schema to include the view as a model.
- Generate Prisma Client and write a simple Node.js script to read data from the view.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this guide, you need:

- a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server running
- the [`createdb`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/app-createdb.html) command line utility
- the [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/app-psql.html) command line client for PostgreSQL
- the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runtime for JavaScript installed on your machine

## Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations when using views with Prisma:

- You must _manually_ add each view as a model to the Prisma schema right now. Introspection does not add views to the schema currently.
- Views must include a unique column - such as an ID.
- The generated Prisma Client will include queries such `create`, `delete`, and `update`, even though you cannot perform these queries on a view.

## 1. Create a new database and project directory

To create a new database:

1. Create a project directory where you can put the files you'll create throughout this guide:

   ```bash-symbol
   mkdir sql-views-demo
   cd sql-views-demo
   ```

2. Next, make sure that your PostgreSQL database server is running. Then execute the following command in your terminal to create a new database called `SqlViews`:

   ```bash-symbol
   createdb SqlViews
   ```

3. Validate that the database was created by running the `\dt` command which lists all tables (_relations_) in your database (right now there are none):

   ```bash-symbol
   psql -d SqlViews -c "\dt"
   ```

## 2. Create two tables with a foreign key

In this section, you'll **create two tables where one references the other via a foreign key** in the `SqlViews` database.

1. Create a new file called `sql-views-tables.sql` and add the following code to it:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE "public"."User" (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     email TEXT UNIQUE
     name TEXT
   );

   CREATE TABLE "public"."Post" (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     title TEXT,
     content TEXT,
     published BOOLEAN,
     "authorId" INTEGER,
     CONSTRAINT author FOREIGN KEY ("authorId") REFERENCES "public"."User" (id)
   );
   ```

2. Run the SQL statement against your database to create the two tables:

   ```bash-symbol
   psql SqlViews < sql-views-tables.sql
   ```

3. Run the following command to validate that the tables were created:

   ```bash-symbol
   psql -d SqlViews -c "\dt"
   ```

You just created two tables named `User` and `Post` in the database. The `Post` table references the `User` table via the foreign key defined on the `authorId` column.

## 3. Create a view named `Draft`

In this section you will create a view named `Draft`. The `Draft` view represents a query that returns the post title and author email of all posts that have not been published. To create a view:

1. Create a new file called `sql-views-draft.sql` and add the following code to it:

   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW "Draft" AS
       SELECT "published", "title", "email", "Post"."id"
       FROM "Post", "User"
       WHERE "published" = false AND "Post"."authorId" = "User"."id";
   ```

2. Run the SQL statement against your database to create the view:

   ```bash-symbol
   psql SqlViews < sql-views-draft.sql
   ```

3. Run the following command to validate that the view was created:

   ```bash-symbol
   psql -d SqlViews -c "\dv"
   ```

   You should see the following list of views:

   ```
         List of relations
    Schema |  Name  | Type |  Owner
    --------+--------+------+----------
    public | Draft  | view | postgres
   ```

## 4. Introspect your database with Prisma

In this section you'll introspect your database to generate the Prisma models for the tables that you created.

> **Note**: You will manually add the `Draft` view to the Prisma schema in a later step.

1. Set up a new Node.js project and add the `prisma` CLI as a development dependency:

   ```bash-symbol
   npm init -y
   npm install prisma --save-dev
   ```

2. Create a new file called `schema.prisma` and add the following code to it:

   ```prisma
   datasource postgresql {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

3. In order to introspect your database, you need to tell Prisma how to connect to it. You do so by configuring a `datasource` in your Prisma schema. Create a new file called `.env` and set your database connection URL as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

   ```copy
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__:__PORT__/SqlViews
   ```

   In the above code snippet, you need to replace the uppercase placeholders with your own connection details. For example, if your database is running locally it could look like this:

   ```copy
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/SqlViews
   ```

   The database connection URL is set via an environment variable. The Prisma CLI automatically supports the [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) format which automatically picks up environment variables defined in a file called `.env`.

4. With both the `schema.prisma` and `.env` files in place, run Prisma's introspection with the following command:

   ```bash-symbol
   npx prisma introspect
   ```

   This command introspects your database and for each table adds a Prisma model to the Prisma schema:

   ```prisma
    datasource postgresql {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    model Post {
      authorId  Int?
      content   String?
      id        Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
      published Boolean @default(false)
      title     String
      User      User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    }

    model User {
      email String  @unique
      id    Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
      name  String?
      Post  Post[]
    }
   ```

## 5. Manually add the `Draft` view to the Prisma schema

You must manually add views to the Prisma schema.

1. Add a `Draft` model to the schema as shown:

   > **Note**: The name of your view is case sensitive - if you created a view named `draft` in the database, you must create a model named `draft` in the Prisma schema.

   ```prisma
   datasource postgresql {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }

   model Post {
     authorId  Int?
     content   String?
     id        Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
     published Boolean @default(false)
     title     String
     User      User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
   }

   model User {
     email String  @unique
     id    Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
     name  String?
     Post  Post[]
   }

   + model Draft {
   +   title     String
   +   id        Int     @unique
   +   email     String
   +   published Boolean
   +  }
   ```

## 6. Generate Prisma Client

In this section, you will generate Prisma Client.

1. Add a `generator` block to your Prisma schema (typically added right below the `datasource` block):

   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }
   ```

2. Run the following command to install and generate Prisma Client in your project:

   ```bash-symbol
   npx prisma generate
   ```

Now you can use Prisma Client to send database queries in Node.js.

## 9. Validate the `Draft` view in a Node.js script

In the following section, you will use the `drafts` model property to return `Post` records that have not yet been published. To use the `drafts` model property:

1. Create a new file named `index.js` and add the following code to it:

   ```ts
   const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

   const prisma = new PrismaClient({})

   async function main() {
     const sarahPosts = await prisma.user.create({
       data: {
         name: 'Sarah',
         email: 'sarah@prisma.io',
         Post: {
           create: [
             { title: 'My first post', published: false },
             { title: 'All about databases', published: true },
             { title: 'Prisma Day 2020', published: false },
           ],
         },
       },
     })

     const emilyPosts = await prisma.user.create({
       data: {
         name: 'Emily',
         email: 'emily@prisma.io',
         Post: {
           create: [
             { title: 'My first post', published: false },
             { title: 'All about databases', published: true },
             { title: 'Prisma Day 2020', published: false },
           ],
         },
       },
     })

     const drafts = await prisma.draft.findMany({})

     console.log(drafts)

     const filteredDrafts = await prisma.draft.findMany({
       where: {
         email: 'sarah@prisma.io',
       },
     })

     console.log(filteredDrafts)
   }

   main()
     .catch(e => {
       throw e
     })
     .finally(async () => {
       await prisma.disconnect()
     })
   ```

   This example:

   - Creates two `User` records with three `Post` records each
   - Returns all `Draft` records from the view
   - Returns all `Draft` records from the view where the author's email is `emily@prisma.io`

2. Run the code with the following command:

   ```bash-symbol-symbol
   node index.js
   ```

   The following output indicates that the view works as expected - the first query returns all drafts (`Post` records where `published` is `false`), and the second query returns drafts by `emily@prisma.io` only):

   ```json
   /* ALL DRAFTS */
   [
     {
       "title": "My first post",
       "id": 37,
       "email": "sarah@prisma.io",
       "published": false
     },
     {
       "title": "Prisma Day 2020",
       "id": 39,
       "email": "sarah@prisma.io",
       "published": false
     },
     {
       "title": "My first post",
       "id": 40,
       "email": "emily@prisma.io",
       "published": false
     },
     {
       "title": "Prisma Day 2020",
       "id": 42,
       "email": "emily@prisma.io",
       "published": false
     }
   ][
     /* FILTERED DRAFTS */
     ({
       "title": "My first post",
       "id": 37,
       "email": "sarah@prisma.io",
       "published": false
     },
     {
       "title": "Prisma Day 2020",
       "id": 39,
       "email": "sarah@prisma.io",
       "published": false
     })
   ]
   ```
