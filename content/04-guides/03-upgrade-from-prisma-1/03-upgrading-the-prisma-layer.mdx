## Overview

This page explains the first step of your upgrade process: Taking your Prisma 1 configuration and upgrading it to Prisma 2.0. Concretely, you will learn how to:

1. Add the Prisma 2.0 CLI as a development dependency
1. Create your Prisma 2.0 schema
1. Determine your connection URL and connect to your database
1. Introspect your database (that was so far managed with Prisma 1)
1. Use the [Prisma schema upgrade CLI](./how-to-upgrade#prisma-schema-upgrade-cli) to resolve the [schema incompatibilities](./schema-incompatibilities) in the new Prisma 2.0 data model
1. Install and generate Prisma Client

Once done with these steps, you can move on to the next guide that explains how you can upgrade the application layer to use Prisma Client for your database queries.

> **Note**: During the upgrade process it can be helpful to get a graphical view on your database. It is therefore recommended to use a graphical database client to connect to your database, such as [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) or [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/).

## 1. Install Prisma 2.0 CLI 

The Prisma 2.0 CLI is available as the [`@prisma/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/cli) package on npm and is invoked via the `prisma` command.

Note that the former `prisma` command for Prisma 1 has been renamed to `prisma1`. You can learn more about this [here](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-2-beta-b7bcl0gd8d8e/#renaming-the-prisma2-cli).

You can install the Prisma 2.0 CLI in your Node.js project as follows (be sure to invoke this command in the directory where your `package.json` is located):

```copy
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
```

> **Note**: With Prisma 1, it was usually recommended to install the CLI globally. We now recommend to [install the Prisma CLI locally](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-cli/installation#local-installation-recommended) to prevent version conflicts.

You can now use the local installation of the `prisma` CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```
npx prisma
```

If you're upgrading your entire project [all at once](./how-to-upgrade#upgrade-strategies), you can now also uninstall the Prisma 1 CLI (otherwise expand below):

```
# remove global installation
npm uninstall -g prisma

# remove local installation
npm uninstall prisma
```

<br />
<details><summary>Expand if you want to keep using your Prisma 1 CLI side-by-side</summary>

If you want to keep using the Prisma 1 CLI, it is recommend to remove your global installation of it and add the `prisma1` CLI as a development dependency:

```
# installs v1.34 of the Prisma 1 CLI
npm uninstall -g prisma
npm install prisma1 --save-dev
```

You can now invoke it as follows:

```
npx prisma1
```

Note that if you need a CLI version smaller than 1.34 (e.g. 1.30), you can install it as follows:

```
# installs v1.30 of the Prisma 1 CLI
npm uninstall -g prisma@1.30
npm install prisma@1.30 --save-dev
```

You can now invoke it as follows:

```
npx prisma
```

Because the CLI command of this version is identical to the Prisma 2 CLI command (in both cases, it's just `prisma`), there might be [name clashes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2433) between the two. You might have to uninstall the `@prisma/cli` package if you want to run Prisma 1 commands.

</details>

## 2. Create your Prisma 2.0 schema

For this guide, you'll first create a new Prisma schema using the `prisma init` command and then "fill" it with a data model using [introspection](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/introspection).

Run the following command to create your Prisma schema (note that this throws an error if you already have a folder called `prisma`):

```copy
npx prisma init
```

If you're seeing the following error, you need to rename your current `prisma` directory:

```bash
$ npx prisma init
 ERROR  A folder called prisma already exists in your project.
        Please try again in a project that is not yet using Prisma.
```

You can rename the current `prisma` directory to `prisma1` to make it clear that this holds the former Prisma 1 configuration:

```bash copy
mv prisma prisma1
```

Now you can run `init` and it will succeed:

```copy
npx prisma init
```

It should print the following output:

```
$ npx prisma init

âœ” Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma.
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

Next steps:
1. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql or sqlite.
2. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started.
3. Run prisma introspect to turn your database schema into a Prisma data model.
4. Run prisma generate to install Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

More information in our documentation:
https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
```

The command created a new folder called `prisma` with two files:

- `schema.prisma`: Your Prisma schema file that specifies the [data source](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-sources), [generator](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/generators) and [data model](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model) (note that the data model doesn't exist yet, it will be generated via introspection).
- `.env`: A [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme) file to configure your database [connection URL](../../reference/database-connectors/connection-urls).

Your initial Prisma schema looks as follows:

```prisma
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

With Prisma 1, you specify which language variant of the Prisma client you wanted to use in your `prisma.yml`. With Prisma 2.0, this information is now also contained inside the Prisma schema via a `generator` block. 

> **Note**: Unlike Prisma 1, the TypeScript and JavaScript variants of Prisma Client 2.0 use the _same_ generator called `prisma-client-js`. The generated types in `index.d.ts` are _always_ included, even in plain JavaScript projects. This enables feature like autocompletion in VS Code even when not using TypeScript.

## 3. Determine your connection URL and connect to your database

With Prisma 1, the database connection is configured in the Docker Compose file that's used to launch the Prisma server. The Prisma server then exposes a GraphQL endpoint (via HTTP) that proxies all database requests from the Prisma client application code. That HTTP endpoint is specified in your `prisma.yml`.

With Prisma 2.0, the HTTP layer isn't exposed any more and Prisma Client 2.0 is configured to run requests "directly" against the database (that is, requests are proxied by Prisma's [query engine](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/query-engine), but there isn't an extra server any more).

So, as a next step you'll need to tell Prisma 2.0 _what_ kind of database you use (MySQL or PostgreSQL) and _where_ it is located.

First, you need to ensure that that `provider` field on the `datasource` block inside `schema.prisma` is configured to use the right database:

- If you're using PostgreSQL, it needs to define the value `"postgresql"` in the `provider` field. 
- If you're using MySQL, it needs to define the value `"mysql"` in the `provider` field.

Switch around with the tabs in the code block to see examples of both:

<CodeBlock languages={["PostgreSQL", "MySQL"]}>

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

</CodeBlock>

With the `provider` field set, you can go ahead and configure the connection URL inside the `.env` file. 

Assume the database configuration in your Docker Compose file that you used to deploy your Prisma server looks as follows:

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'postgresql']}>

```yml
PRISMA_CONFIG: |
  port: 4466
  databases:
    default:
      connector: postgres
      host: postgres
      port: 5432
      user: prisma
      password: prisma
```

Also assume your `endpoint` in `prisma.yml` is configured as follows:

```yml
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/myproject/dev
```

Based on these connection details, you need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable inside your `.env` file as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/prisma?schema=myproject$dev"
```

Note that the `schema` argument is typically composed of your _service name_ and _service stage_ (which are part of the `endpoint` in `prisma.yml`), separated by the `$` character. 

Sometimes no service name and stage are specified in `prisma.yml`:

```
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/
```

In that case, the `schema` must be specified as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/prisma?schema=default$default"
```

</SwitchTech>

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'mysql']}>

```yml
PRISMA_CONFIG: |
  port: 4466
  databases:
    default:
      connector: mysql
      host: mysql
      port: 3306
      user: root
      password: randompassword
```

Also assume your `endpoint` in `prisma.yml` is configured as follows:

```yml
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/myproject/dev
```

Based on these connection details, you need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable inside your `.env` file as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:randompassword@localhost:3306/myproject@dev"
```

Note that the _database name_ in the connection string is typically composed of your _service name_ and _service stage_ (which are part of the `endpoint` in `prisma.yml`), separated by the `@` character. 

Sometimes no service name and stage are specified in `prisma.yml`:

```
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/
```

In that case, the database name must be specified as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:randompassword@localhost:5432/default@default"
```

## 4. Introspect your database

For the purpose of this guide, we'll use the following Prisma 1 data model (select the **SQL** tab below to see what the data model maps to in SQL):

<CodeBlock languages={["Prisma 1 datamodel", "SQL"]}>

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  email: String @unique
  name: String!
  role: Role! @default(value: CUSTOMER)
  jsonData: Json 
  profile: Profile
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
  title: String!
  content: String
  published: Boolean! @default(value: false)
  author: User @relation(link: TABLE)
  categories: [Category!]!
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @id
  bio: String
  user: User! @relation(link: INLINE)
}

type Category {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

enum Role {
  ADMIN
  CUSTOMER
}
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE"User" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    email text,
    name text NOT NULL,
    role text NOT NULL,
    "jsonData" text
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "User_pkey" ON"User"(id text_ops);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "default$default.User.email._UNIQUE" ON"User"(email text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"Post" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    title text NOT NULL,
    published boolean NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" timestamp(3) without time zone NOT NULL,
    "updatedAt" timestamp(3) without time zone NOT NULL,
    content text
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Post_pkey" ON"Post"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"Profile" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    bio text,
    user character varying(25) REFERENCES"User"(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Profile_pkey" ON"Profile"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"Category" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    name text NOT NULL
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Category_pkey" ON"Category"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"_PostToUser" (
    "A" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"Post"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "B" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"User"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "_PostToUser_AB_unique" ON"_PostToUser"("A" text_ops,"B" text_ops);
CREATE INDEX "_PostToUser_B" ON"_PostToUser"("B" text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"_CategoryToPost" (
    "A" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"Category"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "B" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"Post"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_AB_unique" ON"_CategoryToPost"("A" text_ops,"B" text_ops);
CREATE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_B" ON"_CategoryToPost"("B" text_ops);
```

</CodeBlock>

Note that this data model has three [relations](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations):

- 1-1: `User` â†” `Profile`
- 1-n: `User` â†” `Post`  (maintained via the `_PostToUser` relation table)
- m-n: `Post` â†” `Category` (maintained via the `_CategoryToPost` relation table)

Now you can run Prisma's introspection against your database with the following command:

``` copy
npx prisma introspect
```

Here's a graphical illustration for what happens when `introspect` is invoked:

![](https://imgur.com/f7itiYw.png)

For the above Prisma 1 datamodel, this results in the following Prisma 2.0 schema (note that the models and fields have been reorded to match the initial order of the Prisma 1 datamodel):

```prisma
model User {
  id       String    @id
  email    String?   @unique
  name     String
  role     String
  jsonData String?
  Profile  Profile[]
  Post     Post[]    @relation(references: [id])
}

model Post {
  id        String     @id
  createdAt DateTime
  updatedAt DateTime
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean
  User      User[]     @relation(references: [id])
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  id   String  @id
  bio  String?
  user String?
  User User?   @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
}

model Category {
  id   String @id
  name String
  Post Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

While this is already a valid Prisma 2.0 schema, it lacks a number of _features_ that were part of its Prisma 1 equivalent:

- no auto-generated default CUID values for `@id` fields
- no auto-generated date values for the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields on `Post`
- no default value for the `role` field on `User`
- no default value for the `published` field on `Post`

There further are a number of inconsistencies which result in a less idiomatic/ergonomic Prisma Client API:

- `User` â†” `Profile` is a 1-n instead of 1-1 relation
- `User` â†” `Post` is a m-n instead of 1-n relation
- relation fields are uppercased (e.g. `Profile` and `Post` on `User`)
- the `jsonData` field on `User` is of type `String` instead of `Json`
- the `role` field on `User` is of type `String` instead of `Role`, the `enum` definition for role is missing altogether

While these inconsistencies don't actually impact the "feature set" you'll have available in your Prisma Client API, they make you lose certain constraints/guarantees that were present before. 

For example, Prisma now won't guarantee that a `User` is connected to _at most_ one `Profile` because the relation between the tables was recognized as 1-n during introspection, so one `User` record _could_ now get connected to multiple `Profile` records. 

Another issue is that you can store whatever text for the `jsonData` and `role` fields, regardless of whether it's valid JSON or represents a value of the `Role` enum.

To learn more about these inconsistencies check out the [Schema incompatibilities](./schema-incompatibilities) page.

In the following, we'll go through these incompatibilities and fix them one by one using the Prisma schema upgrade CLI.

## 5. Use the Prisma schema upgrade CLI to resolve schema incompatibilities

The [Prisma schema upgrade CLI](./how-to-upgrade#prisma-schema-upgrade-cli) is an interactive tool that helps you upgrading your Prisma schema and ironing out most of the inconsistencies listed above.

You can either install it locally in your project, or invoke it once without installation using `npx`:

```
npx prisma-upgrade prisma1/datamodel.graphql prisma/schema.prisma
```

The CLI will greet you with the following message:

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'postgres']}>

```
Welcome to the Prisma 1 to Prisma 2 upgrade tool.

This tool is designed to help you gracefully transition your postgresql database from Prisma 1 to Prisma 2.

Here's how it works:

  1. We inspect the contents of your Prisma 1 datamodel file.
  2. We generate SQL commands for you to run on your database.
  3. We re-introspect your database to get a new Prisma 2 Schema.
  4. We apply any Prisma-specific changes to the new Prisma 2 Schema

We will not try to migrate your database for you. You are in full control
over the changes to your postgresql database.

We suggest you first run the subsequent SQL commands on your testing or staging postgresql database.
Then when you're confident with the transition you can migrate your production database.

If you have any questions along the way, please reach out to hi@prisma.io.
    
âœ” Are you ready to get started? y/N
```

### 5.1. Set `DEFAULT` constraints in the database

The first thing the tool does is help you resolve the issue that [default values aren't represented in the database](./schema-incompatibilities#default-values-arent-represented-in-database) by generating SQL statements that add the respective `DEFAULT` constraints directly to the database.

In this case, two `DEFAULT` constraints are missing which are suggested by the tool:

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'postgres']}>

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's @default's to default values backed by the database. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE User ALTER COLUMN role SET DEFAULT 'CUSTOMER';
  ALTER TABLE Post ALTER COLUMN published SET DEFAULT FALSE;
```

Note that you need to [adjust](https://github.com/prisma/upgrade/issues/14) these statements before running them against your database: The table names need to be specified in double quotes and prefixed with the schema name (which should be specified in double quotes as well):

```sql
ALTER TABLE "default$default"."User" ALTER COLUMN role SET DEFAULT 'CUSTOMER';
ALTER TABLE "default$default"."Post" ALTER COLUMN published SET DEFAULT FALSE;
```

You can now run these SQL statements against your database either using a command line client or a GUI like Postico:

![](https://imgur.com/o4dJJic.png)

</SwitchTech>

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'mysql']}>

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's @default's to default values backed by the database. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE User CHANGE role role varchar(191) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'CUSTOMER';
  ALTER TABLE Post CHANGE published published tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

You can now run these SQL statements against your database either using a command line client or a GUI like TablePlus:

![](https://imgur.com/Qr7L1Nc.png)

</SwitchTech>

After having added the `DEFAULT` constraints successfully, you can move on in the CLI by hitting the <kbd>y</kbd> button again.

```
âœ” Done migrating @default? Press 'y' to continue â€¦ yes
```

### 5.2. Set default values for `@createdAt` fields

The next thing the tools does is help you resolve the issue that the behaviour of [`@createdAt` isn't represented in database](./schema-incompatibilities#default-values-arent-represented-in-database)

The CLI currently shows the following output:

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'postgres']}>

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's @createdAt to a datetime type with a default value of now. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE Post ALTER COLUMN createdAt SET DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

The CLI suggests to replicate the behaviour of `@createdAt` by adding another `DEFAULT` constraint with the value `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. After introspection, this will not be added as the `@createdAt` attribute, but as `@default(now())` in the new Prisma schema.

Note that you need to [adjust](https://github.com/prisma/upgrade/issues/14) these statements before running them against your database: The table and column names need to be specified in double quotes. Table names must also be prefixed with the schema name (which should be specified in double quotes as well):

```sql
ALTER TABLE "default$default"."Post" ALTER COLUMN "createdAt" SET DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

You can now run these SQL statements against your database either using a command line client or a GUI like Postico:

![](https://imgur.com/PvuQVkj.png)

</SwitchTech>

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'mysql']}>

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's @createdAt to a datetime type with a default value of now. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE Post CHANGE createdAt createdAt datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

The CLI suggests to replicate the behaviour of `@createdAt` by adding another `DEFAULT` constraint with the value `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. After introspection, this will not be added as the `@createdAt` attribute, but as `@default(now())` in the new Prisma schema.

Go ahead and run this statement against your database now.

![](https://imgur.com/L9sj36r.png)

</SwitchTech>

You can move on in the CLI by hitting the <kbd>y</kbd> button again.

```
âœ” Done migrating @createdAt? Press 'y' to continue â€¦ yes
```

### 5.3. Set default values for `@updatedAt` fields

The next thing the tools does is help you resolve the issue that the behaviour of [`@updated` isn't represented in database](./schema-incompatibilities#updatedat-isnt-represented-in-database).

The CLI currently shows the following output:

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's @updatedAt to a datetime type with a default value of now. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE Post CHANGE updatedAt updatedAt datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

The CLI suggests to replicate the behaviour of `@updated` by adding another `DEFAULT` constraint with the value `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` (see this open [GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/upgrade/issues/2)).

Go ahead and run this statement against your database now.

![](https://imgur.com/8W9IbYB.png)

You can move on in the CLI by hitting the <kbd>y</kbd> button again.

```
? Done migrating @updatedAt? Press 'y' to continue â€º (y/N)
```

### 5.4. Add `UNIQUE` constraint on foreign key to enforce 1-1 relationships

Next, the tool will help you [turn the current 1-n relation between `User` â†” `Profile`  back into a 1-1 relation](./schema-incompatibilities##inline-1-1-relations-are-recognized-as-1-n-missing-unique-constraint) by adding a `UNIQUE` constraint to the foreign key column called `user` (named after the relation field in the Prisma 1 datamodel) in the database.

The CLI currently shows the following output:

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's 1-to-1 relations with @relation or @relation(link:INLINE) to unique constraints on the database. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE Profile ADD UNIQUE (user);
```

Go ahead and run this statement against your database now.

![](https://imgur.com/ALlkwat.png)

You can move on in the CLI by hitting the <kbd>y</kbd> button again.

```
? Done migrating your inline relations? Press 'y' to continue â€º (y/N)
```

### 5.5. Fix `Json` columns by changing column types from plain text to `Json`

Next, the tool helps you ensure that `Json` fields in your Prisma 1 datamodel will be represented as `JSON` columns in the underlying database, right now they are represented as plain strings (e.g. as `MEDIUMTEXT` in MySQL).

The CLI currently shows the following output:

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's Json type to a json type in the database. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE User CHANGE jsonData jsonData JSON;
```

Changing the column type to `JSON` will ensure that the field is properly recognized as `Json` during Prisma 2 introspection.

Go ahead and run this statement against your database now.

![](https://imgur.com/feI3ZUF.png)

You can move on in the CLI by hitting the <kbd>y</kbd> button again.

```
? Done migrating Json? Press 'y' to continue â€º (y/N)
```

### 5.6. Final result

The final version of the Prisma schema should look as follows:

```prisma
model Category {
  id   String @id
  name String
  Post Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Post {
  content   String?
  createdAt DateTime   @default(now())
  id        String     @id
  published Boolean    @default(false)
  title     String
  updatedAt DateTime   @default(now())
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
  User      User[]     @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  bio  String?
  id   String  @id
  user String? @unique
  User User?   @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
}

model User {
  email    String?  @unique
  id       String   @id
  jsonData Json?
  name     String
  role     String   @default("CUSTOMER")
  Profile  Profile?
  Post     Post[]   @relation(references: [id])
}
```

## 6. Manually resolve remaining schema incompatibilities

There are a few schema incompatibilities that were not yet resolved by the Prisma schema upgrade CLI.

Note that this guide will be continuously updated to incorporate the new [features](https://github.com/prisma/upgrade#current-features) of the upgrade CLI. For now, you can just follow the guide here and transfer the given SQL statements to your own setup.

### 6.1. Fix enum column

Right now, the `Role` enum is missing from the datamodel. That's because the enum fields from the Prisma 1 datamodel have been represented as plain strings in the database (e.g. as `MEDIUMTEXT` in MySQL). Consequently, the `role` field on `User` is currently defined as `String` in the new Prisma schema.

To fix this, you can set the type for the `role` column as a new `ENUM` with SQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE User MODIFY COLUMN role ENUM('ADMIN', 'CUSTOMER') DEFAULT 'CUSTOMER';
```

You can run this statement against your database now:

### 6.2. Fix incorrect m-n relations

As a next step, you'll fix all 1-1 and 1-n relations that Prisma 1 represents with relation tables and that [currently only exist as m-n relations](./schema-incompatibilities#all-non-inline-relations-are-recognized-as-m-n) in your new Prisma 2.0 schema. Concretely, this is the case for the `User` â†” `Post` relation which currently is defined as m-n but _should_ really be a 1-n relation. 

To fix this, you'll need to create a new foreign key column on `Post` to link directly to the `User` table. Then you'll need to migrate the foreign key values from the current relation table into the new foreign key column on `Post`. Finally, you can delete the relation table.

Here's the SQL statements for the sample data model from this guide:

For this fix, you'll need to run 3 SQL statements:

1. Create new column `authorId` on the `Post` table. This column should be a _foreign key_ that references the `id` field of the `User` table:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE `Post` ADD COLUMN `authorId` VARCHAR(25);
    ALTER TABLE `Post` ADD FOREIGN KEY (`authorId`) REFERENCES `User` (`id`);
    ```
1. Write a SQL query that reads all the rows from the `_PostToUser` relation table and for each row:
    1. Finds the respective `Post` record by looking up the value from column `A`
    1. Inserts the value from column `B` as the value for `authorId` into that `Post` record
    ```sql
    UPDATE Post, _PostToUser
    SET Post.authorId = _PostToUser.B
    WHERE Post.id = _PostToUser.A
    ```
1. Delete the `_PostToUser` relation table
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE `_PostToUser`;
    ```

After these commands, the user ID values of the records from column `B` of the relation table are migrated to the new `authorId` column.

### 6.3. Fix remaining issues

Note, at this point you still haven't fixed [scalar lists](./schema-incompatibilities##scalar-lists-arrays-are-maintained-with-extra-table#) and [cascading deletes](./schema-incompatibilities#cascading-deletes-are-not-supported-in-prisma-20). You can find the recommended workarounds for these on the [Schema incompatibilities](./schema-incompatibilities) page. 

### 6.4. Introspect database

Assume these have been fixed, you can now run introspection again to generate your updated Prisma schema with proper enum support and the 1-n relation bewtween `User` â†” `Post`:

```
npx prisma introspect
```

This should be the result when you now introspect your database:

```prisma
model Category {
  id   String @id
  name String
  Post Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Post {
  authorId  String?
  content   String?
  createdAt DateTime   @default(now())
  id        String     @id
  published Boolean    @default(false)
  title     String
  updatedAt DateTime   @default(now())
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  bio  String?
  id   String  @id
  user String? @unique
  User User?   @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
}

model User {
  email    String?    @unique
  id       String     @id
  jsonData Json?
  name     String
  role     User_role? @default(CUSTOMER)
  Profile  Profile?
}

enum User_role {
  ADMIN
  CUSTOMER
}
```

### 6.5. Rename relation fields

To make sure your Prisma Client queries feel natural and idiomatic, it's recommended to make a few adjustments to the Prisma in order to [configure your generated Prisma Client API](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/configuring-the-prisma-client-api).

Mostly, this means renaming [relation fields](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#relation-fields).

Because all relation fields are _virtual_, meaning they don't _manifest_ in the database, you can name them whathever you like.s In this case, all relation fields are lowercased and sometimes pluralized.

<!-- Also note that `@map` and `@@map` are being used: -->

## 7. Install and generate Prisma Client
