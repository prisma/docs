## Overview

This page explains the first step of your upgrade process: Taking your Prisma 1 configuration and upgrading it to Prisma 2.0. Concretely, you will learn how to:

1. Add the Prisma 2.0 CLI as a development dependency
1. Create your Prisma 2.0 schema
1. Determine your connection URL and connect your database
1. Introspect your database (that was so far managed with Prisma 1)
1. Use the [Prisma schema upgrade CLI](./should-you-upgrade#prisma-schema-upgrade-cli) to resolve the [schema incompatibilities](./schema-incompatibilities) in the new Prisma 2.0 data model
1. Install and generate Prisma Client

Once done with these steps, you can move on to the next guide that explains how you can upgrade the application layer to use Prisma Client for your database queries.

> **Note**: During the upgrade process it can be helpful to get a graphical view on your database. It is therefore recommended to use a graphical database client to connect to your database, such as [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) or [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/).

## 1. Install Prisma 2.0 CLI 

The Prisma 2.0 CLI is available as the [`@prisma/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/cli) package on npm and is invoked via the `prisma` command.

Note that the former `prisma` command for Prisma 1 has been renamed to `prisma1`. You can learn more about this [here](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-2-beta-b7bcl0gd8d8e/#renaming-the-prisma2-cli).

You can install the Prisma 2.0 CLI in your Node.js project as follows (be sure to invoke this command in the directory where your `package.json` is located):

```copy
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
```

> **Note**: With Prisma 1, it was usually recommended to install the CLI globally. We now recommend to [install the Prisma CLI locally](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-cli/installation#local-installation-recommended) to prevent version conflicts.

You can now use the local installation of the `prisma` CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```
npx prisma
```

If you're upgrading your entire project [all at once](./should-you-upgrade#upgrade-strategies), you can now also uninstall the Prisma 1 CLI (otherwise expand below):

```
# remove global installation
npm uninstall -g prisma

# remove local installation
npm uninstall prisma
```

<br />
<details><summary>Expand if you want to keep using your Prisma 1 CLI side-by-side</summary>

If you want to keep using the Prisma 1 CLI, it is recommend to remove your global installation of it and add the `prisma1` CLI as a development dependency:

```
# installs v1.34 of the Prisma 1 CLI
npm uninstall -g prisma
npm install prisma1 --save-dev
```

You can now invoke it as follows:

```
npx prisma1
```

Note that if you need a CLI version smaller than 1.34 (e.g. 1.30), you can install it as follows:

```
# installs v1.30 of the Prisma 1 CLI
npm uninstall -g prisma@1.30
npm install prisma@1.30 --save-dev
```

You can now invoke it as follows:

```
npx prisma
```

Because the CLI command of this version is identical to the Prisma 2 CLI command (in both cases, it's just `prisma`), there might be [name clashes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2433) between the two. You might have to uninstall the `@prisma/cli` package if you want to run Prisma 1 commands.

</details>

## 2. Create your Prisma 2.0 schema

For this guide, you'll first create a new Prisma schema using the `prisma init` command and then "fill" it with a data model using [introspection](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/introspection).

Run the following command to create your Prisma schema (note that this throws an error if you already have a folder called `prisma`):

```copy
npx prisma init
```

If you're seeing the following error, you need to rename your current `prisma` directory:

```bash
$ npx prisma init
 ERROR  A folder called prisma already exists in your project.
        Please try again in a project that is not yet using Prisma.
```

You can rename the current `prisma` directory to `prisma1` to make it clear that this holds the former Prisma 1 configuration:

```bash copy
mv prisma prisma1
```

Now you can run `init` and it will succeed:

```copy
npx prisma init
```

It should print the following output:

```
$ npx prisma init

✔ Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma.
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

Next steps:
1. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql or sqlite.
2. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started.
3. Run prisma introspect to turn your database schema into a Prisma data model.
4. Run prisma generate to install Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

More information in our documentation:
https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
```

The command created a new folder called `prisma` with two files:

- `schema.prisma`: Your Prisma schema file that specifies the [data source](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-sources), [generator](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/generators) and [data model](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model) (note that the data model doesn't exist yet).
- `.env`: A [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme) file to configure your database [connection URL](../../reference/database-connectors/connection-urls).

Your initial Prisma schema looks as follows:

```prisma
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

With Prisma 1, you specify which language variant of the Prisma client you wanted to use in your `prisma.yml`. With Prisma 2.0, this information is now also contained inside the Prisma schema via a `generator` block. 

> **Note**: Unlike Prisma 1, the TypeScript and JavaScript variants of Prisma Client 2.0 use the _same_ generator called `prisma-client-js`. The generated types in `index.d.ts` are _always_ included, even in plain JavaScript projects. This enables feature like autocompletion in VS Code even when not using TypeScript.

## 3. Determine your connection URL and connect your database

With Prisma 1, the database connection is configured in the Docker Compose file that's used to launch the Prisma server. The Prisma server then exposes a GraphQL endpoint (via HTTP) that proxies all database requests from the Prisma client application code. That HTTP endpoint is specified in your `prisma.yml`.

With Prisma 2.0, the HTTP layer isn't exposed any more and Prisma Client 2.0 is configured to run requests "directly" against the database (that is, requests are proxied by Prisma's [query engine](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/query-engine), but there isn't an extra server any more).

So, as a next step you'll need to tell Prisma 2.0 _what_ kind of database you use (MySQL or PostgreSQL) and _where_ it is located.

First, you need to ensure that that `provider` field on the `datasource` block inside `schema.prisma` is configured to use the right database. 

If you're using PostgreSQL, it needs to define the value `postgresql` in the `provider` field. If you're using MySQL, it needs to define the value `mysql` in the `provider` field. Switch around with the tabs in the code block to see examples of both:

<CodeBlock languages={["PostgreSQL", "MySQL"]}>

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

</CodeBlock>

With the `provider` field properly set, you can go ahead and configure the connection URL inside the `.env` file. 

Assume the database configuration in your Docker Compose file that you used to deploy your Prisma server looks as follows:

```yml
databases:
  default:
    connector: postgres
    host: host.docker.internal
    database: mydb
    schema: public
    user: janedoe
    password: janedoe
    ssl: false
    rawAccess: true
    port: '5432'
    migrations: true
```

Based on these connection details, you need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable inside your `.env` file as follows: 

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
```

When using **PostgreSQL**, the `schema` argument is typically composed of your _service name_ and _service stage_ and separated by the `$` character. 

**MySQL** doesn't have the concept of _schemas_, but the same combination of _service name_ and _service stage_ determine the _database name_, separated by the `@` character. Service name and service stage are configured as the last two _path_ componens on the `endpoint` in your `prisma.yml`.

```

</details> -->

## 4. Introspect your database

For the purpose of this guide, we'll use the following Prisma 1 data model (select the **SQL** tab below to see what the data model maps to in SQL):

<CodeBlock languages={["Prisma 1 datamodel", "SQL"]}>

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  email: String @unique
  name: String!
  role: Role! @default(value: CUSTOMER)
  jsonData: Json 
  profile: Profile
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
  title: String!
  content: String
  published: Boolean! @default(value: false)
  author: User @relation(link: TABLE)
  categories: [Category!]!
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @id
  bio: String
  user: User! @relation(link: INLINE)
}

type Category {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

enum Role {
  ADMIN
  CUSTOMER
}
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE"User" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    email text,
    name text NOT NULL,
    role text NOT NULL,
    "jsonData" text
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "User_pkey" ON"User"(id text_ops);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "default$default.User.email._UNIQUE" ON"User"(email text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"Post" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    title text NOT NULL,
    published boolean NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" timestamp(3) without time zone NOT NULL,
    "updatedAt" timestamp(3) without time zone NOT NULL,
    content text
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Post_pkey" ON"Post"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"Profile" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    bio text,
    user character varying(25) REFERENCES"User"(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Profile_pkey" ON"Profile"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"Category" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    name text NOT NULL
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Category_pkey" ON"Category"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"_PostToUser" (
    "A" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"Post"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "B" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"User"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "_PostToUser_AB_unique" ON"_PostToUser"("A" text_ops,"B" text_ops);
CREATE INDEX "_PostToUser_B" ON"_PostToUser"("B" text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"_CategoryToPost" (
    "A" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"Category"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "B" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"Post"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_AB_unique" ON"_CategoryToPost"("A" text_ops,"B" text_ops);
CREATE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_B" ON"_CategoryToPost"("B" text_ops);
```

</CodeBlock>

Note that this data model has three [relations](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations):

- 1-1: `User` ↔ `Profile`
- 1-n: `User` ↔ `Post`  (maintained via the `_PostToUser` relation table)
- m-n: `Post` ↔ `Category` (maintained via the `_CategoryToPost` relation table)

Now you can run Prisma's introspection against your database with the following command:

``` copy
npx prisma introspect
```

Here's a graphical illustration for what happens when `introspect` is invoked:

![](https://imgur.com/f7itiYw.png)

For the above Prisma 1 datamodel, this results in the following Prisma 2.0 schema (note that the models and fields have been reorded to match the initial order of the Prisma 1 datamodel):

```prisma
model User {
  id       String    @id
  email    String?   @unique
  name     String
  role     String
  jsonData String?
  Profile  Profile[]
  Post     Post[]    @relation(references: [id])
}

model Post {
  id        String     @id
  createdAt DateTime
  updatedAt DateTime
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean
  User      User[]     @relation(references: [id])
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  id   String  @id
  bio  String?
  user String?
  User User?   @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
}

model Category {
  id   String @id
  name String
  Post Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

While this is already a valid Prisma 2.0 schema, it lacks a number of _features_ that were part of its Prisma 1 equivalent:

- no auto-generated default CUID values for `@id` fields
- no auto-generated date values for the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields on `Post`
- no default value for the `role` field on `User`
- no default value for the `published` field on `Post`

There further are a number of inconsistencies which result in a less idiomatic/ergonomic Prisma Client API:

- `User` ↔ `Profile` is a 1-n instead of 1-1 relation
- `User` ↔ `Post` is a m-n instead of 1-n relation
- relation fields are uppercased (e.g. `Profile` and `Post` on `User`)
- the `jsonData` field on `User` is of type `String` instead of `Json`
- the `role` field on `User` is of type `String` instead of `Role`, the `enum` definition for role is missing altogether

While these inconsistencies don't actually impact the "feature set" you'll have available in your Prisma Client API, they make you lose certain constraints/guarantees that were present before. 

For example, Prisma now won't guarantee that a `User` is connected to _at most_ one `Profile` because the relation between the tables was recognized as 1-n during introspection, so one `User` record _could_ now get connected to multiple `Profile` records. 

Another issues is that you can store whatever text for the `jsonData` and `role` fields, regardless of whether it's valid JSON or represents a value of the `Role` enum.

To learn more about these inconsistencies check out the [Schema incompatibilities](./schema-incompatibilities) page.

In the following, we'll go through these incompatibilities and fix them one by one using the Prisma schema upgrade CLI.

## 5. Use the Prisma schema upgrade CLI to resolve schema incompatibilities

The [Prisma schema upgrade CLI](./should-you-upgrade#prisma-schema-upgrade-cli) is an interactive tool that helps you upgrading your Prisma schema and ironing out most the inconsistencies listed above.

You can either install it locally in your project, or invoke it once without installation using `npx`:

```
npx prisma-upgrade prisma1/datamodel.graphql prisma/schema.prisma
```

...

The final version of the Prisma schema should look as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://root:prisma@localhost:3306/default@default"
}

model User {
  id       String   @id
  email    String?  @unique
  name     String
  role     Role?    @default(CUSTOMER)
  jsonData Json?
  posts    Post[]
  profile  Profile?
}

model Post {
  id         String     @id
  createdAt  DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime   @updatedAt
  title      String
  content    String?
  published  Boolean    @default(false)
  author     User?      @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId   String?
  categories Category[] @relation(references: [id])

  @@index([authorId], name: "authorId")
}

model Profile {
  id     String  @id
  bio    String?
  user   User?   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId String? @map("user") @unique
}

model Category {
  id    String @id
  name  String
  posts Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}

enum Role {
  ADMIN
  CUSTOMER

  @@map("User_role")
}
```

## 6. Install and generate Prisma Client
