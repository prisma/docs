## Overview

This upgrade guide describes how to migrate a Node.js project that's based on [Prisma 1](https://github.com/prisma/prisma1) and uses the [Prisma client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-client/) to Prisma 2. 

> **Note**: During the upgrade process it can be helpful to get a graphical view on your database. It is therefore recommended to use a graphical database client to connect to your database, such as [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) or [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/).

## Main differences between Prisma 1 and Prisma 2.0

On a high-level, the biggest differences between Prisma 1 and Prisma 2.0 are the following:

- Prisma 2.0 doesn't require hosting a database proxy server (i.e., the [Prisma server](https://www.prisma.io/docs/1.34/prisma-server/)).
- Prisma 2.0 makes the features of Prisma 1 more modular and splits them into dedicated tools:
  - Prisma Client: An improved version of Prisma client 1.0
  - Prisma Migrate: Data modeling and migrations (formerly `prisma deploy`).
- Prisma 1 datamodel and `prisma.yml` have been merged into the [Prisma schema](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/prisma-schema-file).
- Prisma 2.0 uses its own [modeling language](https://github.com/prisma/specs/tree/master/schema) instead of being based on GraphQL SDL.
- Prisma 2.0 doesn't expose ["a GraphQL API for your database"](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-and-graphql-mfl5y2r7t49c/) anymore, but only allows for _programmatic access_ via the Prisma Client API.
- More powerful introspection allows connecting Prisma 2.0 to any existing database.

Based on these differences, the high-level steps to upgrade a project from using Prisma 1 are as follows:

1. Install the new Prisma 2.0 CLI as a development dependency
1. Use the Prisma 2.0 CLI to introspect your Prisma 1 database and generate your Prisma schema
1. Install and generate Prisma Client 2.0
1. Adjust your application code, specifically replace the API calls from the Prisma client 1.0 with those of Prisma Client 2.0

**Note that steps 3. and 4. will look somewhat different if you are:**

- **not using the Prisma client** (e.g. because you're using Prisma bindings).
- **building a GraphQL API using `nexus-prisma`**.

Both scenarios will be covered in other upgrade guides that are [coming soon](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1937). 

In this guide, we'll take a look at migrating a REST API from Prisma 1 to Prisma 2.0 based on this [Prisma 1 example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma1-examples/tree/master/typescript/rest-express).

> **Note**: If you're upgrading a project that uses `nexus-prisma`, be sure to check out [Robert Cooper](https://www.robertcooper.me/)'s [upgrade guide](https://www.robertcooper.me/migrating-prisma1-to-prisma2) as well as [Ahmed Elywa](https://github.com/AhmedElywa)'s project [`create-nexus-type`](https://github.com/oahtech/create-nexus-type) that converts Prisma models into Nexus `objectType` definitions.

## 1. Install Prisma 2.0 CLI 

The Prisma 2.0 CLI is available as the [`@prisma/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/cli) package on npm and is invoked via the `prisma` command.

Note that the former `prisma` command for Prisma 1 has been renamed to `prisma1`. You can learn more about this [here](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-2-beta-b7bcl0gd8d8e/#renaming-the-prisma2-cli).

You can install the Prisma 2.0 CLI in your Node.js project as follows (be sure to invoke this command in the directory where your `package.json` is located):

```copy
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
```

> **Note**: With Prisma 1, it was usually recommended to install the CLI globally. We now recommend to [install the Prisma CLI locally](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-cli/installation#local-installation-recommended) to prevent version conflicts.

You can now use the local installation of the `prisma` CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```copy
npx prisma
```

## 2. Introspect your database to generate the Prisma 2.0 data model

The [Prisma schema](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/prisma-schema-file) is the foundation for any project that uses Prisma 2.0. Think of the Prisma schema as the _combination_ of the Prisma 1 data model and `prisma.yml` configuration file.

### 2.1. Create your Prisma schema file

For this guide, you'll first create a new Prisma schema using the `prisma init` command and then "fill" it with a data model using [introspection](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/introspection).

Run the following command to create your Prisma schema:

```copy
npx prisma init
```

If you're seeing the following error, you need to rename your current `prisma` directory:

```bash
$ npx prisma init
 ERROR  A folder called prisma already exists in your project.
        Please try again in a project that is not yet using Prisma.
```

You can rename the current `prisma` directory to `prisma1` to make it clear that this holds the former Prisma 1 configuration:

```bash copy
mv prisma prisma1
```

Now you can run `init` and it will succeed:

```copy
npx prisma init
```

It should print the following output:

```
$ npx prisma init

âœ” Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma.
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

Next steps:
1. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql or sqlite.
2. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started.
3. Run prisma introspect to turn your database schema into a Prisma data model.
4. Run prisma generate to install Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

More information in our documentation:
https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
```

The command created a new folder called `prisma` with two files:

- `schema.prisma`: Your Prisma schema file that specifies the [data source](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-sources), [generator](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/generators) and [data model](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model) (note that the data model doesn't exist yet).
- `.env`: A [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme) file to configure your database [connection URL](../../reference/database-connectors/connection-urls).

Your initial Prisma schema looks as follows:

```prisma
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

With Prisma 1, you specify which language variant of the Prisma client you wanted to use in your `prisma.yml`. With Prisma 2.0, this information is now also contained inside the Prisma schema via a `generator` block. 

> **Note**: Unlike Prisma 1, the TypeScript and JavaScript variants of Prisma Client 2.0 use the _same_ generator called `prisma-client-js`. The generated types in `index.d.ts` are _always_ included, even in plain JavaScript projects. This enables feature like autocompletion in VS Code even when not using TypeScript.

<!-- 

Consider the [example datamodel](https://github.com/prisma/prisma1-examples/blob/master/typescript/rest-express/prisma/datamodel.prisma):

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  email: String! @unique
  name: String
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
  published: Boolean! @default(value: false)
  title: String!
  content: String
  author: User!
}
```

This Prisma 1 datamodel will be converted into the following Prisma schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id    String  @default(cuid()) @id @unique
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        String   @default(cuid()) @id @unique
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  published Boolean
  title     String
  content   String?
  author    User
}
```

> **Note**: The `@unique` attributes on the `id` fields are [redundant](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/786) as uniqueness is already implied by the `@id` attribute. It also contains another bug where it [doesn't convert `@default` attributes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/790), so you need to manually add the `@default(true)` to the `published` field in the Prisma schema.
 -->

<!-- 
There are two ways of obtaining a Prisma schema based on an existing Prisma 1 project:

- Writing the Prisma schema by hand
- Using introspection against the existing database

In this guide, you'll use introspection to obtain your Prisma data model. -->

### 2.2. Set your database connection URL

With Prisma 1, the database connection is configured in the Docker Compose file that's used to launch the Prisma server. The Prisma server then exposes a GraphQL endpoint (via HTTP) that proxies all database requests from the Prisma client application code. That HTTP endpoint is specified in your `prisma.yml`.

With Prisma 2.0, the HTTP layer isn't exposed any more and Prisma Client 2.0 is configured to run requests "directly" against the database (that is, requests are proxied by Prisma's [query engine](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/query-engine), but there isn't an extra server any more).

So, as a next step you'll need to tell Prisma 2.0 _what_ kind of database you use (MySQL or PostgreSQL) and _where_ it is located.

First, you need to ensure that that `provider` field on the `datasource` block inside `schema.prisma` is configured to use the right database. 

If you're using PostgreSQL, it needs to define the value `postgresql` in the `provider` field. If you're using MySQL, it needs to define the value `mysql` in the `provider` field. Switch around with the tabs in the code block to see examples of both:

<CodeBlock languages={["PostgreSQL", "MySQL"]}>

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

</CodeBlock>

With the `provider` field properly set, you can go ahead and configure the connection URL inside the `.env` file. 

Assume the database configuration in your Docker Compose file that you used to deploy your Prisma server looks as follows:

```yml
databases:
  default:
    connector: postgres
    host: host.docker.internal
    database: mydb
    schema: public
    user: janedoe
    password: janedoe
    ssl: false
    rawAccess: true
    port: '5432'
    migrations: true
```

Based on these connection details, you need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable inside your `.env` file as follows: 

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
```

> **Note for PostgreSQL users**: The `schema` argument is typically composed of your _service name_ and _service stage_ which are configured as the last two _path_ componens on the `endpoint` in your `prisma.yml`. 
>
> For example, if your `endpoint` is `http://localhost:4466/myproject/dev`, the schema will be called `myproject$dev`. If the `endpoint` is `http://localhost:4466/`, the schema will be called `default$default`.

Learn more on the [Connection URLs](../../reference/database-connectors/connection-urls) page.

### 2.3. Run the database introspection

For the purpose of this guide, we'll use an extended version of the [data model from the REST API example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma1-examples/blob/master/typescript/rest-express/prisma/datamodel.prisma) to illustrate several things that are relevant during the upgrade process:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  email: String! @unique
  name: String
  posts: [Post!]!
  profile: Profile
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
  published: Boolean! @default(value: false)
  title: String!
  content: String
  author: User!
  categories: [Category!]!
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @id
  bio: String
  user: User! @relation(link: INLINE)
}

type Category {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}
```

<details><summary>Expand to view the SQL schema created by Prisma 1</summary>

The above Prisma 1 datamodel is translated into the following SQL schema (in PostgreSQL dialect) when running `prisma1 deploy`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test$dev."User" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    email text NOT NULL,
    name text
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "User_pkey" ON test$dev."User"(id text_ops);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "test$dev.User.email._UNIQUE" ON test$dev."User"(email text_ops);

CREATE TABLE test$dev."Post" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    "createdAt" timestamp(3) without time zone NOT NULL,
    "updatedAt" timestamp(3) without time zone NOT NULL,
    published boolean NOT NULL,
    title text NOT NULL,
    content text,
    author character varying(25) REFERENCES test$dev."User"(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Post_pkey" ON test$dev."Post"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE test$dev."Profile" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    bio text,
    user character varying(25) REFERENCES test$dev."User"(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Profile_pkey" ON test$dev."Profile"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE test$dev."Category" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    name text NOT NULL
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Category_pkey" ON test$dev."Category"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE test$dev."_CategoryToPost" (
    "A" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES test$dev."Category"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "B" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES test$dev."Post"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_AB_unique" ON test$dev."_CategoryToPost"("A" text_ops,"B" text_ops);
CREATE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_B" ON test$dev."_CategoryToPost"("B" text_ops);
```

</details>

Note that this data model has three [relations](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations):

- 1-1: `User` â†” `Profile`
- 1-n: `User` â†” `Post`
- m-n: `Post` â†” `Category`

Now you can run Prisma's introspection against your database with the following command:

``` copy
npx prisma introspect
```

Here's a graphical illustration for what happens when `introspect` is invoked:

![](https://imgur.com/f7itiYw.png)

For the above Prisma 1 datamodel, this results in the following Prisma 2.0 schema (note that the models and fields have been reorded to match the initial order of the Prisma 1 datamodel):

```prisma
model User {
  id      String    @id
  email   String    @unique
  name    String?
  Post    Post[]
  Profile Profile[]
}

model Post {
  id        String     @id
  createdAt DateTime
  updatedAt DateTime
  published Boolean
  title     String
  content   String?
  author    String?
  User      User?      @relation(fields: [author], references: [id])
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  id   String  @id
  bio  String?
  user String?
  User User?   @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
}

model Category {
  id   String @id
  name String
  Post Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

As you might notice, the Prisma schema is missing or has adjusted some information from the Prisma 1 datamodel:

- On the `User` model:
  - The previous `posts` relation field has been renamed to `Post`
  - The previous `profile` relation field has been renamed to `Profile`
  - The previous 1-1 relation between `User` and `Profile` has been turned into a 1-n relation
- On the `Post` model:
  - The `createdAt` field doesn't have an [attribute](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model#attributes) (previously called "directive" in Prisma 1)
  - The `updatedAt` field doesn't have an [attribute](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model#attributes) (previously called "directive" in Prisma 1)
  - The `published` field misses a `@default` attribute
  - The relation to `User` is now represented with [two fields](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#annotated-relation-fields-and-relation-scalar-fields):
    - The type of `author` is now `String` and not `User`
    - The relation field `User` is now optional and uses the `@relation` attribute
  - The previous `categories` relation field has been renamed to `Category` and uses the `@relation` attribute
- On the `Profile` model:
  - The relation to `User` is now represented with [two fields](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#annotated-relation-fields-and-relation-scalar-fields):
    - The type of `user` is now `String` and not `User`
    - The relation field `User` is now optional and uses the `@relation` attribute
- On the `Category` model:
  - The previous `posts` relation field has been renamed to `Post` and uses the `@relation` attribute

Also note that that with Prisma 2.0, you alway must explicitly specify `@default` attributes if you want Prisma to generate [IDs](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model#ids) for you by default. Since none of the `@id` fields have `@default` values at the moment, you would need to supply your own ID values when creating new records with the new Prisma Client!

### 2.4. Fixing the Prisma 2.0 schema

As pointed out above, the Prisma 2.0 schema that was generated from introspection has changed and even misses a lot of information from the previous Prisma 1 datamodel.

The main reason for this is that in Prisma 1, most of these features have been _implemented by Prisma_ and did not actually manifest in the database. For example, `@default` directives in Prisma 1 were not mapped to `DEFAULT` constraints in SQL â€“Â instead the Prisma server would take care of generating these default values and inserting them into the database at runtime (if you took a look at the SQL schema that was shown in the expandable element above, you probably also noticed that).

Because much of the information from the Prisma 1 datamodel does not manifest in the database schema, it can't be recognized by Prisma's introspection (which is the reason why it doesn't appear in the new Prisma schema).

> **Note**: One major goal of Prisma 2.0 is to provide a _cleaner mapping_ from the Prisma schema to the database. With Prisma 2.0, most of the features from the Prisma schema do manifest in the database, with a few [exceptions](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/database-polyfills).

You generally have two ways to resolve many of the resulting issues:

- Manually adjust your database schema using SQL and re-introspect
- Adjust your Prisma schema to manually add the missing information

> **Note**: We are currently working on dedicated tooling that will help you to perform these tasks automatically. Please subscribe to this [Github issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1937) to get updates about the progress of these upgrade tools. 

Note that adjusting your database schema using SQL can not resolve _all_ issues, you will need to make manual adjustments to your Prisma schema as well during the upgrade process!

For this guide, we'll take the path of manually adjusting the Prisma schema and not touching the database at all.

> **Note**: Any manual changes you make to your Prisma schema will be lost after you re-run introspection because the Prisma schema file will be overwritten. It is therefore highly recommended to **backup your Prisma schema** before you're re-running introspection.

#### Adjusting the `User` model

The `User` model that was generated from introspection looks as follows (fields have been reordered to match the field order from the Prisma 1 datamodel):

```prisma
model User {
  id      String    @id
  email   String    @unique
  name    String?
  Post    Post[]
  Profile Profile[]
}
```

Recall the issues that need to be fixed here:

- The previous `posts` relation field has been renamed to `Post`
- The previous `profile` relation field has been renamed to `Profile`
- The previous 1-1 relation between `User` and `Profile` has been turned into a 1-n relation
- The `@id` field doesn't have a default value

The first one is fairly straightforward to resolve. [Relation fields](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#relation-fields) do not manifest in the underlying database and therefore are only relevant for the generated Prisma Client API. When generated from introspection, relation fields are named after the model they relate to (in this case the relation field is called `Post` because it denotes a relation to the `Post` model).

You can name these anything you like, so it can be renamed to `posts` again to match the name of the Prisma 1 datamodel.:

```diff
model User {
  id      String    @id
  email   String    @unique
  name    String?
+ posts   Post[]
  Profile Profile[]
}
```

The same for `Profile`, it can be lowercased to `profile` to match the name of the Prisma 1 data model. 

Introspection also turned the prior [1-1 relation](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#one-to-one-relations) into an [1-n relation](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#one-to-many-relations). That's because the foreign key column `user` on the `Profile` table does _not_ have a `UNIQUE` constraint in the database. Prisma therefore interprets it as a 1-n relation because there _might_ be multiple `Profile` records pointing to the same `User` record (in Prisma 1, 1-1 relations were implemented on a Prisma-level and therefore the `UNIQUE` constraint is missing).

To fix this, you can remove the `[]` after the `Profile` type:

```diff
model User {
  id      String    @id
  email   String    @unique
  name    String?
  posts   Post[]
+ profile Profile
}
```

Finally, you need to ensure that the `id` field is populated with default values. Prisma 1 used [cuid](https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid) values implicitly. In Prisma 2.0, you need to specify this via the `@default` attribute:

```diff
model User {
+ id      String    @id @default(cuid())
  email   String    @unique
  name    String?
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile
}
```

This is the final `User` type after all adjustments:

```prisma
model User {
  id      String    @id @default(cuid())
  email   String    @unique
  name    String?
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile
}
```

#### Adjusting the `Post` model

The `Post` model that was generated from introspection looks as follows (fields have been reordered to match the field order from the Prisma 1 datamodel):

```prisma
model Post {
  id        String     @id
  createdAt DateTime
  updatedAt DateTime
  published Boolean
  title     String
  content   String?
  author    String?
  User      User?      @relation(fields: [author], references: [id])
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

Recall the issues that need to be fixed here:

- The `createdAt` field doesn't have an [attribute](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model#attributes) (previously called "directive" in Prisma 1)
- The `updatedAt` field doesn't have an [attribute](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model#attributes) (previously called "directive" in Prisma 1)
- The `published` field misses a `@default` attribute
- The relation to `User` is now represented with [two fields](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#annotated-relation-fields-and-relation-scalar-fields):
  - The type of `author` is now `String` and not `User`
  - The relation field `User` is now optional and uses the `@relation` attribute
- The previous `categories` relation field has been renamed to `Category` and uses the `@relation` attribute
- The `@id` field doesn't have a default value

The `@createdAt` attribute from Prisma 1 is represented via the `@default(now())` attribute in Prisma 2.0. `@updatedAt` still exists in the same way as before:

```diff
model Post {
  id        String     @id
+ createdAt DateTime   @default(now())
+ updatedAt DateTime   @updatedAt
  published Boolean
  title     String
  content   String?
  author    String?
  User      User?      @relation(fields: [author], references: [id])
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

Similarly you can add the `@default` attribute to `published` like so:

```diff
model Post {
  id        String     @id
  createdAt DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime   @updatedAt
+ published Boolean    @default(false)
  title     String
  content   String?
  author    String?
  User      User?      @relation(fields: [author], references: [id])
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

> **Note**: In Prisma 2.0, the `@default` attribute works on both the Prisma-level _and_ the database-level. So, while there's not `DEFAULT` constraint defined in the database, you can still add it to your Prisma schema and Prisma Client will insert the default values for you. Note that if the database specifies a different default value than Prisma Client, the default value from Prisma Client takes precedence.

Moving on to the `author` relation field from Prisma 1 that has been split into two fields during introspection. The reason why this happened is because the first Prisma 2.0 Beta introduced a [new relation syntax](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.1) which requires a relation field with a [relation scalar](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#annotated-relation-fields-and-relation-scalar-fields) on one side of a relation.

The recommended way to resolve this is by renaming the relation scalar field and mapping it to the foreign key in the underlying database using [`@map`](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model#mapping-column,-table-and-enum-names). That way you can reuse the same name for the relation that you used in the Prisma 1 datamodel:

```diff
model Post {
  id        String     @id
  createdAt DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime   @updatedAt
  published Boolean    @default(false)
  title     String
  content   String?
+ authorId  String?    @map("author")
+ author    User?      @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

Finally, you can also rename the `Category` field to `categories`:

```prisma
model Post {
  id        Â String     @id
  createdAt  DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime   @updatedAt
  published Â Boolean    @default(false)
  title     Â String
  content   Â String?
  authorId   String?    @map("author")
  author     User?      @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
+ categories Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

This is the `Post` model after all adjustments:

```prisma
model Post {
  id        Â String     @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt  DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime   @updatedAt
  published Â Boolean    @default(false)
  title     Â String
  content   Â String?
  authorId   String?    @map("author")
  author     User?      @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  categories Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

#### Adjusting the `Profile` model

The `Profile` model that was generated from introspection looks as follows (fields have been reordered to match the field order from the Prisma 1 datamodel):

```prisma
model Profile {
  id   String  @id
  bio  String?
  user String?
  User User?   @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
}
```

Recall the issues that need to be fixed here:

- The relation to `User` is now represented with [two fields](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#annotated-relation-fields-and-relation-scalar-fields):
  - The type of `user` is now `String` and not `User`
  - The relation field `User` is now optional and uses the `@relation` attribute
- The `@id` field doesn't have a default value

Similar to how the issue with the two relation fields was resolved on `Post` (by using `@map`) you can also resolve it here:

```diff
model Profile {
  id     String  @id
  bio    String?
+ userId String? 
+ user   User?   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

This is the `Profile` model after all adjustments:

```prisma
model Profile {
  id     String  @id @default(cuid())
  bio    String?
  userId String? 
  user   User?   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

#### Adjusting the `Category` model

The `Category` model that was generated from introspection looks as follows (fields have been reordered to match the field order from the Prisma 1 datamodel):

```prisma
model Category {
  id   String @id
  name String
  Post Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

Recall the issue that needs to be fixed here:

- The previous `posts` relation field has been renamed to `Post` and uses the `@relation` attribute
- The `@id` field doesn't have a default value

Because the `Post` relation field does not manifest in the database schema, you can name it whatever you like in the Prisma schema without an extra mapping. So you can rename it to `posts` again:

```diff
model Category {
  id    String @id
  name  String
+ posts Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

This is the `Category` model after all adjustments:

```prisma
model Category {
  id    String @id @default(cuid())
  name  String
  posts Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

#### Other issues that are not mentioned in this guide

Additionally to the issues that were explained in the previous sections, you might encounter other friction points:

- **Cascading deletes** in Prisma 1 were implemented by Prisma and did not manifest in the database. The only way to get similar behavior with Prisma 2.0 at the moment is by configuring it on the database-level. You can follow the guides for [PostgreSQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database-workflows/cascading-deletes/postgresql) and [MySQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database-workflows/cascading-deletes/mysql) for this.
- The **`JSON`** type from Prisma 1 currently gets mapped to `String` in Prisma 2. The only way to resolve this is by adjusting the column type in the database to `JSON`.
- **Enums** in Prisma 1 used to be represented as _strings_ in the underlying database. We'll provide more info on how you can upgrade these soon.
- **Scalar lists (arrays)** in Prisma 1 used to be implemented using an extra table in the underlying database. We'll provide more info on how you can upgrade these soon.

## 3. Adjust the application to use Prisma Client 2.0

With all of the adjustments to the Prisma schema in place, you can now [generate Prisma Client 2.0](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/generating-prisma-client) and adjust your application code!

Prisma Client 2.0 is generated into [`node_modules/@prisma/client`](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/generating-prisma-client#the-prisma-client-npm-module). In order for this package to "survive" the pruning of Node.js package managers, you first need to install it as an npm dependency:

```
npm install @prisma/client
```

The next thing you need to do in order to be able use Prisma Client 2.0 in your application code is to _generate_ it. Similar to Prisma 1, the generators in your Prisma schema file can be invoked by running the `generate` CLI command:

```
npx prisma generate
```

To make the migration complete, you have to change your application code and replace the usage of the Prisma client with the new Prisma Client 2.0.

The application code in our example is located in a single file and looks as follows:

```ts
import * as express from 'express'
import * as bodyParser from 'body-parser'
import { prisma } from './generated/prisma-client'

const app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.json())

app.post(`/user`, async (req, res) => {
  const result = await prisma.createUser({
    ...req.body,
  })
  res.json(result)
})

app.post(`/post`, async (req, res) => {
  const { title, content, authorEmail } = req.body
  const result = await prisma.createPost({
    title: title,
    content: content,
    author: { connect: { email: authorEmail } },
  })
  res.json(result)
})

app.put('/publish/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.updatePost({
    where: { id },
    data: { published: true },
  })
  res.json(post)
})

app.delete(`/post/:id`, async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.deletePost({ id })
  res.json(post)
})

app.get(`/post/:id`, async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.post({ id })
  res.json(post)
})

app.get('/feed', async (req, res) => {
  const posts = await prisma.post({ where: { published: true } })
  res.json(posts)
})

app.get('/filterPosts', async (req, res) => {
  const { searchString } = req.query
  const draftPosts = await prisma.post({
    where: {
      OR: [
        {
          title_contains: searchString,
        },
        {
          content_contains: searchString,
        },
      ],
    },
  })
  res.json(draftPosts)
})

app.listen(3000, () =>
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000'),
)
```

Consider each occurence of the Prisma client instance `prisma` and replacing with the respective usage of Prisma Client 2.0. You can learn more in the [API Reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/api).

### 3.1. Adjusting the import

Since Prisma Client 2.0 is generated into `node_modules/@prisma/client`, it is imported as follows:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
```

Note that this only imports the `PrismaClient` constructor, so you also need to instantiate a Prisma Client 2.0 instance:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

### 3.2. Adjusting the `/user` route (`POST`)

With the Prisma Client 2.0 API, the `/user` route for `POST` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.post(`/user`, async (req, res) => {
  const result = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      ...req.body,
    },
  })
  res.json(result)
})
```

### 3.3. Adjusting the `/post` route (`POST`)

With the Prisma Client 2.0 API, the `/post` route for `POST` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.post(`/post`, async (req, res) => {
  const { title, content, authorEmail } = req.body
  const result = await prisma.post.create({
    data: {
      title: title,
      content: content,
      author: { connect: { email: authorEmail } },
    },
  })
  res.json(result)
})
```

### 3.4. Adjusting the `/publish/:id` route (`PUT`)

With the Prisma Client 2.0 API, the `/publish/:id` route for `PUT` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.put('/publish/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.post.update({
    where: { id },
    data: { published: true },
  })
  res.json(post)
})
```

### 3.5. Adjusting the `/post/:id` route (`DELETE`)

With the Prisma Client 2.0 API, the `//post/:id` route for `DELETE` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.delete(`/post/:id`, async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.post.delete({ 
    where: { id }
   })
  res.json(post)
})
```

### 3.6. Adjusting the `/post/:id` route (`GET`)

With the Prisma Client 2.0 API, the `/post/:id` route for `GET` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.get(`/post/:id`, async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const post = await prisma.post.findOne({ 
    where: { id }
   })
  res.json(post)
})
```

### 3.7. Adjusting the `/feed` route (`GET`)

With the Prisma Client 2.0 API, the `/feed` route for `GET` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.get('/feed', async (req, res) => {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({ where: { published: true } })
  res.json(posts)
})
```

### 3.8. Adjusting the `/filterPosts` route (`GET`)

With the Prisma Client 2.0 API, the `/user` route for `POST` requests has to be changed to:

```ts
app.get('/filterPosts', async (req, res) => {
  const { searchString } = req.query
  const filteredPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
    where: {
      OR: [
        {
          title: { contains: searchString }
        },
        {
          content: { contains: searchString }
        },
      ],
    },
  })
  res.json(filteredPosts)
})
```

## 4. Performing database migrations with Prisma Migrate

Going forward, you won't perform schema migrations using the `prisma deploy` command any more. Instead, you can use the `prisma migrate` commands. Every schema migration follows a 3-step-process:

1. Adjust the data model inside your Prisma schema to reflect the desired change (e.g. adding a new model)
1. Run `npx prisma migrate save --experimental` to save the migration on your file system (this doesn't perform the migration yet)
1. Run `npx prisma migrate up --experimental` to actually perform the migration against your database

> **Warning**: Prisma Migrate is currently in an **experimental** state. When using any of the commands below, you need to explicitly opt-in via an `--experimental` flag, e.g. `prisma migrate save --name 'init' --experimental`.

## Summary

In this upgrade guide, you learned how to upgrade an Express-based REST API from Prisma 1 to Prisma 2.0 that uses Prisma Client 2.0 and Prisma Migrate. In the future, we'll cover more fine-grained upgrade scenarios, based on more complicated database schemas as well as for projects that are using GraphQL Nexus and `nexus-prisma`.
