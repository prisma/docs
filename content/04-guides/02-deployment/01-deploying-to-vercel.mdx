## Overview

In this guide, you will set up and deploy a serverless Node.js application to [Vercel (Formerly Zeit Now)](https://vercel.com/home). The application will expose a REST API and use Prisma Client to handle fetching, creating, and deleting records from a database.

Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. Typically Vercel integrates with a Git repository for automatic deployments upon commits. For the sake of simplicity, this guide uses the Vercel CLI which allows deploying directly from the command line.

The application has the following components:

- **Backend**: Serverless Node.js REST API with resource endpoints that use Prisma Client to handle database operations against a PostgreSQL database (e.g. hosted on Heroku).
- **Frontend**: Static HTML page to interact with the API.

The focus of this guide is showing how Prisma integrates with Vercel. The starting point will the [Prisma Vercel example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/deployment-platforms/vercel) which has a couple of REST endpoints preconfigured as serverless functions and a static page.

> Throughout the guide you'll find various **checkpoints** that enable you to validate whether you performed the steps correctly.

## Prerequisites

- Hosted PostgreSQL database and a URL from which it can be accessed, e.g. `postgresql://username:password@your_postgres_db.cloud.com/db_identifier` (you can use Heroku, which offers a [free plan](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1)).
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account.
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) installed.
- Node.js installed.
- PostgreSQL CLI `psql` installed.

## Prisma workflow

Prisma supports different workflows depending on whether you integrate with an existing database or create a new one from scratch. Regardless of the workflow, Prisma relies on the Prisma schema, i.e. `schema.prisma` file.

This guide starts with an empty database created with plain SQL and looks as follows:

1. Define the database schema using SQL.
1. Run `prisma introspect` which will introspect and populate the `prisma.schema` with models based on the database schema
1. Run `prisma generate` which will generate Prisma Client based on the Prisma schema.

## 1. Download the example and install dependencies

Open your terminal and navigate to a location of your choice. Create the directory that will hold the application code and download the example code:

```terminal
mkdir prisma-vercel
cd prisma-vercel
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=3 prisma-examples-latest/deployment-platforms/vercel/
```

<!-- tar strip folder is a concatenation of the REPOSITORY-BRANCH/REF, e.g. prisma-examples-latest -->

**Checkpoint:** `ls -1` should show:

```terminal
ls -1
README.md
api
vercel.json
package.json
prisma
public
schema.sql
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## 2. Vercel login

Make sure you're logged in to Vercel with the CLI:

```terminal
vercel login
```

This will allow you to deploy to Vercel from the terminal.

**Checkpoint:** `vercel whoami` should show your username:

```terminal
vercel whoami
Vercel CLI 19.0.1
> your-username
```

## 3. Create the database schema

To create your database schema, run the `schema.sql` from the example code as follows:

```terminal
psql postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__ -f schema.sql
```

Note that the long string starting with `postgresql://` will be referred to as the `DATABASE_URL` which you'll also need for the subsequent steps. You need to replace the uppercase placeholders with your database credentials, e.g.:

```terminal
psql postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@yourpostgres.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/yourdbname -f schema.sql
```

**Checkpoint:** `psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt"` should show the list of tables:

```terminal
          List of relations
 Schema | Name    | Type  | Owner
 --------+---------+-------+-----------
 public | Post    | table | janedoe
 public | Profile | table | janedoe
 public | User    | table | janedoe
```

Congratulations, you have successfully created the database schema.

## 4. Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable locally so that Prisma can access the database to introspect:

```terminal
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__"
```

It's considered best practice to keep secrets out of your codebase. If you open up the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, you should see `env("DATABASE_URL")` in the _datasource_ block. By setting an environment variable you keep secrets out of the codebase.

## 5. Introspect the database

Introspect the database with the Prisma CLI:

```terminal
npx prisma introspect
```

Prisma will introspect the database defined in the `datasource` block of the Prisma schema and populate the Prisma schema with models corresponding to the database tables.

**Checkpoint:** `prisma/schema.prisma` should look as follows (note that the fields on the models have been reordered for better readability):

```prisma
model Post {
  post_id   Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title     String
  content   String?
  author_id Int?
  User      User?   @relation(fields: [author_id], references: [user_id])
}

model Profile {
  profile_id Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  bio        String?
  user_id    Int
  User       User    @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [user_id])
}

model User {
  user_id Int       @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name    String?
  email   String    @unique
  Post    Post[]
  Profile Profile[]
}
```

### Rename the relation fields for easy access

Because both the generated `Post` and `Profile` fields in the `User` model are _virtual_ (i.e. they're _not backed by a foreign key in the database_), you can manually rename them in your Prisma schema. This will only affect the generated client and is typically done so that they have a more meaningful name in the context of the relation.

In the resulting Prisma schema there are two types of relation fields:

- Relation fields: identified by having a Model name as the type, e.g. the `User` field in the `Post` model. Can be renamed to better fit its usage, e.g. `User` -> `author`.
- [Relation scalar fields](../..//reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations): these are used to store the foreign key, e.g. the `authorId` field in the `Post` model. Cannot be rename as it must match the field in the database.

The names of the relation fields are used in the client to access those relations for example, fetching a specific `Post` and its associated `User` object would as follows with the Prisma schema above:

```js
const postAuthor = await prisma.post.findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: { User: true },
})
```

If you rename the `User` field in the `Post` model to `author`, you'll be able to access it as follows:

```js
const postAuthor = await prisma.post.findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: { author: true },
})
```

Based on that logic, rename the relation fields to better adhere to the [naming conventions](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/prisma-schema-reference#naming-conventions-1) <span class="api"></span>:

```prisma
model Post {
  post_id   Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  content   String?
  title     String
  author_id Int?
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [author_id], references: [user_id]) // renamed from `User` -> `author`
}

model Profile {
  bio        String?
  profile_id Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  user_id    Int
  user       User    @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [user_id]) // renamed from `User` -> `user`
}

model User {
  email     String    @unique
  name      String?
  user_id   Int       @default(autoincrement()) @id
  posts     Post[]    // renamed from `Post` -> `posts`
  profiles  Profile[] // renamed from `Profile` -> `profiles`
}
```

## 6. Define Vercel secret and expose to functions

In step 4 you set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable on your machine. For the application to work, `DATABASE_URL` also needs to be available to Vercel's serverless functions.

Adding environment variables to Vercel requires two steps:

1. Defining a [Vercel secret](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/secrets) via the Vercel CLI with `vercel secrets add`.
2. Exposing the secret to your serverless functions in your `vercel.json` file.

```terminal
vercel secrets add database_url "$DATABASE_URL"
```

This uses the `$DATABASE_URL` environment variable defined in step 4.

Using the `vercel.json` configuration file, you can set Vercel related configuration, such as routing and environment variables. The `vercel.json` from the example will contain the configuration for making the secret available as an environment variable:

```json
// vercel.json
{
  // ...
  "env": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "@database_url"
  },
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "DATABASE_URL": "@database_url"
    }
  }
}
```

The configuration exposes the Vercel secret `database_url` as an environment variable named `DATABASE_URL` to both the build and run time. Prisma will use `DATABASE_URL` to connect to your database whenever the functions run.

## 7. Deploy to Vercel

Deploy the app from the project's root:

```terminal
vercel
```

After prompting you to pick a Vercel project name, it will deploy the app and log the preview URL.

**Checkpoint:** Make a request to the preview URL's API root:

```terminal
curl https://PROJECT_NAME.NOW_USERNAME.now.sh/api
```

The call should return: `{"up":true}`

## 8. Test your deployed application

You can use the static frontend to interact with the API you deployed via the preview URL.

Open up the preview URL in your browser, the URL should like this: `https://PROJECT_NAME.NOW_USERNAME.now.sh`. You should see the following:

![deployed-screenshot](https://imgur.com/y7yGDAb.pngs)

The four buttons allow you to make requests to the REST API and view the response:

- **Check API status**: Will call the REST API status endpoint that returns `{"up":true}`. The implementation code is in `api/index.js`
- **Seed data**: Will delete all database records and load the database with test data `users`, `profiles`, and `posts`. Returns the created users. The implementation code is in `api/seed.js`
- **Load users with profiles**: Will load all `users` in the database with their related `profiles`. The implementation code is in `api/getUsers.js`
- **Load Posts**: Will load `posts` and their related `authors`. The implementation code is in `api/getPosts.js`

For example, calling seed data should show the following:

![deployed-seed-endpoint-screenshot](https://imgur.com/mThW4Na.png)

## Notes

The `package.json` uses the `postinstall` hook script to run `prisma generate`.
Typically this would go in the `build` step. Because Vercel caches `node_modules` after the dependencies are installed, the functions won't have access to the generated Prisma Client.
Generating the Prisma Client in `postinstall` ensures that the generated Prisma Client in `node_modules/@prisma/client` is available to the functions.

## Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the application to Vercel.

For more insight into Prisma Client's API, look at the function handlers in the `api/` folder.

Generally, when using a FaaS (function as a service) environment to interact with a database, it's beneficial to pool DB connections for performance reasons. This is because every function invocation may result in a new connection to the database (this is not a problem with a constantly running node.js server). For more information on some of the solutions, you may want to look at our [general FaaS guide](/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/deployment#serverless-faas).
