## Overview

In this guide, you will set up and deploy a serverless Node.js application to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The application will expose a REST API and use Prisma Client to handle fetching, creating, and deleting records from a database.

Netlify is a cloud platform for continuous deployment, static sites, and serverless functions. Netlify integrates seamlessly with GitHub for automatic deployments upon commits. In this guide, you will use this approach to create a CI/CD pipeline that deploys your application from a GitHub repository.

The application has the following components:

- **Backend**: Serverless Node.js REST API with resource endpoints that use Prisma Client to handle database operations against a PostgreSQL database (e.g. hosted on Heroku).
- **Frontend**: Static HTML page to interact with the API.

![architecture diagram](https://i.imgur.com/ybRH5wH.png)

The focus of this guide is showing how Prisma integrates with Netlify. The starting point will the [Prisma Netlify example](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-netlify) which has a couple of REST endpoints preconfigured as serverless functions and a static HTML page.

With Netlify, the fundamental building block is a [**Site**](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/). Sites are typically connected to a Git repository and have a publicly accessible URL that looks like `https://site-name.netlify.com`. In this guide, you will connect a Github repository to a Netlify site.

> Throughout the guide you'll find various **checkpoints** that enable you to validate whether you performed the steps correctly.

## Prerequisites

- Github account
- Hosted PostgreSQL database and a URL from which it can be accessed, e.g. `postgresql://username:password@your_postgres_db.cloud.com/db_identifier` (you can use Heroku, which offers a [free plan](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1)).
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup) account connected to your Github account (Netlify will need access to the repository you will create as part of this guide).
- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) installed.
- Node.js installed.
- PostgreSQL CLI `psql` installed.

## Prisma workflow

Prisma supports different workflows depending on whether you integrate with an existing database or create a new one from scratch. Regardless of the workflow, Prisma relies on the Prisma schema, i.e. `schema.prisma` file.

This guide starts with an empty database created with plain SQL and looks as follows:

1. Define the database schema using SQL.
1. Run `prisma introspect` locally which will introspect and populate the `schema.prisma` with models based on the database schema.
1. Run `prisma generate` which will generate Prisma Client based on the Prisma schema.

## 1. Fork the `deployment-example-netlify` repository

Go to [`deployment-example-netlify`](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-netlify) and **Fork** the repository by clicking on the fork button on the top right corner:

![fork button](https://i.imgur.com/nyap5pW.png)

By forking, you create a copy of the repository to which you will be able to commit your changes. Later in the guide, you will connect the forked repository to Netlify so that changes are automatically built and deployed.

**Checkpoint:** After cloning you should see the forked repository in your account, i.e. https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/deployment-example-netlify

## 2. Clone the fork and install dependencies

Open your terminal, navigate to a location of your choice and clone your fork of the `deployment-example-netlify`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/deployment-example-netlify.git
```

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies:

```sh
cd deployment-example-netlify
npm install
```

**Checkpoint:** `ls -1` should show:

```sh
ls -1
README.md
functions
netlify.toml
node_modules
package.json
prisma
public
schema.sql
```

## 3. Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable locally

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable locally so you can create the database schema and Prisma can access the database to introspect:

```sh
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__"
```

> **Note:** you will need the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for the subsequent steps. Set it in all terminal sessions related to this project.

You need to replace the uppercase placeholders with your database credentials, e.g.:

```sh
postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@yourpostgres.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/yourdbname
```

## 4. Create the database schema

To create your database schema, run the `schema.sql` from the example code as follows:

```sh
psql $DATABASE_URL -f schema.sql
```

**Checkpoint:** `psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt"` should show the list of tables:

```text
      List of relations
Schema |  Name   | Type  |     Owner
--------+---------+-------+----------------
public | Post    | table | janedoe
public | Profile | table | janedoe
public | User    | table | janedoe
```

Congratulations, you have successfully created the database schema.

## 5. Introspect the database

Introspect the database with the Prisma CLI:

```sh
npx prisma introspect
```

Prisma will introspect the database defined in the `datasource` block of the Prisma schema and populate the Prisma schema with models corresponding to the database tables.

**Checkpoint:** Open `prisma/schema.prisma` and ensure there are three models: `Post`, `Profile`, and `User`.

## 6. Commit the Prisma schema to the repository

The result of `prisma introspect` is the `schema.prisma` Prisma schema file.

Since the Prisma schema is used to generate Prisma Client, commit it to your repository so that Prisma Client can be generated when Netlify builds the project:

```sh
git commit prisma/schema.prisma -m 'Add Prisma schema'
```

## 7. Netlify login

Make sure you're logged in to Netlify with the CLI:

```sh
netlify login
```

This will allow you to create a Netlify site and connect it to a repository from the terminal.

**Checkpoint:** `netlify status` should show your username:

```sh
netlify status
──────────────────────┐
 Current Netlify User │
──────────────────────┘
Name: your name
Email: your@email.com
Teams:
  ....
```

## 8. Configure continuous deployment to Netlify

From the repository's folder, run `netlify init` to configure a new Netlify site:

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ctt56FN.png)

You will be prompted with configuration options:

1. Select `Create & configure a new site`
2. If prompted to select your team, pick the one in which Netlify will create the site
3. Give the site a unique name
4. _Your build command_: `npm run build`
5. _Directory to deploy_: `public`

**Checkpoint:** The Netlify CLI should output the following:

```text
Site Created

Admin URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_SITE_NAME
URL:       https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.com
```

> **Note:** You can change the build configuration via the `netlify.toml` file and the site name from the Netlify admin UI.

### Enable Netlify Build Plugins Beta

Due to a bug with the Prisma engine binary not getting packaged for deployment to Lambda, it is necessary to enable the [Netlify Build Plugins Beta](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#enable-build-plugins-beta).

To do so, go to https://app.netlify.com/enable-beta and enable it for the site you just deployed.

## 9. Expose the DATABASE_URL environment variable to functions

Since Prisma will connect to the database from your serverless functions, you need to expose the `DATABASE_URL` to the backend functions. This is typically done from the Netlify UI. To do, open the Netlify admin UI for the site. You can do so directly with the Netlify CLI as follows:

```sh
netlify open --admin
```

Once open, go to **Site settings**:

![Netlify admin UI](https://i.imgur.com/p472v73.png)

Navigate to **Build & deploy** in the sidebar on the left and then select **Environment**:

![Netlify environment variables](https://i.imgur.com/UJc23f8.png)

Create a variable with the key `DATABASE_URL` and set the value with your PostgresSQL URL.

> **Note:** It's considered best practice to keep secrets out of your codebase. If you open up the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, you should see `env("DATABASE_URL")` in the _datasource_ block. By setting an environment variable you keep secrets out of the codebase.

## 10. Deploy the app

Your project is now ready for deployment

You can now use `git push` to push the commit with the Prisma schema. This will trigger a netlify build.

**Checkpoint:** Call the API status endpoint:

```sh
curl https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/status
```

The call should return: `{"up":true}`

## 11. Test your deployed application

Open the site from the command line:

```sh
netlify open:site
```

This will open the static frontend that you deployed.
The URL should like this: `https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.com`.

![deployed-screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/RnaHMS3.png)

The four buttons allow you to make requests to the REST API and view the response:

- **Check API status**: Will call the REST API status endpoint that returns `{"up":true}`. The implementation code is in `functions/index.js`
- **Seed data**: Will delete all database records and load the database with test data `users`, `profiles`, and `posts`. Returns the created users. The implementation code is in `functions/seed.js`
- **Load users with profiles**: Will load all `users` in the database with their related `profiles`. The implementation code is in `functions/getUsers.js`
- **Load Posts**: Will load `posts` and their related `authors`. The implementation code is in `functions/getPosts.js`

For example, calling seed data should show the following:

![deployed-screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/dOJUBsv.png)

## Notes

The `netlify.toml` file defines a build time environment variable called `ZISI_VERSION`.
This sets a specific version of [zip-it-and-ship-it](https://github.com/netlify/zip-it-and-ship-it) which fixes a [bug](https://github.com/netlify/zip-it-and-ship-it/issues/81) related to the way Prisma loads its dependencies.

## Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the application to Netlify.

For more insight into Prisma Client's API, look at the function handlers in the `functions/` folder.

Generally, when using a FaaS (function as a service) environment to interact with a database, it's beneficial to pool DB connections for performance reasons. This is because every function invocation may result in a new connection to the database (this is not a problem with a constantly running node.js server). For more information on some of the solutions, you may want to look at our [general FaaS guide](/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/deployment#serverless-faas).
