## Overview

This page explains the first step of your upgrade process: Taking your Prisma 1 configuration and upgrading it to Prisma 2.0. Concretely, you will learn how to:

1. Add the Prisma 2.0 CLI as a development dependency
1. Create your Prisma 2.0 schema
1. Determine your connection URL and connect to your database
1. Introspect your database (that was so far managed with Prisma 1)
1. Use the [Prisma Upgrade CLI](./how-to-upgrade#prisma-upgrade-cli) to resolve the [schema incompatibilities](./schema-incompatibilities) in the new Prisma 2.0 data model
1. Install and generate Prisma Client

Once done with these steps, you can move on to the next guide that explains how you can upgrade the application layer to use Prisma Client for your database queries.

> **Note**: During the upgrade process it can be helpful to get a graphical view on your database. It is therefore recommended to use a graphical database client to connect to your database, such as [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) or [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/).

## 1. Install Prisma 2.0 CLI 

The Prisma 2.0 CLI is available as the [`@prisma/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/cli) package on npm and is invoked via the `prisma` command.

Note that the former `prisma` command for Prisma 1 has been renamed to `prisma1`. You can learn more about this [here](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-2-beta-b7bcl0gd8d8e/#renaming-the-prisma2-cli).

You can install the Prisma 2.0 CLI in your Node.js project as follows (be sure to invoke this command in the directory where your `package.json` is located):

```copy
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
```

> **Note**: With Prisma 1, it was usually recommended to install the CLI globally. We now recommend to [install the Prisma CLI locally](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-cli/installation#local-installation-recommended) to prevent version conflicts.

You can now use the local installation of the `prisma` CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```
npx prisma
```

If you're upgrading your entire project [all at once](./how-to-upgrade#upgrade-strategies), you can now also uninstall the Prisma 1 CLI (otherwise expand below):

```
# remove global installation
npm uninstall -g prisma

# remove local installation
npm uninstall prisma
```

<br />
<details><summary>Expand if you want to keep using your Prisma 1 CLI side-by-side</summary>

If you want to keep using the Prisma 1 CLI, it is recommend to remove your global installation of it and add the `prisma1` CLI as a development dependency:

```
# installs v1.34 of the Prisma 1 CLI
npm uninstall -g prisma
npm install prisma1 --save-dev
```

You can now invoke it as follows:

```
npx prisma1
```

Note that if you need a CLI version smaller than 1.34 (e.g. 1.30), you can install it as follows:

```
# installs v1.30 of the Prisma 1 CLI
npm uninstall -g prisma@1.30
npm install prisma@1.30 --save-dev
```

You can now invoke it as follows:

```
npx prisma
```

Because the CLI command of this version is identical to the Prisma 2 CLI command (in both cases, it's just `prisma`), there might be [name clashes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2433) between the two. You might have to uninstall the `@prisma/cli` package if you want to run Prisma 1 commands.

</details>

## 2. Create your Prisma 2.0 schema

For this guide, you'll first create a new Prisma schema using the `prisma init` command and then "fill" it with a data model using [introspection](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/introspection).

Run the following command to create your Prisma schema (note that this throws an error if you already have a folder called `prisma`):

```copy
npx prisma init
```

If you're seeing the following error, you need to rename your current `prisma` directory:

```bash
$ npx prisma init
 ERROR  A folder called prisma already exists in your project.
        Please try again in a project that is not yet using Prisma.
```

You can rename the current `prisma` directory to `prisma1` to make it clear that this holds the former Prisma 1 configuration:

```bash copy
mv prisma prisma1
```

Now you can run `init` and it will succeed:

```copy
npx prisma init
```

It should print the following output:

```
$ npx prisma init
                

✔ Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma.
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

Next steps:
1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started.
2. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql or sqlite.
3. Run prisma introspect to turn your database schema into a Prisma data model.
4. Run prisma generate to install Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

More information in our documentation:
https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
```

The command created a new folder called `prisma` with two files:

- `schema.prisma`: Your Prisma schema file that specifies the [data source](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-sources), [generator](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/generators) and [data model](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model) (note that the data model doesn't exist yet, it will be generated via introspection).
- `.env`: A [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme) file to configure your database [connection URL](../../../reference/database-connectors/connection-urls).

Your initial Prisma schema looks as follows:

```prisma
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

With Prisma 1, you specify which language variant of the Prisma client you wanted to use in your `prisma.yml`. With Prisma 2.0, this information is now specified inside the Prisma schema via a `generator` block. 

> **Note**: Unlike Prisma 1, the TypeScript and JavaScript variants of Prisma Client 2.0 use the _same_ generator called `prisma-client-js`. The generated types in `index.d.ts` are _always_ included, even in plain JavaScript projects. This enables feature like autocompletion in VS Code even when not using TypeScript.

## 3. Determine your connection URL and connect to your database

With Prisma 1, the database connection is configured in the Docker Compose file that's used to launch the Prisma server. The Prisma server then exposes a GraphQL endpoint (via HTTP) that proxies all database requests from the Prisma client application code. That HTTP endpoint is specified in your `prisma.yml`.

With Prisma 2.0, the HTTP layer isn't exposed any more and Prisma Client 2.0 is configured to run requests "directly" against the database (that is, requests are proxied by Prisma's [query engine](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/query-engine), but there isn't an extra server any more).

So, as a next step you'll need to tell Prisma 2.0 _what_ kind of database you use (MySQL or PostgreSQL) and _where_ it is located.

First, you need to ensure that that `provider` field on the `datasource` block inside `schema.prisma` is configured to use the right database:

- If you're using PostgreSQL, it needs to define the value `"postgresql"` in the `provider` field. 
- If you're using MySQL, it needs to define the value `"mysql"` in the `provider` field.

Switch around with the tabs in the code block to see examples of both:

<CodeBlock languages={["PostgreSQL", "MySQL"]}>

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

</CodeBlock>

With the `provider` field set, you can go ahead and configure the connection URL inside the `.env` file. 

Assume the database configuration in your Docker Compose file that you used to deploy your Prisma server looks as follows:

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'postgresql']}>

```yml
PRISMA_CONFIG: |
  port: 4466
  databases:
    default:
      connector: postgres
      host: postgres
      port: 5432
      user: prisma
      password: prisma
```

Also assume your `endpoint` in `prisma.yml` is configured as follows:

```yml
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/myproject/dev
```

Based on these connection details, you need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable inside your `.env` file as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/prisma?schema=myproject$dev"
```

Note that the `schema` argument is typically composed of your _service name_ and _service stage_ (which are part of the `endpoint` in `prisma.yml`), separated by the `$` character. 

Sometimes no service name and stage are specified in `prisma.yml`:

```
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/
```

In that case, the `schema` must be specified as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/prisma?schema=default$default"
```

</SwitchTech>

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'mysql']}>

```yml
PRISMA_CONFIG: |
  port: 4466
  databases:
    default:
      connector: mysql
      host: mysql
      port: 3306
      user: root
      password: randompassword
```

Also assume your `endpoint` in `prisma.yml` is configured as follows:

```yml
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/myproject/dev
```

Based on these connection details, you need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable inside your `.env` file as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:randompassword@localhost:3306/myproject@dev"
```

Note that the _database name_ in the connection string is typically composed of your _service name_ and _service stage_ (which are part of the `endpoint` in `prisma.yml`), separated by the `@` character. 

Sometimes no service name and stage are specified in `prisma.yml`:

```
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/
```

In that case, the database name must be specified as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:randompassword@localhost:5432/default@default"
```

</SwitchTech>

```

</details> -->

Learn more on the [Connection URLs](../../../reference/database-connectors/connection-urls) page.

## 4. Introspect your database

For the purpose of this guide, we'll use the following Prisma 1 data model (select the **SQL** tab below to see what the data model maps to in SQL):

<CodeBlock languages={["Prisma 1 datamodel", "SQL"]}>

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  email: String @unique
  name: String!
  role: Role! @default(value: CUSTOMER)
  jsonData: Json 
  profile: Profile
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
  title: String!
  content: String
  published: Boolean! @default(value: false)
  author: User @relation(link: TABLE)
  categories: [Category!]!
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @id
  bio: String
  user: User! @relation(link: INLINE)
}

type Category {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

enum Role {
  ADMIN
  CUSTOMER
}
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE"User" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    email text,
    name text NOT NULL,
    role text NOT NULL,
    "jsonData" text
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "User_pkey" ON"User"(id text_ops);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "default$default.User.email._UNIQUE" ON"User"(email text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"Post" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    title text NOT NULL,
    published boolean NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" timestamp(3) without time zone NOT NULL,
    "updatedAt" timestamp(3) without time zone NOT NULL,
    content text
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Post_pkey" ON"Post"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"Profile" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    bio text,
    user character varying(25) REFERENCES"User"(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Profile_pkey" ON"Profile"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"Category" (
    id character varying(25) PRIMARY KEY,
    name text NOT NULL
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Category_pkey" ON"Category"(id text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"_PostToUser" (
    "A" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"Post"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "B" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"User"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "_PostToUser_AB_unique" ON"_PostToUser"("A" text_ops,"B" text_ops);
CREATE INDEX "_PostToUser_B" ON"_PostToUser"("B" text_ops);

CREATE TABLE"_CategoryToPost" (
    "A" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"Category"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "B" character varying(25) NOT NULL REFERENCES"Post"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_AB_unique" ON"_CategoryToPost"("A" text_ops,"B" text_ops);
CREATE INDEX "_CategoryToPost_B" ON"_CategoryToPost"("B" text_ops);
```

</CodeBlock>

Note that this data model has three [relations](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations):

- 1-1: `User` ↔ `Profile`
- 1-n: `User` ↔ `Post`  (maintained via the `_PostToUser` relation table)
- m-n: `Post` ↔ `Category` (maintained via the `_CategoryToPost` relation table)

Now you can run Prisma's introspection against your database with the following command:

``` copy
npx prisma introspect
```

Here's a graphical illustration for what happens when `introspect` is invoked:

![](https://imgur.com/f7itiYw.png)

For the above Prisma 1 datamodel, this results in the following Prisma 2.0 schema (note that the models and fields have been reorded to match the initial order of the Prisma 1 datamodel):

```prisma
model User {
  id       String    @default(cuid()) @id
  email    String?   @unique
  name     String
  role     String
  jsonData String?
  Profile  Profile[]
  Post     Post[]    @relation(references: [id])
}

model Post {
  id        String     @default(cuid()) @id
  createdAt DateTime
  updatedAt DateTime
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean
  User      User[]     @relation(references: [id])
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  id   String  @default(cuid()) @id
  bio  String?
  user String?
  User User?   @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
}

model Category {
  id   String @default(cuid()) @id
  name String
  Post Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

While this is already a valid Prisma 2.0 schema, it lacks a number of _features_ that were part of its Prisma 1 equivalent:

- no auto-generated date values for the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields on `Post`
- no default value for the `role` field on `User`
- no default value for the `published` field on `Post`

There further are a number of inconsistencies which result in a less idiomatic/ergonomic Prisma Client API:

- `User` ↔ `Profile` is a 1-n instead of 1-1 relation
- `User` ↔ `Post` is a m-n instead of 1-n relation
- relation fields are uppercased (e.g. `Profile` and `Post` on `User`)
- the `jsonData` field on `User` is of type `String` instead of `Json`
- the `role` field on `User` is of type `String` instead of `Role`, the `enum` definition for role is missing altogether

While these inconsistencies don't actually impact the "feature set" you'll have available in your Prisma Client API, they make you lose certain constraints/guarantees that were present before. 

For example, Prisma now won't guarantee that a `User` is connected to _at most_ one `Profile` because the relation between the tables was recognized as 1-n during introspection, so one `User` record _could_ now get connected to multiple `Profile` records. 

Another issue is that you can store whatever text for the `jsonData` and `role` fields, regardless of whether it's valid JSON or represents a value of the `Role` enum.

To learn more about these inconsistencies check out the [Schema incompatibilities](./schema-incompatibilities) page.

In the following, we'll go through these incompatibilities and fix them one by one using the Prisma schema upgrade CLI.

## 5. Use the Prisma schema upgrade CLI to resolve schema incompatibilities

The [Prisma Upgrade CLI](./how-to-upgrade#prisma-upgrade-cli) is an interactive tool that helps you upgrading your Prisma schema and ironing out most of the inconsistencies listed above.

The Prisma Upgrade CLI works in two major phases:

1. Fix the database schema via plain SQL
1. Add missing attributes to the Prisma 2.0 schema and other schema fixes

During the first phase, it will generate and print a number of SQL statements that you should run against your database to adjust the database schema. You can either run all of the statements or a subset of them before continuing to the second phase.

During the second phase, you don't need to do anything manually. The Upgrade CLI will make changes to your Prisma schema by adding certain Prisma-level attributes (like `@default(cuid))` or `@updatedAt`), adjusting the names of relation fields to match the ones from your Prisma 1 datamodel and ensure 1-1-relations that were required on both sides in your Prisma 1 datamodel are also required in the Prisma 2.0 schema.

Note that **you can start over at any time during the process** and go back from the second to the first phase.

In this illustration, the green area shows the first phase, the blue area shows the second phase. Note that you can optionally run `prisma introspect` in between the phases to update your Prisma data model:

![](https://imgur.com/bsFu8HD.png)

To use the Upgrade CLI, you can either install it locally in your project, or invoke it once without installation using `npx` as done here:

```
npx prisma-upgrade prisma1/prisma.yml prisma/schema.prisma
```

The CLI will greet you with the following message:

```
npx prisma-upgrade prisma1/prisma.yml prisma/schema.prisma

◮ Welcome to the interactive Prisma Upgrade CLI that helps with the
upgrade process from Prisma 1 to Prisma 2.0.

Please read the docs to learn more about the upgrade process:
https://pris.ly/d/how-to-upgrade

➤ Goal
The Upgrade CLI helps you resolve the schema incompatibilities
betweeen Prisma 1 and Prisma 2.0. Learn more in the docs:
https://pris.ly/d/schema-incompatibilities

➤ How it works
Troughout the process, you'll need to adjust your database schema by sending
SQL statements to it. The SQL statements are provided by the Upgrade CLI.

Note that the Upgrade CLI never makes changes to your database,
you are in full control over any operations that are executed against it.

You can stop and re-run the Upgrade CLI at any time.

These are the different steps of the upgrade process:

  1. The Upgrade CLI generates SQL commands for you to run on your database.
  2. You run the SQL commands against your database.
  3. You run the `npx prisma introspect` command again.
  4. You run the `npx prisma-upgrade` command again.
  5. The Upgrade CLI adjusts the Prisma 2 schema by adding missing attributes.

➤ Note
It is recommended that you make a full backup of your existing data before starting
the upgrade process. If possible, the migration should be performed in a staging
environment before executed against a production environment.

➤ Help
If you have any questions or run into any problems along the way,
please create an issue at:
https://github.com/prisma/upgrade/issues/new
    
Are you ready? [Y/n] 
```

Press the <kbd>Y</kbd> button, then confirm by hitting <kbd>RETURN</kbd> on your keyboard to continue.

Once you confirmed, the CLI outputs the SQL statements you should be running against your database:

```
➤ Adjust your database schema
Run the following SQL statements against your database:

  Fix columns with ENUM data types
  https://pris.ly/d/schema-incompatibilities#enums-are-represented-as-text-in-database

    CREATE TYPE "dr4$dev"."Role" AS ENUM ('ADMIN', 'CUSTOMER');
    ALTER TABLE "dr4$dev"."User" ALTER COLUMN "role" SET DATA TYPE "dr4$dev"."Role" using "role"::"dr4$dev"."Role";


  Add missing `DEFAULT` constraints to the database
  https://pris.ly/d/schema-incompatibilities#default-values-arent-represented-in-database

    ALTER TABLE "dr4$dev"."User" ALTER COLUMN "role" SET DEFAULT 'CUSTOMER';
    ALTER TABLE "dr4$dev"."Post" ALTER COLUMN "published" SET DEFAULT false;


  Fix columns with JSON data types
  https://pris.ly/d/schema-incompatibilities#json-type-is-represented-as-text-in-database

    ALTER TABLE "dr4$dev"."User" ALTER COLUMN "jsonData" SET DATA TYPE JSONB USING "jsonData"::TEXT::JSONB;


  Replicate `@createdAt` behavior in Prisma 2.0
  https://pris.ly/d/schema-incompatibilities#createdat-isnt-represented-in-database

    ALTER TABLE "dr4$dev"."Post" ALTER COLUMN "createdAt" SET DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;


  Fix 1-1 relations by adding `UNIQUE` constraints
  https://pris.ly/d/schema-incompatibilities#inline-1-1-relations-are-recognized-as-1-n-missing-unique-constraint

    ALTER TABLE "dr4$dev"."Profile" ADD UNIQUE ("user");



➤ Next Steps

After you executed one or more of the above SQL statements against your database,
please run the following two commands to refresh your Prisma 2 Schema and check
the changes.

  1. Run `npx prisma introspect` again to refresh your Prisma 2 schema.
  2. Run `npx prisma-upgrade` again.

If you can't or don't want to execute the remaining SQL statements right now, you can
skip to the last step where the Upgrade CLI adds missing attributes to your Prisma 2
schema that are not picked up by introspection.
    
Skip to the last step? [Y/n]? 
```

The shown SQL statements fall are categorized into five buckets, all aiming to resolve a certain [schema incompatibility](./schema-incompatibilities):

- Add missing `DEFAULT` constraints to the database
- Replicate `@createdAt` behavior in Prisma 2.0
- Fix 1-1 relations by adding `UNIQUE` constraints
- Fix columns with JSON data types
- Fix columns with ENUM data types

As a next step, you can start sending the SQL statements to your database. Note that all of these changes are non-breaking and you'll be able to continue using Prisma 1 side-by-side with Prisma 2.0.

The next sections cover the different kinds of SQL statements to be sent to your database individually.

### 5.1. Fix the database schema via plain SQL

### 5.1.1. Add missing `DEFAULT` constraints to the database

The first thing the tool does is help you resolve the issue that [default values aren't represented in the database](./schema-incompatibilities#default-values-arent-represented-in-database) by generating SQL statements that add the respective `DEFAULT` constraints directly to the database.

In this case, two `DEFAULT` constraints are missing which are suggested by the tool:

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'postgres']}>

```
Add missing `DEFAULT` constraints to the database
https://pris.ly/d/schema-incompatibilities#default-values-arent-represented-in-database

  ALTER TABLE "default$default"."Post" ALTER COLUMN "published" SET DEFAULT false;
```

Note that you need to [adjust](https://github.com/prisma/upgrade/issues/14) these statements before running them against your database: The table names need to be specified in double quotes and prefixed with the schema name (which should be specified in double quotes as well):

```sql
ALTER TABLE "default$default"."User" ALTER COLUMN role SET DEFAULT 'CUSTOMER';
ALTER TABLE "default$default"."Post" ALTER COLUMN published SET DEFAULT FALSE;
```

You can now run these SQL statements against your database either using a command line client or a GUI like Postico:

![](https://imgur.com/o4dJJic.png)

</SwitchTech>

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'mysql']}>

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's @default's to default values backed by the database. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE User CHANGE role role varchar(191) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'CUSTOMER';
  ALTER TABLE Post CHANGE published published tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

You can now run these SQL statements against your database either using a command line client or a GUI like TablePlus:

![](https://imgur.com/Qr7L1Nc.png)

</SwitchTech>

### 5.1.2. Replicate `@createdAt` behavior in Prisma 2.0

The next thing the tools does is help you resolve the issue that the behaviour of [`@createdAt` isn't represented in database](./schema-incompatibilities#default-values-arent-represented-in-database)

The CLI currently shows the following output:

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'postgres']}>

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's @createdAt to a datetime type with a default value of now. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE Post ALTER COLUMN createdAt SET DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

The CLI suggests to replicate the behaviour of `@createdAt` by adding another `DEFAULT` constraint with the value `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. After introspection, this will not be added as the `@createdAt` attribute, but as `@default(now())` in the new Prisma schema.

Note that you need to [adjust](https://github.com/prisma/upgrade/issues/14) these statements before running them against your database: The table and column names need to be specified in double quotes. Table names must also be prefixed with the schema name (which should be specified in double quotes as well):

```sql
ALTER TABLE "default$default"."Post" ALTER COLUMN "createdAt" SET DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

You can now run these SQL statements against your database either using a command line client or a GUI like Postico:

![](https://imgur.com/PvuQVkj.png)

</SwitchTech>

<SwitchTech technologies={['*', 'mysql']}>

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's @createdAt to a datetime type with a default value of now. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE Post CHANGE createdAt createdAt datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

The CLI suggests to replicate the behaviour of `@createdAt` by adding another `DEFAULT` constraint with the value `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. After introspection, this will not be added as the `@createdAt` attribute, but as `@default(now())` in the new Prisma schema.

Go ahead and run this statement against your database now.

</SwitchTech>

### 5.1.3. Fix 1-1 relations by adding `UNIQUE` constraints

Next, the tool will help you [turn the current 1-n relation between `User` ↔ `Profile`  back into a 1-1 relation](./schema-incompatibilities#inline-1-1-relations-are-recognized-as-1-n-missing-unique-constraint) by adding a `UNIQUE` constraint to the foreign key column called `user` (named after the relation field in the Prisma 1 datamodel) in the database.

The CLI currently shows the following output:

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's 1-to-1 relations with @relation or @relation(link:INLINE) to unique constraints on the database. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE Profile ADD UNIQUE (user);
```

Go ahead and run this statement against your database now.

### 5.1.4. Fix columns with JSON data types

Next, the tool helps you ensure that `Json` fields in your Prisma 1 datamodel will be represented as `JSON` columns in the underlying database, right now they are represented as plain strings (e.g. as `MEDIUMTEXT` in MySQL).

The CLI currently shows the following output:

```
Let's transition Prisma 1's Json type to a json type in the database. Run the following SQL command against your database:
      
  ALTER TABLE User CHANGE jsonData jsonData JSON;
```

Changing the column type to `JSON` will ensure that the field is properly recognized as `Json` during Prisma 2 introspection.

Go ahead and run this statement against your database now.

### 5.1.5. Fix columns with ENUM data types

Next, the tool helps you ensure that `enum` definitions in your Prisma 1 datamodel will be represented as actual `ENUM` types in the underlying database, right now they are represented as plain strings (e.g. as `MEDIUMTEXT` in MySQL).

The CLI currently shows the following output:

```
Fix columns with ENUM data types
https://pris.ly/d/schema-incompatibilities#enums-are-represented-as-text-in-database

  CREATE TYPE "default$default"."Role" AS ENUM ('ADMIN', 'CUSTOMER');
  ALTER TABLE "default$default"."User" ALTER COLUMN "role" SET DATA TYPE "default$default"."Role" using "role"::"default$default"."Role";
```

Go ahead and run this statement against your database now.

### 5.2. Add missing attributes to the Prisma 2.0 schema and other schema fixes

At this point, you either ran all the SQL statement that were printed by the CLI or you skipped some of them. Either way, you can now move on the last step and let the Upgrade CLI add the missing Prisma 2.0 attributes. Typically these are the following:

- `@default(cuid())` for your `@id` fields
- `@updatedAt` for any fields that were using this attribute in Prisma 1
- `@map` and `@@map` as replacements for `@db` and `@@db` from Prisma 1

In that step, the Upgrade CLI also fixes other issues that occured in the transition to Prisma 2.0:

- it makes sure that 1-1-relations that were required on both sides in Prisma 1 are also required in your Prisma 2.0 schema
- it renames relation fields to the same names they had in your Prisma 1 datamodel ([coming soon](https://github.com/prisma/upgrade/issues/25))

To apply these changes, hit the <kbd>Y</kbd> button and confirm by hitting <kbd>RETURN</kbd>.

### 5.3. Final result

The final version of the Prisma schema should look as follows:

```prisma
model Category {
  id   String @id
  name String
  Post Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Post {
  content   String?
  createdAt DateTime   @default(now())
  id        String     @id
  published Boolean    @default(false)
  title     String
  updatedAt DateTime   @default(now())
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
  User      User[]     @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  bio  String?
  id   String  @id
  user String? @unique
  User User?   @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
}

model User {
  email    String?  @unique
  id       String   @id
  jsonData Json?
  name     String
  role     String   @default("CUSTOMER")
  Profile  Profile?
  Post     Post[]   @relation(references: [id])
}
```

## 6. Manually resolve remaining schema incompatibilities

There are a few schema incompatibilities that were not yet resolved by the Prisma schema upgrade CLI.

Note that this guide will be continuously updated to incorporate the new [features](https://github.com/prisma/upgrade#current-features) of the upgrade CLI. For now, you can just follow the guide here and transfer the given SQL statements to your own setup.

### 6.2. Fix incorrect m-n relations

As a next step, you'll fix all 1-1 and 1-n relations that Prisma 1 represents with relation tables and that [currently only exist as m-n relations](./schema-incompatibilities#all-non-inline-relations-are-recognized-as-m-n) in your new Prisma 2.0 schema. Concretely, this is the case for the `User` ↔ `Post` relation which currently is defined as m-n but _should_ really be a 1-n relation. 

To fix this, you'll need to create a new foreign key column on `Post` to link directly to the `User` table. Then you'll need to migrate the foreign key values from the current relation table into the new foreign key column on `Post`. Finally, you can delete the relation table.

Here's the SQL statements for the sample data model from this guide:

For this fix, you'll need to run 3 SQL statements:

1. Create new column `authorId` on the `Post` table. This column should be a _foreign key_ that references the `id` field of the `User` table:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE `Post` ADD COLUMN `authorId` VARCHAR(25);
    ALTER TABLE `Post` ADD FOREIGN KEY (`authorId`) REFERENCES `User` (`id`);
    ```
1. Write a SQL query that reads all the rows from the `_PostToUser` relation table and for each row:
    1. Finds the respective `Post` record by looking up the value from column `A`
    1. Inserts the value from column `B` as the value for `authorId` into that `Post` record
    ```sql
    UPDATE Post, _PostToUser
    SET Post.authorId = _PostToUser.B
    WHERE Post.id = _PostToUser.A
    ```
1. Delete the `_PostToUser` relation table
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE `_PostToUser`;
    ```

After these commands, the user ID values of the records from column `B` of the relation table are migrated to the new `authorId` column.

### 6.3. Fix remaining issues

Note, at this point you still haven't fixed [scalar lists](./schema-incompatibilities#scalar-lists-arrays-are-maintained-with-extra-table) and [cascading deletes](./schema-incompatibilities#cascading-deletes-are-not-supported-in-prisma-20). You can find the recommended workarounds for these on the [Schema incompatibilities](./schema-incompatibilities) page. 

### 6.4. Introspect database

Assume these have been fixed, you can now run introspection again to generate your updated Prisma schema with proper enum support and the 1-n relation between `User` ↔ `Post`:

```
npx prisma introspect
```

This should be the result when you now introspect your database:

```prisma
model Category {
  id   String @id
  name String
  Post Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Post {
  authorId  String?
  content   String?
  createdAt DateTime   @default(now())
  id        String     @id
  published Boolean    @default(false)
  title     String
  updatedAt DateTime   @default(now())
  Category  Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  bio  String?
  id   String  @id
  user String? @unique
  User User?   @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
}

model User {
  email    String?    @unique
  id       String     @id
  jsonData Json?
  name     String
  role     User_role? @default(CUSTOMER)
  Profile  Profile?
}

enum User_role {
  ADMIN
  CUSTOMER
}
```

### 6.5. Rename relation fields

To make sure your Prisma Client queries feel natural and idiomatic, it's recommended to make a few adjustments to the Prisma in order to [configure your generated Prisma Client API](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/configuring-the-prisma-client-api).

Mostly, this means renaming [relation fields](../../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#relation-fields).

Because all relation fields are _virtual_, meaning they don't _manifest_ in the database, you can name them whatever you like.s In this case, all relation fields are lowercased and sometimes pluralized.

<!-- Also note that `@map` and `@@map` are being used: -->

## 7. Install and generate Prisma Client
