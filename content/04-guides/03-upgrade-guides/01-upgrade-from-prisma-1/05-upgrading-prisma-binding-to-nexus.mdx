## Overview

This upgrade guide describes how to migrate a Node.js project that's based on [Prisma 1](https://github.com/prisma/prisma1) and uses `prisma-binding` to implement a GraphQL server. 

The code will be migrated to [Nexus](https://www.nexusjs.org) and the [`nexus-schema-plugin-prisma`](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus-schema-plugin-prisma). As opposed to the _SDL-first_ approach that's used with `prisma-binding`, Nexus follows a code-first approach to construct GraphQL schemas. You can learn about the main differences of these two approaches in this [article](https://www.prisma.io/blog/the-problems-of-schema-first-graphql-development-x1mn4cb0tyl3/).

[Nexus currently only works with TypeScript](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/85), therefore this guide also explains how to migrate from JavaScript to TypeScript. The guide therefore basically assumes a **full rewrite** of your existing app. If you're currently using JavaScript and want to continue doing so, you can follow the [guide](./upgrading-prisma-binding-to-sdl-first) to upgrade from `prisma-binding` to an SDL-first setup. 

The guide assumes that you already went through the [guide for upgrading the Prisma layer](./upgrading-the-prisma-layer). This means you already:

- installed the Prisma 2.0 CLI
- created your Prisma 2.0 schema
- introspected your database and resolved potential schema incompatibilities
- installed and generated Prisma Client

The guide further assumes that you have a file setup that looks similar to this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── prisma
│   └── schema.prisma
├── prisma1
│   ├── datamodel.prisma
│   └── prisma.yml
└── src
    ├── generated
    │   └── prisma.graphql
    ├── index.js
    └── schema.graphql
```

The important parts are:

- A folder called with `prisma` with your Prisma 2.0 schema
- A folder called `src` with your application code and a schema called `schema.graphql`

If this is not what your project structure looks like, you'll need to adjust the instructions in the guide to match your own setup.

## 1. Installing and configuring Nexus 

### 1.1. Install Nexus dependencies

The first step is to install the Nexus dependency in your project:

```
npm install nexus@next
```

> **Note**: Nexus is currently in a [transition phase](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/schema/issues/373) from a standalone [schema construction library](http://nexus.js.org/) to a fully-fledged GraphQL application framework. This guide targets the framework version of Nexus which is currently available under the `@next` npm tag.

Next, install the the Prisma plugin for Nexus which will allow you to expose Prisma models in your GraphQL API:

```
npm install nexus-plugin-prisma
```

The `nexus-plugin-prisma` dependency bundles all required Prisma dependencies. You should therefore remove the dependencies that you added installed when you upgraded the Prisma layer of your app:

```
npm uninstall @prisma/cli @prisma/client
```

Note however that you can still invoke the Prisma 2.0 CLI with the familiar command:

```
npx prisma
```

### 1.2. Configure TypeScript

Since you'll be using TypeScript in this guide, you need to add the required dependencies:

```
npm install typescript ts-node --save-dev
```

Create a new file called `tsconfig.json` in the root directory of your project:

```
touch tsconfig.json
```

Now add the following contents to the new file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "rootDir": "src",
    "plugins": [{ "name": "nexus/typescript-language-service" }]
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

### 1.3. Create your basic Nexus setup

Create the root source file of your API called `app.ts` inside the `src` directory:

```
touch src/app.ts
```

Now add the following setup code to it:

```ts
import { log, settings, use } from 'nexus'
import { prisma } from 'nexus-plugin-prisma'

use(prisma({ migrations: false }))

settings.change({
  server: {
    startMessage: (info) => {
      settings.original.server.startMessage(info)
    },
  },
  schema: {
    generateGraphQLSDLFile: './src/generated/nexus.graphql'
  }
})
```

There are two main things to note about this setup:

- When adding the `nexus-plugin-prisma` via Nexus' `use()` function, you're disabling [Prisma Migrate](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate) which is currently still in an experimental state and therefore is not recommended for production use.
- You'll be generating the SDL-version of your GraphQL schema `nexus.graphql` inside `./src/generated`.

Also, adjust the scripts section inside your `package.json` to include the following commands:

```json line-number
{
  "scripts": {
+    "dev": "nexus dev",
+    "build": "nexus build",
+    "start": "node node_modules/.build"
  }
}
```

The `dev` script starts a development server that you **always** should have running in the background when developing your app.

You can start the development server using the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

You should see the following CLI output:

```
544 ▲ nexus:schema Your GraphQL schema is empty. This is normal if you have not defined any GraphQL types yet. But if you did, check that the file name follows the convention: all graphql.ts modules or direct child modules within a graphql directory are automatically imported.
  3 ● server listening  --  url: 'http://localhost:4000/'
```

Your GraphQL server is now running, but there's no actual _GraphQL schema_ connected to it yet. In the following steps, we'll explain how you can migrate your existing SDL-first GraphQL schema that's implemented with `prisma-binding` to an equivalent setup using Nexus.

## 2. Create your GraphQL types

The next step of the upgrade process is to create your _GraphQL types_. In this case, your GraphQL types will mirror the Prisma models (as it likely was the case in your `prisma-binding` setup as well). If a GraphQL type deviates from a Prisma model, you'll be able to easily adjust the exposed GraphQL type accordingly using the Nexus API. 

For the purpose of this guide, you'll keep all the code in a single file. However, you can structure the files to your personal preference and `import` accordingly.

Create a new file called `graphql.ts` right next to `app.ts`:

```
touch graphql.ts
```

In Nexus, GraphQL types are defined via the `objectType` function that's exposed by the main `schema` object. Import `schema` and then start with the skeleton for your first GraphQL type. In this case, we're starting by mapping Prisma's `User` model to GraphQL:

```ts
import { schema } from 'nexus'

schema.objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    // the fields of the type will be defined here
  },
})
```

With this code in place, you can start exposing the _fields_ of the `User` model one by one. You can use your editor's autocompletion to save some typing. Inside the body of the `definition` function, type `t.model.` and then hit <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SPACE</kbd>. This will bring up the autocompletion and suggest all fields that are defined on the `User` model:

![](https://imgur.com/IlIM2dv.png)

Note that the `model` property on `t` is provided by the `nexus-plugin-prisma`. It leverages the type information from your Prisma schema and allows you to easily expose them via GraphQL.

In that manner, you can start completing your object type definition until you exposed all the fields of the model:

```ts
schema.objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.email()
    t.model.name()
    t.model.jsonData()
    t.model.role()
    t.model.profile()
    t.model.posts()
  },
})
```

At this point, any _relation fields_ might give you TypeScript errors (in this case, that would be `profile` and `posts` which both point to other object types). That's expected, these errors will resolve automatically after you've added the remaining types.

> **Note**: Be sure to have your Nexus development server that you started with `npm run dev` running all the time. It constantly updates the generated Nexus types that enable the autocompletion in the background as you save a file.

Note that the `t.model.posts` relation exposes a _list_ of `Post` objects. By default, Nexus exposes only _pagination_ properties for that list – if you want to add _ordering_ and _filtering_ for that relation as well, you'll need to explicitly enable those:

```ts line-number
schema.objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.email()
    t.model.name()
    t.model.jsonData()
    t.model.role()
    t.model.profile()
+    t.model.posts({
+      filtering: true,
+      ordering: true,
+    })
  },
})
```

> **Note**: If you have one or more fields of type `Json` on any of your Prisma models, enabling `filtering` currently produces an [error](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus-schema-plugin-prisma/issues/666). As a workaround, you can temporarily comment out these field(s) in your Prisma schema.

Once you're done with the first type, you can start defining the remaining ones.

<details><summary>Expand to view the full version of the sample data model</summary>

To expose all sample Prisma models with Nexus, the following code is needed:

```ts
schema.objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.email()
    t.model.name()
    t.model.jsonData()
    t.model.role()
    t.model.profile()
    t.model.posts({
      filtering: true,
      ordering: true,
    })
  },
})

schema.objectType({
  name: 'Post',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.createdAt()
    t.model.updatedAt()
    t.model.title()
    t.model.content()
    t.model.published()
    t.model.author()
    t.model.authorId()
    t.model.categories({
      filtering: true,
      ordering: true,
    })
  },
})

schema.objectType({
  name: 'Profile',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.bio()
    t.model.user()
    t.model.userId()
  },
})

schema.objectType({
  name: 'Category',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.name()
    t.model.posts({
      filtering: true,
      ordering: true,
    })
  },
})
```

</details>

You can view the current version of your GraphQL schema in SDL in the generated GraphQL schema file in `./src/generated/nexus.graphql`.

## 3. Migrate GraphQL operations

As a next step, you can start migrating all the GraphQL _queries_ and _mutations_ from the "previous" GraphQL API to the new one that's built with Nexus.

For this guide, the following sample GraphQL schema will be used:

```graphql
# import Post from './generated/prisma.graphql'
# import User from './generated/prisma.graphql'
# import Category from './generated/prisma.graphql'

input UserUniqueInput {
  id: String
  email: String
}

type Query {
  posts(searchString: String): [Post!]!
  user(userUniqueInput: UserUniqueInput!): User
  users(where: UserWhereInput, orderBy: UserOrderByInput, skip: Int, after: String, before: String, first: Int, last: Int): [User]!
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(data: UserCreateInput!): User!
  createDraft(title: String!, content: String, authorId: ID!): Post
  updateBio(userUniqueInput: UserUniqueInput!, bio: String!): User
  addPostToCategories(postId: String!, categoryIds: [String!]!): Post
}
```

### 3.1. Migrate GraphQL queries

In this section, you'll migrate all GraphQL _queries_ from `prisma-binding` to Nexus.

#### 3.1.1. Define the `Query` type

The first step to migrate any queries is to define the `Query` type of your GraphQL API. Once that's done, you can gradually add operations to it. Add the following definition to `graphql.ts`:

```ts
schema.queryType({
  definition(t) {
    // your GraphQL queries + resolvers will be defined here
  }
})
```

Note that the Nexus API can seem a bit confusing at first. The code above is actually equivalent to writing the following:

```ts
schema.queryType({
  definition: t => {
    // your GraphQL queries + resolvers will be defined here
  }
})
```

However, the first version of the two is the common conventions for Nexus, so it'll be used throughout this guide.

#### 3.1.2. Migrate the `users` query (which uses `forwardTo`)

In our sample API, the `users` query from the sample GraphQL schema is defined and implemented as follows.

##### SDL schema definition with `prisma-binding`

```graphql
type Query {
  users(where: UserWhereInput, orderBy: UserOrderByInput, skip: Int, after: String, before: String, first: Int, last: Int): [User]!
  # ... other queries
}
```

##### Resolver implementation with `prisma-binding`

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users: forwardTo('prisma'),
    // ... other resolvers
  }
}
```

To mirror the same behaviour with Nexus, you can use the `crud` property on the `t` variable inside the `definition` function. 

Similar to `model`, this property is available because you're using the `nexus-prisma-plugin` which leverages type information from your Prisma models and auto-generates resolvers under the hood. The `crud` property also supports autocompletion, so you can explore all available queries in your editor again:

![](https://imgur.com/XoboQUP.png)

##### Forwarding the query with the `nexus-prisma-plugin`

To add the `users` query to your GraphQL API, add the following lines to the query type definition:

```ts line-number
schema.queryType({
  definition(t) {
+    t.crud.users({
+      filtering: true,
+      ordering: true,
+    })
  }
})
```

If you have the Nexus development server running, you can save the file and your GraphQL API will be updated to expose the new `users` query. You can also observe this by looking at the `Query` type inside the generated `nexus.graphql` file:

```graphql
type Query {
  users(after: UserWhereUniqueInput, before: UserWhereUniqueInput, first: Int, last: Int, orderBy: UserOrderByInput, skip: Int, where: UserWhereInput): [User!]!
}
```

You can now write your first query against the new API, e.g.:

```graphql
{
 	users {
    id
    name
    profile {
      id
      bio
    }
    posts {
      id
      title
      categories {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  } 
}
```

If your application exposes all CRUD operations from Prisma using `forwardTo`, you can now continue adding all remaining ones using the same approach via `t.crud`. To learn how "custom" queries can be defined and resolved using Nexus, move on to the next sections.

#### 3.1.3. Migrate the `posts(searchString: String): [Post!]!` query

The `posts` query is defined and implemented as follows.

##### SDL schema definition with `prisma-binding`

```graphql
type Query {
  posts(searchString: String): [Post!]!
  # ... other queries
}
```

##### Resolver implementation with `prisma-binding`

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    posts: (_, args, context, info) => {
      return context.prisma.query.posts(
        {
          where: {
            OR: [
              { title_contains: args.searchString },
              { content_contains: args.searchString },
            ],
          },
        },
        info,
      )
    },
    // ... other resolvers
  }
}
```

##### Code-first schema definition with `nexus`

To get the same behaviour with Nexus, you'll need to add a `t.field` definition to the `queryType`:

```ts line-number
schema.queryType({
  definition(t) {
    // ... previous queries

+    t.list.field('posts', {
+      type: 'Post',
+      nullable: false,
+      args: { searchString: schema.stringArg() }
+    })
  }
})
```

If you look at the generated SDL version of your GraphQL schema inside `nexus.graphql`, you'll notice that this has added the correct _definition_ to your GraphQL schema already:

```graphql line-number
type Query {
|  posts(searchString: String): [Post!]!
  users(after: UserWhereUniqueInput, before: UserWhereUniqueInput, first: Int, last: Int, orderBy: UserOrderByInput, skip: Int, where: UserWhereInput): [User!]!
}
```

You can even send the respective query via the GraphQL Playground already:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

However, the response of such a query will always be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "posts": null
  }
}
```

##### Resolver implementation with `nexus`

That's because you're still missing the _resolver_ implementation for that query. You can add the resolver with Nexus as follows:

```ts line-number
schema.queryType({
  definition(t) {
    // ... previous queries

    t.list.field('posts', {
      type: 'Post',
      nullable: false,
      args: { searchString: schema.stringArg() },
+      resolve: (_, args, context) => {
+        return context.db.post.findMany({
+          where: {
+            OR: [{
+              title: { contains: args.searchString }
+            }, {
+              content: { contains: args.searchString }
+            }]
+          }
+        })
+      }
    })
  }
})
```

If you're re-sending the same query from before, you'll find that it now returns actual data instead of `null`.

Note that the `db` object that's attached to the `context` argument represents your [`PrismaClient`](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/api) instance that you can use to send queries to your database.

#### 3.1.3. Migrate the `user(uniqueInput: UserUniqueInput): User` query

In our sample app, the `user` query is defined and implemented as follows.

##### SDL schema definition with `prisma-binding`

```graphql
type Query {
  user(userUniqueInput: UserUniqueInput): User
  # ... other queries
}

input UserUniqueInput {
  id: String
  email: String
}
```

Note that this is a bit of a contrived example to demonstrate usage of `input` types with Nexus.

##### Resolver implementation with `prisma-binding`

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: (_, args, context, info) => {
      return context.prisma.query.user(
        {
          where: args.userUniqueInput,
        },
        info,
      )
    },
    // ... other resolvers
  }
}
```

##### Code-first schema definition with `nexus`

To get the same behaviour with Nexus, you'll need to add a `t.field` definition to the `queryType` and define an `inputObjectType` that includes the two `@unique` fields of your `User` model:

```ts line-number
+schema.inputObjectType({
+  name: 'UserUniqueInput',
+  definition(t) {
+    t.string('id')
+    t.string('email')
+  },
+})

schema.queryType({
  definition(t) {
    // ... previous queries

+    t.field('user', {
+      type: 'User',
+      args: {
+        userUniqueInput: schema.arg({ 
+          type: 'UserUniqueInput',
+          nullable: false,
+       })
+      }
+    })
  }
})
```

If you look at the generated SDL version of your GraphQL schema inside `nexus.graphql`, you'll notice that this change already added the correct _definition_ to your GraphQL schema:

```graphql line-number
type Query {
  posts(searchString: String): [Post!]
|  user(userUniqueInput: UserUniqueInput!): User
  users(after: UserWhereUniqueInput, before: UserWhereUniqueInput, first: Int, last: Int, orderBy: UserOrderByInput, skip: Int, where: UserWhereInput): [User!]!
}

| input UserUniqueInput {
|   email: String
|   id: String
| }
```

You can even send the respective query via the GraphQL Playground already:

```graphql
{
  user(userUniqueInput: { email: "alice@prisma.io" }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

However, the response of such a query will always be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": null
  }
}
```

##### Code-first resolver implementation with `nexus`

That's because you're still missing the _resolver_ implementation for that query. You can add the resolver with Nexus as follows:

```ts line-number
schema.inputObjectType({
  name: 'UserUniqueInput',
  definition(t) {
    t.string('id')
    t.string('email')
  },
})

schema.queryType({
  definition(t) {
    // ... previous queries

    t.field('user', {
      type: 'User',
      nullable: true,
      args: {
        userUniqueInput: schema.arg({ 
          type: 'UserUniqueInput',
          nullable: false, 
        })
      },
+      resolve: (_, args, context) => {
+        return context.db.user.findOne({
+          where: {
+            id: args.userUniqueInput?.id,
+            email: args.userUniqueInput?.email
+          }
+        })
+      }
    })
  },
  }
})
```

If you're re-sending the same query from before, you'll find that it now returns actual data instead of `null`.

### 3.2. Migrate GraphQL mutations

In this section, you'll migrate the GraphQL mutations from the sample schema to the Nexus.

#### 3.2.1. Define the `Mutation` type

The first step to migrate any mutations is to define the `Mutation` type of your GraphQL API. Once that's done, you can gradually add operations to it. Add the following definition to `graphql.ts`:

```ts
schema.mutationType({
  definition(t) {
    // your GraphQL mutations + resolvers will be defined here
  }
})
```

#### 3.2.2. Migrate the `createUser` mutation (which uses `forwardTo`)

In the sample app, the `createUser` mutation from the sample GraphQL schema is defined and implemented as follows.

##### SDL schema definition with `prisma-binding`

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createUser(data: UserCreateInput!): User!
  # ... other mutations
}
```

##### Resolver implementation with `prisma-binding`

```js
const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    createUser: forwardTo('prisma'),
    // ... other resolvers
  }
}
```

Similar to forwarding GraphQL queries, you can use the `crud` property on the `t` variable inside the `definition` function in order to expose full CRUD capabilities for Prisma models. 

Similar to `model`, this property is available because you're using the `nexus-prisma-plugin` which leverages type information from your Prisma models and auto-generates resolvers under the hood. The `crud` property supports autocompletion when defining mutations as well, so you can explore all available operations in your editor again:

![](https://imgur.com/U0mDPsA.png)

##### Forwarding the mutation with the `nexus-prisma-plugin`

To add the `createUser` mutation to your GraphQL API, add the following lines to the query type definition:

```ts line-number
schema.mutationType({
  definition(t) {
+    t.crud.createOneUser({
+      alias: 'createUser',
+    })
  }
})
```

Note that the default name for the mutation in your GraphQL schema is `createdOneUser` (named after the function which is exposed by `t.crud`). In order to rename it to `createUser`, you need to provide the `alias` property.

If you have the Nexus development server running, you can save the file and your GraphQL API will be updated to expose the new `createUser` mutation. You can also observe this by looking at the `Mutation` type inside the generated `nexus.graphql` file:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createUser(data: UserCreateInput!): User!
}
```

You can now write your first mutation against the new API, e.g.:

```graphql
mutation {
 	createUser(data: {
     name: "Alice",
     email: "alice@prisma.io"
   }) {
     id
   }
}
```

If your application exposes all CRUD operations from Prisma using `forwardTo`, you can now continue adding all remaining ones using the same approach via `t.crud`. To learn how "custom" mutations can be defined and resolved using Nexus, move on to the next sections.

#### 3.2.3. Migrate the `createDraft(title: String!, content: String, authorId: String!): Post!` query

In the sample app, the `createDraft` mutation is defined and implemented as follows.

##### SDL schema definition with `prisma-binding`

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createDraft(title: String!, content: String, authorId: String!): Post!
  # ... other mutations
}
```

##### Resolver implementation with `prisma-binding`

```js
const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    createDraft: (_, args, context, info) => {
      return context.prisma.mutation.createPost(
        {
          data: {
            title: args.title,
            content: args.content,
            author: {
              connect: {
                id: args.authorId,
              },
            },
          },
        },
        info,
      )
    },
    // ... other resolvers
  }
}
```

##### Code-first schema definition with `nexus`

To get the same behaviour with Nexus, you'll need to add a `t.field` definition to the `mutationType`:

```ts line-number
schema.mutationType({
  definition(t) {
    // ... previous mutations

+    t.field('createDraft', {
+      type: 'Post',
+      args: { 
+        title: schema.stringArg({ nullable: false }),
+        content: schema.stringArg(),
+        authorId: schema.stringArg({ nullable: false }),
+      }
+    })
  }
})
```

If you look at the generated SDL version of your GraphQL schema inside `nexus.graphql`, you'll notice that this has added the correct _definition_ to your GraphQL schema already:

```graphql line-number
type Mutation {
  createUser(data: UserCreateInput!): User!
|  createDraft(title: String!, content: String, authorId: String!): Post!
}
```

You can even send the respective mutation via the GraphQL Playground already:

```graphql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "Hello World",
    authorId: "__AUTHOR_ID__"
  ) {
    id
    published
    auhor {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

However, the response of such a mutation will always be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createDraft": null
  }
}
```

##### Resolver implementation with `nexus`

That's because you're still missing the _resolver_ implementation for that mutation. You can add the resolver with Nexus as follows:

```ts line-number
schema.mutationType({
  definition(t) {
    // ... previous mutations

    t.field('createDraft', {
      type: 'Post',
      args: { 
        title: schema.stringArg({ nullable: false }),
        content: schema.stringArg(),
        authorId: schema.stringArg({ nullable: false }),
      },
+      resolve: (_, args) => {
+        return context.db.post.create({
+          data: {
+            title: args.title,
+            content: args.content,
+            author: {
+              connect: { id: args.authorId }
+            }
+          }
+        })
+      }
    })
  }
})
```

If you're re-sending the same query from before, you'll find that it now returns actual data instead of `null`.

#### 3.2.4. Migrate the `updateBio(bio: String, userUniqueInput: UserUniqueInput!): User` mutation

In the sample app, the `updateBio` mutation is defined and implemented as follows.

##### SDL schema definition with `prisma-binding`

```graphql
type Mutation {
  updateBio(bio: String!, userUniqueInput: UserUniqueInput!): User
  # ... other mutations
}
```

##### Resolver implementation with `prisma-binding`

```js
const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    updateBio: (_, args, context, info) => {
      return context.prisma.mutation.updateUser(
        {
          data: {
            profile: {
              update: { bio: args.bio }
            }
          },
          where: { id: args.userId }
        },
        info,
      )
    },
    // ... other resolvers
  }
}
```

##### Code-first schema definition with `nexus`

To get the same behaviour with Nexus, you'll need to add a `t.field` definition to the `mutationType`:

```ts line-number
schema.mutationType({
  definition(t) {
    // ... previous mutations

+    t.field('updateBio', {
+      type: 'User',
+      args: {
+        userUniqueInput: schema.arg({ 
+          type: 'UserUniqueInput', 
+          nullable: false 
+        }),
+        bio: schema.stringArg({ nullable: false })
+      },
+    })
  }
})
```

If you look at the generated SDL version of your GraphQL schema inside `nexus.graphql`, you'll notice that this has added the correct _definition_ to your GraphQL schema already:

```graphql line-number
type Mutation {
  createUser(data: UserCreateInput!): User!
  createDraft(title: String!, content: String, authorId: String!): Post!
|  updateBio(bio: String!, userUniqueInput: UserUniqueInput!): User
}
```

You can even send the respective mutation via the GraphQL Playground already:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateBio(
    userUniqueInput: {
      email: "alice@prisma.io"
    }
    bio: "I like turtles"
  ){
    id
    name
    profile {
      id
      bio
    }
  }
}
```

However, the response of such a mutation will always be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "updateBio": null
  }
}
```

##### Resolver implementation with `nexus`

That's because you're still missing the _resolver_ implementation for that query. You can add the resolver with Nexus as follows:

    t.field('updateBio', {
      type: 'User',
      args: {
        userUniqueInput: schema.arg({ 
          type: 'UserUniqueInput', 
          nullable: false 
        }),
        bio: schema.stringArg()
      },
+      resolve: (_, args, context) => {
+        return context.db.user.update({
+          where: {
+            id: args.userUniqueInput?.id,
+            email: args.userUniqueInput?.email
+          },
+          data: {
+            profile: {
+              create: { bio: args.bio }
+            }
+          }
+        })
+      }
+    })
  }
})
```

If you're re-sending the same query from before, you'll find that it now returns actual data instead of `null`.


#### 3.2.5. Migrate the `addPostToCategories(postId: String!, categoryIds: [String!]!): Post` mutation

In our sample app, the `addPostToCategories` mutation is defined and implemented as follows.

##### SDL schema definition with `prisma-binding`

```graphql
type Mutation {
  addPostToCategories(postId: String!, categoryIds: [String!]!): Post
  # ... other mutations
}
```

##### Resolver implementation with `prisma-binding`

```js
const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    addPostToCategories: (_, args, context, info) => {
      const ids = args.categoryIds.map(id => ({ id }))
      return context.prisma.mutation.updatePost(
        {
          data: {
            categories: {
              connect: ids
            }
          },
          where: {
            id: args.postId
          }
        },
        info,
      )
    },
    // ... other resolvers
  }
}
```

+        postId: schema.stringArg({ nullable: false }),
+        categoryIds: schema.stringArg({ 
+          list: true, 
+          nullable: false 
+        }),

|  addPostToCategories(postId: String!, categoryIds: [String!]!): Post
}
```

You can even send the respective query via the GraphQL Playground already:

})
```

## 4. Cleaning up 

Since the entire app has now been upgrade to Prisma 2.0 and Nexus, you can delete all unnecessary files and remove the no longer needed dependencies.

### 4.1. Clean up npm dependencies

You can start by removing npm dependencies that were related to the Prisma 1 setup:

```
npm uninstall graphql-cli graphql-yoga prisma-binding prisma1
```

### 4.2. Delete unused files

Next, delete the files of your Prisma 1 setup:

```
rm prisma1/datamodel.prisma prisma1/prisma.yml
```

You can also delete any remaining `.js` files, the `schema.graphql` and `prisma.graphql` files.

### 4.3. Stop the Prisma server

Finally, you can stop running your Prisma server.
