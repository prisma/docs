## Overview

In this guide, you will set up and deploy a serverless Node.js REST API to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) using the Serverless Framework.

AWS Lambda is part of the AWS cloud platform and allows you to use the serverless paradigm to run your code without managing servers. To deploy a REST API to AWS Lambda, you need to make use of several additional AWS services, namely [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to host the files and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) to expose the API over HTTP.

The Serverless Framework simplifies the deployment to Lambda with a CLI that helps with workflow automation and AWS resource provisioning.

The REST API will use Prisma Client to handle fetching, creating, and deleting records from a database. Specifically, each function will represent a REST resource endpoint and use Prisma Client to handle database operations against a PostgreSQL database (e.g. hosted on Heroku).

The focus of this guide is showing how an API based on Prisma can be deployed to AWS Lambda. The starting point will the [Prisma AWS example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/master/deployment-platforms/aws-lambda) which has a couple of REST endpoints preconfigured as serverless functions.

> Throughout the guide you'll find various **checkpoints** that enable you to validate whether you performed the steps correctly.

## A note on deploying GraphQL servers to AWS Lambda

While the example uses REST, the same principles apply to a GraphQL server, with the main difference being that you typically only need a single function to serve a GraphQL API.

In that function, the `context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop` of the [AWS Lambda Context Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-context.html) needs to be set to `false` as follows:

```js
exports.server = (event, context, cb) => {
  // Set to false to send the response right away when the callback executes, instead of waiting for the Node.js event loop to be empty.
  context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop = false

  return lambda.graphqlHandler(event, context, cb)
}
```

## Prerequisites

- Hosted PostgreSQL database and a URL from which it can be accessed, e.g. `postgresql://username:password@your_postgres_db.cloud.com/db_identifier` (you can use Heroku, which offers a [free plan](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1)).
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account and a corresponding [access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey) for programmatic access.
- [Serverless Framework CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) installed.
- Node.js installed.
- PostgreSQL CLI `psql` installed.

## Prisma workflow

Prisma supports different workflows depending on whether you integrate with an existing database or create a new one from scratch. Regardless of the workflow, Prisma relies on the Prisma schema, i.e. `schema.prisma` file.

This guide starts with an empty database created with plain SQL and looks as follows:

1. Define the database schema using SQL.
1. Run `prisma introspect` locally which will introspect and populate the `schema.prisma` with models based on the database schema.
1. Run `prisma generate` which will generate Prisma Client based on the Prisma schema.

## 1. Download the example

Open your terminal and navigate to a location of your choice. Create the directory that will hold the application code and download the example code:

```sh
mkdir prisma-aws-lambda
cd prisma-aws-lambda
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=3 prisma-examples-master/deployment-platforms/aws-lambda/
```

<!-- tar strip folder is a concatenation of the REPOSITORY-BRANCH/REF, e.g. prisma-examples-master -->

**Checkpoint:** `ls -1` should show:

```sh
ls -1
README.md
aws-credentials
handlers
node_modules
package-lock.json
package.json
prisma
schema.sql
serverless.yml
```

After downloading the example code, install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## 2. Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable locally

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable locally so you can create the database schema and Prisma can access the database to introspect:

```sh
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__"
```

> **Note:** you will need the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for the subsequent steps. Set it in all terminal sessions related to this project.

You need to replace the uppercase placeholders with your database credentials, e.g.:

```sh
postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@yourpostgres.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/yourdbname
```

## 3. Set the DATABASE_URL in `.env`

For the Lambda functions to access the database, they need access to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

For this, you need to define a `.env` file which the preconfigured `serverless-dotenv-plugin` will use to inject into the function runtime.

The repository contains a `.env.example` example file to assist with this.

Copy the file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open the .env file and set the `DATABASE_URL` with the same value as in step 2.

> **Note:** When working with Git repositories, it's best practice to keep secrets, e.g. DATABASE_URL out of the repository. This is typically done by adding a line to `.gitignore` to ignore the `.env` file. This guide only copies the source without creating a repository, so this is not necessary unless you initialize a repository.

## 4. Create the database schema

To create your database schema, run the `schema.sql` from the example code as follows:

```sh
psql $DATABASE_URL -f schema.sql
```

**Checkpoint:** `psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt"` should show the list of tables:

```text
      List of relations
Schema |  Name   | Type  |     Owner
--------+---------+-------+----------------
public | Post    | table | janedoe
public | Profile | table | janedoe
public | User    | table | janedoe
```

Congratulations, you have successfully created the database schema.

## 5. Introspect the database

Introspect the database with the Prisma CLI:

```sh
npx prisma introspect
```

Prisma will introspect the database defined in the `datasource` block of the Prisma schema and populate the Prisma schema with models corresponding to the database tables.

**Checkpoint:** `prisma/schema.prisma` should look as follows (note that the fields on the models have been reordered for better readability):

```prisma
model Post {
  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  User      User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id]) // relation field
  authorId  Int // relation scalar field
}

model Profile {
  id     Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  bio    String?
  userId Int     @unique // relation scalar field
  User   User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id]) // relation field
}

model User {
  id      Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  Post    Post[] // relation field
  Profile Profile? // relation field
}
```

### Rename the relation fields for easy access

Because both the generated `Post` and `Profile` fields in the `User` model are _virtual_ (i.e. they're _not backed by a foreign key in the database_), you can manually rename them in your Prisma schema. This will only affect the generated client and is typically done so that they have a more meaningful name in the context of the relation.

In the resulting Prisma schema there are two types of relation fields:

- Relation fields: identified by having a Model name as the type, e.g. the `User` field in the `Post` model. Can be renamed to better fit its usage, e.g. `User` -> `author`.
- [Relation scalar fields](../..//reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations): these are used to store the foreign key, e.g. the `authorId` field in the `Post` model. Cannot be rename as it must match the field in the database.

The names of the relation fields are used in the client to access those relations for example, fetching a specific `Post` and its associated `User` object would as follows with the Prisma schema above:

```js
const postAuthor = await prisma.post.findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: { User: true },
})
```

If you rename the `User` field in the `Post` model to `author`, you'll be able to access it as follows:

```js
const postAuthor = await prisma.post.findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: { author: true },
})
```

Based on that logic, rename the relation fields to better adhere to the [naming conventions](../../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/models#naming-fields):

```prisma
model Post {
  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id]) // renamed from `User` -> `author`
  authorId  Int // relation scalar field
}

model Profile {
  id     Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  bio    String?
  userId Int     @unique  // relation scalar field
  user   User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id]) // renamed from `User` -> `user`
}

model User {
  id      Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  posts   Post[] // renamed from `Post` -> `posts`
  profile Profile? // renamed from `User` -> `profile`
}
```

## 6. Set the AWS Access key as an environment variable

In order for the Serverless Framework to provision the AWS resources and deploy your application, you need to configure the access key.

There are different ways to get the access key, depending on whether you create you use your personal account or create a special IAM user for the Serverless Framework (this approach is recommended for security reasons as it allows to set granular permissions). To get an access key for your account, follow the [AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey)

Once you have the _Access key ID_ and a _Secret access key_. Set them with the following command:

```
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  --secret AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

## 7. Deploy the app

Your project is now ready for deployment:

```
serverless deploy
```

Serverless will create the AWS resources and upload your code, and output the service information:

```
Service Information
service: prisma-aws-lambda-example
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
stack: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev
resources: 39
api keys:
  None
endpoints:
  GET - https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/
  GET - https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/seed
  GET - https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/users
  POST - https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/users
  GET - https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/posts
functions:
  status: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev-status
  seed: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev-seed
  getUsers: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev-getUsers
  createUser: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev-createUser
  getPosts: prisma-aws-lambda-example-dev-getPosts
layers:
  None
```

**Checkpoint:** Call the status endpoint

```sh
curl https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/
```

The call should return: `{"up":true}`

## 8. Test your deployed REST API

With the API base URL: `https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/`, you can test the API's endpoints:

| Endpoint      | Description                                                                                                              | Implementation            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `GET /`       | Status                                                                                                                   | `handlers/status.js`      |
| `GET /seed`   | Delete all database records and seed the database with test `users`, `profiles`, and `posts`. Returns the created users. | `handlers/seed.js`        |
| `GET /users`  | Fetch all `users` in the database with their related `profiles`                                                          | `handlers/users.js`       |
| `POST /users` | Create a single `users` in the database                                                                                  | `handlers/create-user.js` |
| `GET /posts`  | Fetch all `posts` and their related `authors`                                                                            | `handlers/posts.js`       |

To call the API, you can use curl:

```
curl -v https://UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/seed
```

## Notes

### serverless.yaml

The `serverless.yml` configuration file is where the endpoint and function configuration lives.
You can update this file to add or change endpoints. For more AWS specific configuration, check out the AWS provider configuration in the [Serverless Framework Docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/functions/).

### Binary targets in schema.prisma

The Prisma schema contains the following in the generator block:

```
binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-1.0.x"]
```

This is necessary as the local runtime is different to the Lambda runtime. Adding the `binaryTarget` will ensure that the compatible Prisma Engine binary is available.

## Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the API to AWS Lambda.

For more insight into Prisma Client's API, look at the function handlers in the `handlers/` folder.

Generally, when using a FaaS (function as a service) environment to interact with a database, it's beneficial to pool DB connections for performance reasons. This is because every function invocation may result in a new connection to the database (this is not a problem with a constantly running node.js server). For more information on some of the solutions, you may want to look at our [general FaaS guide](/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/deployment#serverless-faas).
