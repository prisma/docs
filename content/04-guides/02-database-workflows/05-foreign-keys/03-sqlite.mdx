## Overview

This page explains how to configure [foreign key constraints](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html) in your SQLite database. Foreign keys are used to represent _relations_ in your database.

In this guide, you'll create two tables where one references the other via a foreign key. Foreign keys can be defined on a **single column** or on **multiple columns**. This guide covers both approaches.

At the end of the guide, you'll introspect your database to reflect the foreign key in the Prisma schema, then you'll generate Prisma Client and write a simple Node.js script to test the foreign key relation.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this guide, you need:

- the [`sqlite3`](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html) command line client for SQLite
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine

## 1. Create a new database and project directory

Start by creating a project directory where you can put the files you'll create throughout this guide:

```
mkdir foreign-key-demo
cd foreign-key-demo
```

Next, execute the following command in your terminal to create a new database called `ForeignKeyDemo`:

```
sqlite3 ForeignKeyDemo.db '.databases'
```

You can validate that the database was created by running the `.tables` command which lists all tables (_relations_) in your database (right now there are none):

```
sqlite3 ForeignKeyDemo.db '.tables'
```

## 2. Create two tables with a single-column foreign key constraint

In this section, you'll **create two tables where one references the other via a single-column foreign key** in the `ForeignKeyDemo` database.

Create a new file called `single-column-foreign-key.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "User" (
  "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  "name" TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE "Post" (
  "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  "title" TEXT,
  "authorId" INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY ("authorId") REFERENCES "User" ("id")
);
```

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create the two tables:

```
sqlite3 ForeignKeyDemo.db < single-column-foreign-key.sql
```

Congratulations, you just created two tables called `User` and `Post` in the database. The `Post` table references the `User` table via the foreign key defined on the `authorId` column.

<details><summary>Alternative: Define the constraint as a <strong>column constraint</strong></summary>
<br />

In the code above, you created the unique constraint as a **table constraint**. Alternatively, you can define it as a **column constraint**. There's no practical difference between the two, the alternative is just added for completeness.

To add the foreign key constraint as a column constraint, you need to adjust your SQL statement for creating the `Post` table to look as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
  "id" SERIAL,
  "title" TEXT,
  "authorId" INTEGER REFERENCES "User"("id")
);
```

</details>

## 3. Create a table with a multi-column foreign key constraint

In this section, you'll **create two tables where one references the other via a single-column foreign key** in the `ForeignKeyDemo` database.

Create a new file called `multi-column-foreign-key.sql` and add the following code to it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "AnotherUser" (
  "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  "firstName" TEXT,
  "lastName" TEXT,
  UNIQUE ("firstName", "lastName")
);

CREATE TABLE "AnotherPost" (
  "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  "title" TEXT,
  "authorFirstName" TEXT,
  "authorLastName" TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY ("authorFirstName", "authorLastName") REFERENCES "AnotherUser"("firstName", "lastName")
);
```

> **Note**: The `UNIQUE` constraint on `AnotherUser` is needed to be able to reference the columns as foreign keys.

Now run the SQL statement against your database to create a new table called `AnotherUser`:

```
sqlite3 ForeignKeyDemo.db < multi-column-foreign-key.sql
```

Congratulations, you just created two tables called `AnotherUser` and `AnotherPost` in the database. The `AnotherPost` table references the `AnotherUser` table via the foreign key defined on the `authorFirstName` and `authorLastName` columns.

## 4. Introspect your database with Prisma

In the previous sections, you created two times two tables with foreign key constraints:

- The table `Post` has a singe-column foreign key on it's `authorId` column which points to the `id` field of the `User` table.
- The table `AnotherPost` has a multi-column foreign key on it's `authorFirstName` and `authorLastName` columns which point to the `firstName` and `lastField` columns of the `AnotherUser` table.

In this section you'll introspect your database to generate the Prisma models for these tables.

To start, set up a new Node.js project and add the `prisma` CLI as a development dependency:

```
npm init -y
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

In order to introspect your database, you need to tell Prisma how to connect to it. You do so by configuring a `datasource` in your Prisma schema.

Create a new file called `schema.prisma` and add the following code to it:

```prisma
datasource sqlite {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The database connection URL is set via an environment variable. The Prisma CLI automatically supports the [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) format which automatically picks up environment variables defined in a file called `.env`.

Create a new file called `.env` and set your database connection URL as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:../ForeignKeyDemo.db
```

With both the `schema.prisma` and `.env` files in place, you can run Prisma's introspection with the following command:

```
npx prisma introspect
```

This command introspects your database and for each table adds a Prisma model to the Prisma schema:

```prisma
datasource sqlite {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id   Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name String?
  Post Post[]
}

model Post {
  authorId Int?
  id       Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title    String?
  User     User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}

model AnotherUser {
  firstName   String?
  id          Int           @default(autoincrement()) @id
  lastName    String?
  AnotherPost AnotherPost[]

  @@unique([firstName, lastName], name: "sqlite_autoindex_AnotherUser_1")
}

model AnotherPost {
  authorFirstName String?
  authorLastName  String?
  id              Int          @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title           String?
  AnotherUser     AnotherUser? @relation(fields: [authorFirstName, authorLastName], references: [firstName, lastName])
}
```

## 5. Generate Prisma Client

To validate whether the foreign key constraints work, you'll now generate Prisma Client and send a few sample queries to the database to test the relations.

First, add a `generator` block to your Prisma schema (typically added right below the `datasource` block):

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

Run the following command to install and generate Prisma Client in your project:

```
npx prisma generate
```

Now you can use Prisma Client to send database queries in Node.js.

## 6. Validate the foreign key constraints in a Node.js script

Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code to it:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const userWithPost = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Alice',
      Post: {
        create: {
          title: 'Hello World from Alice',
        },
      },
    },
    include: {
      Post: true,
    },
  });
  console.log(userWithPost);

  const anotherUserWithPost = await prisma.anotherUser.create({
    data: {
      firstName: 'Bob',
      lastName: 'Smith',
      AnotherPost: {
        create: {
          title: 'Hello World from Bob',
        },
      },
    },
    include: {
      AnotherPost: true,
    },
  });
  console.log(anotherUserWithPost);
}

main();
```

In this code, you're creating two `User` records, each with a related `Post` record.

Run the code with this command:

```
node index.js
```

The following output indicates that the foreign key constraint is working as intended:


```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Alice',
  Post: [ { authorId: 1, id: 1, title: 'Hello World from Alice' } ]
}
{
  firstName: 'Bob',
  id: 1,
  lastName: 'Smith',
  AnotherPost: [
    {
      authorFirstName: 'Bob',
      authorLastName: 'Smith',
      id: 1,
      title: 'Hello World from Bob'
    }
  ]
}
```
