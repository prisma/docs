## Overview

This page describes how you can configure your editor for an optimal developer experience when using Prisma.

If you don't see your editor here, please [open a feature request](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) and ask for dedicated support for your editor (e.g. for syntax highlighting and auto-formatting).

## VS Code

You can install the [Prisma VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma).
