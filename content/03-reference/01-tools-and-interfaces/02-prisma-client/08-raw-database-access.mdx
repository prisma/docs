## Overview

To send raw SQL queries to your database, you can use two functions that are exposed by your `PrismaClient` instance:
`queryRaw` and `executeRaw`.

## `queryRaw`

You can use `queryRaw`, if you are interested in retrieving actual database records, for example with `SELECT`:


```ts
const result = await prisma.queryRaw('SELECT * FROM User;')
```

`result` is an array where each object corresponds to a retrieved database record:

```js
[
  { id: 1, email: 'sarah@prisma.io', name: 'Sarah' },
  { id: 2, email: 'alice@prisma.io', name: 'Alice' },
]
```

## `executeRaw`

Sometimes you are interested in the *number of affected rows of a database operation* instead of retrieving records.
This can be the case for example if you want to perform an `UPDATE` query, that potentially updates multiple records in the database:

```ts
const result: number = await prisma.executeRaw('UPDATE User SET active = $1 WHERE emailValidated = $2;', true, true)
```

`result` describes the number of affected rows by the `UPDATE` operation.

## Tagged templates

Both the `queryRaw` and `executeRaw` methods are implemented as a [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates). Therefore, you can also call `queryRaw` as follows:

```ts
const result = await prisma.queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User;`
```

`executeRaw` can be called like so:

```ts
const result: number = await prisma.executeRaw`UPDATE User SET active = ${true} WHERE emailValidated = ${true}`
```

## Setting variables

To include variables in your SQL query, you can use JavaScript string interpolation with [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals):

```ts
const userId = 42
const result = await prisma.raw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ${userId};`
```

## Typing `queryRaw` results

While `executeRaw` always returns `Promise<number>`, the return type of `queryRaw` can be adjusted with a TypeScript Generic.
It has the following function signature:

```ts
queryRaw<T = any>(query: string | TemplateStringsArray): Promise<T>;
```

The return type of `raw` is a `Promise` for the [generic](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) type parameter `T`. This means you can type the result manually by providing `T` when you invoke `raw`. If you don't provide any type, the return type of `raw` defaults to `any`.

```ts
// import the generated `User` type from the `@prisma/client` module
import { User } from '@prisma/client'

const result = await prisma.raw<User[]>('SELECT * FROM User;')
// result is of type: `User[]`
```

Now, `result` is statically typed to the generated `User` type (or rather an array thereof) from Prisma Client.

If you're selecting only specific fields of the model or want to include relations, read the documentation about [leveraging Prisma Client's generated types](advanced-usage-of-generated-types) if you want to ensure that the query results are properly typed.

## When to use what?

You might ask yourself - when do I use `queryRaw` and when `executeRaw`?
The simple rule of thumb is: If you mutate data, you probably want to know the number of affected rows, therefore you use `executeRaw`.
If you on the other hand want to retrieve rows and actually query data, you can use `queryRaw`.
