## Overview

You can send raw SQL queries to your database using the `raw` function that's exposed by your `PrismaClient` instance. It returns the query results as plain old JavaScript objects:

```ts
const result = await prisma.raw('SELECT * FROM User;')
```

`result` is an array where each object corresponds to a retrieved database record:

```js
;[
  { id: 1, email: 'sarah@prisma.io', name: 'Sarah' },
  { id: 2, email: 'alice@prisma.io', name: 'Alice' },
]
```

## Tagged templates

The `raw` method is implemented as a [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates). Therefore, you can also call `raw` as follows:

```ts
const result = await prisma.raw`SELECT * FROM User;`
```

## Setting variables

To include variables in your SQL query, you can use JavaScript string interpolation with [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals):

```ts
const userId = 42
const result = await prisma.raw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ${userId};`
```

## Typing `raw` results

The `raw` function has the following function signature:

```ts
raw<T = any>(query: string | TemplateStringsArray): Promise<T>;
```

The return type of `raw` is a `Promise` for the [generic](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) type parameter `T`. This means you can type the result manually by providing `T` when you invoke `raw`. If you don't provide any type, the return type of `raw` defaults to `any`.

```ts
// import the generated `User` type from the `@prisma/client` module
import { User } from '@prisma/client'

const result = await prisma.raw<User[]>('SELECT * FROM User;')
// result is of type: `User[]`
```

Now, `result` is statically typed to the generated `User` type (or rather an array thereof) from Prisma Client.

If you're selecting only specific fields of the model or want to include relations, read the documentation about [leveraging Prisma Client's generated types](advanced-usage-of-generated-types) if you want to ensure that the query results are properly typed.

Note that calls to `SELECT` always return arrays of type `T`, but other SQL operations (like `INSERT` or `UPDATE`) might return single objects.
