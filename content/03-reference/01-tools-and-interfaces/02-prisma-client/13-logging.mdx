## Overview

You can view the generated database queries that Prisma Client sends to your database as well as warnings and other information by configuring different _log levels_ in the `PrismaClient` constructor. You can do this via the `log` option:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: ['query', 'info', 'warn'],
});
```

This logs all log levels:

- `query`: Logs the SQL queries that are generated by a Prisma Client API call
- `info`: Logs general information
- `warn`: Logs warnings

## The `log` option

### Type

The `log` options is optional and has the following type:

```ts
log?: Array<LogLevel | LogDefinition>
```

If the `log` option is not provided, nothing will be logged.

Here's the type definitions for `LogLevel` and `LogDefinition`:

```ts
type LogLevel = 'info' | 'query' | 'warn';
type LogDefinition = {
  level: LogLevel;
  emit: 'stdout' | 'event';
};
```

By default, logs are printed to [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) so you can directly observe them. Alternatively, you can also configure event-based logging and observe the logs by providing a callback to the `on()` function.

### Logging to stdout

If you want to print your logs to stdout, you can provide the `LogLevel` values directly to the `log` option:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: ['query', 'info', 'warn'],
});
```

Since stdout is the default, the above code snippet is equivalent to the following one where you're explicitly passing `stdout` to the `emit` option:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [
    {
      emit: 'stdout',
      level: 'query',
    },
    {
      emit: 'stdout',
      level: 'info',
    },
    {
      emit: 'stdout',
      level: 'warn',
    },
  ],
});
```

### Event-based logging

If you want to apply some custom logic to your logs, you can also set `emit` to `event`:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [
    {
      emit: 'event',
      level: 'query',
    },
    {
      emit: 'event',
      level: 'info',
    },
    {
      emit: 'event',
      level: 'warn',
    },
  ],
});

// ... must now call prisma.on(...) in order to handle the logging events
```

If you do this, you need to call the `.on` function on your `PrismaClient` instance and provide a callback function which then receives the logging event. Depending on the selected log level, the input event will carry different arguments.

#### Logging `query` events

Here is a sample snippet that shows how to log an incoming event `e` (for the log level `query`):

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [
    {
      emit: 'event',
      level: 'query',
    },
  ],
});

prisma.on('query', e => {
  e.timestamp;
  e.query;
  e.params;
  e.duration;
  e.target;
  console.log(e);
});
```

The incoming event `e` is of type `QueryEvent` which is defined as follows:

```ts
export type QueryEvent = {
  timestamp: Date;
  query: string;
  params: string;
  duration: number;
  target: string;
};
```

Note that `query` contains the SQL query and `params` contains any query parameters for the SQL query.

<details><summary>Expand to see a logging example</summary>

With the above configuration, assume you're sending the following query with Prisma Client:

```ts
const allPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: { published: true },
  include: {
    author: true,
  },
})
```

This API call generates two SQL queries that are being sent as events to the callback configured via `on()`. Here's a sample for what these events might look like:

```js
{
  timestamp: 2020-03-10T08:36:57.430Z,
  query: 'SELECT `dev`.`Post`.`id`, `dev`.`Post`.`title`, ' +
    '`dev`.`Post`.`content`, `dev`.`Post`.`published`, ' +
    '`dev`.`Post`.`author` FROM `dev`.`Post` WHERE ' +
    '`dev`.`Post`.`published` = ? LIMIT ? OFFSET ?',
  params: '[true,-1,0]',
  duration: 0,
  target: 'quaint::connector::metrics'
}
{
  timestamp: 2020-03-10T08:36:57.430Z,
  query: 'SELECT `dev`.`User`.`id`, `dev`.`User`.`email`, `dev`.`User`.`name` ' +
    'FROM `dev`.`User` WHERE `dev`.`User`.`id` IN (?,?) LIMIT ? OFFSET ?',
  params: '[3,2,-1,0]',
  duration: 0,
  target: 'quaint::connector::metrics'
}
```

#### Logging `info` events

Here is a sample snippet that shows how to log an incoming event `e` (for the log level `info`):

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [
    {
      emit: 'event',
      level: 'info',
    },
  ],
});

prisma.on('info', e => {
  e.timestamp;
  e.message;
  e.target;
  console.log(e);
});
```

The incoming event `e` is of type `LogEvent` which is defined as follows:

```ts
export type LogEvent = {
  timestamp: Date;
  message: string;
  target: string;
};
```

#### Logging `warn` events

Here is a sample snippet that shows how to log an incoming event `e` (for the log level `warn`):

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [
    {
      emit: 'event',
      level: 'warn',
    },
  ],
});

prisma.on('warn', e => {
  e.timestamp;
  e.message;
  e.target;
  console.log(e);
});
```

The incoming event `e` is of type `LogEvent` which is defined as follows:

```ts
export type LogEvent = {
  timestamp: Date;
  message: string;
  target: string;
};
```
