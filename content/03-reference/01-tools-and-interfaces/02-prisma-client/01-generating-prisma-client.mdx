This page explains how to generate Prisma Client. Generating Prisma Client requires the Prisma CLI installed on your machine (learn more [here]()).

Prisma Client is an auto-generated database client that's tailored to your database schema. By default, it lives inside your `node_modules` directory in `node_modules/@prisma/client`. This location can be adjusted if needed.

Generating Prisma Client requires three steps:

1. Add the following `generator` definition to your Prisma schema:
   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }
   ```
1. Install the `@prisma/client` npm module:
   ```
   npm install @prisma/client
   ```
1. Generate Prisma Client with the following comand:
   ```
   prisma generate
   ```

**Important**: You need to re-execute the `prisma generate` command after every change that's made to your Prisma schema to update the generated Prisma Client code.

Here is a graphical illustration of the typicaly workflow for the Prisma Client generation:

Note also that `prisma generate` is _automatically_ invoked when you're installing the `@prisma/client` npm module. So, when you're initially setting up Prisma Client, you can typically save the third step from the list above.

Once generated, you can import and instantiate Prisma Client in your code as follows:

```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

or

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

## The `@prisma/client` npm module

### How `@prisma/client` compares to "conventional" node modules

The `@prisma/client` node module is different from "conventional" node modules. With conventional node modules, the entire package is downloaded into your `node_modules` directory and only gets updated when you re-install the package.

As an example for such a module, consider the [`lodash`](https://lodash.com/) npm module. When you install it with `npm install lodash`, it gets downloaded and stored into `node_modules/lodash`. This `node_modules/lodash` directory doesn't change unless another `npm install` is invoked at some point (e.g. when an update of the package is available).

The `@prisma/client` node module is different. It is a "facade package" (basically a stub) that doesn't contain any functional code, such as types or the Prisma Client runtime.

While you do need to install it _once_ with `npm install @prisma/client`, it is likely that the code inside the `node_modules/@prisma/client` directory changes more often as you're evolving your application. This is because the directory contains code that is _generated_ based on your Prisma schema. When your Prisma schema changes (e.g. because you perform a [schema migration]()), you need to re-execute `prisma generate` which takes care of updating the code in `node_modules/@prisma/client` so that it reflects the schema changes.

Because the `node_modules/@prisma/client` directory contains some code that is _specific_ to _your_ project, it is sometimes called a "smart node module".

### Why is the "facade package" needed if Prisma Client is generated?

The "facade package" is necessary to enable typical build and deployment workflows of Node.js applications. Here are a few examples for this:

- This workflow allows teams to follow conventional practices for version control (because developers can clone repositories, run `npm install` and have the repo be ready without an extra step of running `prisma generate`).
- The facade package ensures that Prisma Client survives the [pruning](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/prune.html) that's often employed by Node.js package managers.

## Specifying the target location for Prisma Client

The Prisma Client generator can be specified as follows in your schema file:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

Note that this is equivalent to specifying the default `output` path `./node_modules/@prisma/client`:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./node_modules/@prisma/client"
}
```

After running `prisma generate` for either of these schema files, the Prisma Client package will be located in:

```
node_modules/@prisma/client
```

You can also specify a custom `output` path on the `generator` configuration, for example:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./src/generated/client"
}
```

After running `prisma generate` for that schema file, the Prisma Client package will be located in:

```
./src/generated/client
```

## Why is Prisma Client generated into `node_modules/@prisma/client` by default?

### Importing Prisma Client

By generating Prisma Client into `node_modules/@prisma/client`, you can import it and instantiate it in your code as follows:

```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

or

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

// use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
```

### Keeping the query engine binary out of version control by default

Prisma Client is based on a _query engine_ that's running as a sidecar process alongside your application. This query engine _binary_ is downloaded when `prisma generate` is invoked and stored in the `output` path.

By generating Prisma Client into `node_modules`, the query engine is kept out of version control by default (since `node_modules` is typically ignored for version control). If it was not generated into `node_modules`, then you would need to explicitly ignore it, e.g. for Git you'd need to add the `output` path to your `.gitignore` file.

## Generating Prisma Client in the `postinstall` hook of `@prisma/client`

The `@prisma/client` package defines its own `postinstall` hook that's being executed whenever the package is being installed. This hook invokes the `prisma generate` command which in turn generates the Prisma Client code into the default location `node_modules/@prisma/client`. Notice that this requires the `prisma` CLI to be available, either as local dependency or as a global installation (it is recommended to always install the `prisma` package as a development dependency, using `npm install prisma --save-dev`, to avoid versioning conflicts though).
