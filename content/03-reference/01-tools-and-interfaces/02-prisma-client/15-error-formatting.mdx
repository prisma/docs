## Overview

By default, Prisma Client uses [ANSI escape characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) to pretty print the error stack and give recommendations on how to fix a problem. While this is very useful when using Prisma Client from the terminal, in contexts like a GraphQL API, you only want the minimal error without any additional formatting.

This page explains how error formatting can be configured with Prisma Client.

## Formatting levels

There are 3 error formatting levels:

1. **Pretty Error** (default): Includes a full stack trace with colors, syntax highlighting of the code and extended error message with a possible solution for the problem.
2. **Colorless Error**: Same as pretty errors, just without colors.
3. **Minimal Error**: The raw error message.

In order to configure these different error formatting levels, there are two options:

- Setting the config options via environment variables
- Providing the config options to the `PrismaClient` constructor

## Formatting via environment variables

- `NO_COLOR`: If this env var is provided, colors are stripped from the error message. Therefore you end up with a **colorless error**. The `NO_COLOR` environment variable is a standard described [here](https://no-color.org/).
- `NODE_ENV=production`: If the env var `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`, only the **minimal error** will be printed. This allows for easier digestion of logs in production environments.

### Formatting via the `PrismaClient` constructor

The constructor argument to control the error formatting is called `errorFormat`. It can have the following values:

- `undefined`: If it's not defined, the default is `pretty`.
- `pretty`: Enables pretty error formatting.
- `colorless`: Enables colorless error formatting.
- `minimal`: Enables minimal error formatting.

It can be used like so:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  errorFormat: 'minimal',
})
```

As the `errorFormat` property is optional, you still can just instantiate Prisma Client like this:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```
