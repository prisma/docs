## Overview

One of the main features of Prisma Client is its API for sending relation queries. Relation queries refer to queries that operate on a [relation](../prisma-schema/relations) between two or more models:

- Fluent API for traversing relations
- Nested writes with [transactional]() guarantees
- Nested reads (sometimes referred to as _eager loading_) via [`select`](field-selection#select) and [`include`](field-selection#include)
- Relation filters ([filters on related objects](filtering#filter-on-related-records))

This page explains which relation queries exist and how to use them.

The examples on this page based on the following data model:

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts     Post[]
  profile   Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  user    User   @relation(fields:  [userId], references: [id])
  userId  Int
}

model Post {
  id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  author    User?       @relation(fields:  [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
  categories Category[] @relation(references: [id])
}

model Category {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[] @relation(references: [id])
}
```

> **Note**. This schema is the same as the [example data model](../prisma-schema/data-model#example) but has all [scalar fields](../prisma-schema/data-model#scalar-types) removed so you can focus on the relation fields.

## Fluent API

The fluent API lets you _fluently_ traverse the [relations](../prisma-schema/relations) of your models via function calls. Note that the _last_ function call determines the return type of the entire query (the respective type annotations are added in the code snippets below to make that explicit).

This query returns all `Post` records by a specific `User`:

```ts
const postsByUser: Post[] = await prisma.user
  .findOne({ where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' } })
  .posts()
```

Note that this call is equivalent to this Prisma Client query:

```ts
const postsByUser = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: { author: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' } },
})
```

The main difference between the two is that the fluent API call is translated into two separate database queries while the other one only generates a single query (see this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1984)).

This request returns all categories by a specific post:

```ts
const categoriesOfPost: Category[] = await prisma.post.findOne({ where: { id: 1 } }).categories()
```

Note that you can chain as many queries as you like. In this example, the chanining starts at `Profile` and goes over `User` to `Post`:

```ts
const posts: Post[] = await prisma.profile
    .findOne({ where: { id: 1 } })
    .user()
    .posts()
}
```

The only requirement for chaining is that the previous function call must return only a _single object_ (e.g. as returned by a `findOne` query or a "to-one relation" like `profile.user()`).

The following query is **not possible** because `findMany` does not return a single object but a _list_:

```ts
// This query is illegal
const posts = await prisma.user
    .findMany()
    .posts()
}
```

## Relation filters

A [relation filter](filtering#filter-on-related-records) is a filter operation that's applied to a related object of a model. Relation filter options can be passed to the last chained query in a fluent API call if it returns a [list](../prisma-schema/models#type-modifiers).

**Retrieve all `Post` records of a particular `User` record that start with "Hello"**

```ts
const posts: Post[] = await prisma.user
  .findOne({
    where: { email: 'ada@prisma.io' },
  })
  .posts({
    where: {
      title: { startsWith: 'Hello' },
    },
  })
```

Note that this query is _equivalent_ to the following one which is initiated via the `post` instead of the `user` field (in other words, it doesn't use the fluent API):

```ts
const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    author: { email: 'bob@prisma.io' },
    title: { startsWith: 'Hello' },
  },
})
console.log(posts)
```

The main difference between the two is that the fluent API call is translated into two separate database queries while the other one only generates a single query (see this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1984)).

## Nested writes

Nested writes provide a way for writing relational data in your database. They further provide [transactional](transactions) guarantees for creating, updating or deleting data across multiple tables in a single Prisma Client query.

Nested writes can be nested arbitrarily deep.

Nested writes are available for [relation fields](../prisma-schema/relations#relation-fields) when using the model's `create` or `update` query. The following section shows the nested write options that are available per query.

### One-to-one relations

This section shows examples for nested writes on one-to-one relations. It uses the `User` ↔ `Profile` relation from the sample data model above. For illustration purposes, the `email` and `bio` fields have been added:

```prisma
model User {
  id       Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email    String   @unique
  profile  Profile
}

model Profile {
  id      Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio     String
  user    User?   @relation(fields:  [userId], references: [id])
  userId  Int?
}
```

The following nested write options for `Profile` are available in `prisma.user.create(...)` queries:

- `create`: Create a new user and a new profile
- `connect`: Create a new user and connect it to an existing profile

The following nested write options for `Profile` are available in `prisma.user.update(...)` queries:

- `create`: Update an existing user by creating a new profile
- `connect`: Update an an existing user by connecting it to an existing profile
- `update`: Update an existing user by updating their existing profile
- `upsert`: Update an existing user by updating their existing profile or by creating a new profile
- `delete` (only if relation is optional): Update an existing user by deleting their existing profile
- `disconnect` (only if relation is optional): Update an existing user by removing the connection to their existing profile

**Create a new `User` record with a new `Profile` record**:

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    profile: {
      create: { bio: 'Hello World' },
    },
  },
})
```

This example uses the `user` model property, but you could also run the query from the `profile` side:

```ts
const user = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: 'Hello World',
    user: {
      create: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    },
  },
})
```

**Create a new `Profile` record and connect it to an existing `User` record**

```ts
const user = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: 'Hello World',
    user: {
      connect: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    },
  },
})
```

Note that this requires that a `User` record with an `email` of `"alice@prisma.io"` already exists in the database. If that's not the case, the query will fail with an exception.

You can provide any [unique](../prisma-schema/data-model#unique) or [ID](../prisma-schema/data-model#ids) property to the `connect` option, so in this case you could also provide the `id` fied to identify the target `User` record:

```ts
const user = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: 'Hello World',
    user: {
      connect: { id: 42 },
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by creating a new `Profile` record**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    profile: {
      create: { bio: 'Hello World' },
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by connecting it to an existing `Profile` record**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    profile: {
      connect: { id: 24 },
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by updating the `Profile` record it's connected to**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    profile: {
      update: { bio: 'Hello World' },
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by updating the `Profile` record it's connected to or creating a new one (_upsert_)**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    profile: {
      upsert: {
        create: { bio: 'Hello World' },
        update: { bio: 'Hello World' },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by deleting the `Profile` record it's connected to**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    profile: {
      delete: true,
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by disconnecting the `Profile` record it's connected to**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'bob  @prisma.io' },
  data: {
    profile: {
      disconnect: true,
    },
  },
})
```

Note that this query is actually illegal with the data model from above because the `user` field on `Profile` is required. In order to make this query succeed, you'd need to make both relation fields optional:

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  profile   Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  user User?
}
```

### One-to-many relations

This section shows examples for nested writes on one-to-many relations. It uses the `User` ↔ `Post` relation from the sample data model above. For illustration purposes, the `email`, `title` and `published fields have been added:

```prisma
model User {
  id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email    String  @unique
  posts    Post[]
}

model Post {
  id         Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title      String
  published  Boolean  @default(false)
  author     User?
}
```

The following nested write options for `Post` are available in `prisma.user.create(...)` queries:

- `create`: Create a new user and one or more new posts
- `connect`: Create a new user and connect it to one or more existing posts

The following nested write options for `Post` are available in `prisma.post.update(...)` queries:

- `create`: Update an existing user by creating one or more new posts
- `connect`: Update an existing user by connecting it to one or more existing posts
- `update`: Update an existing user by updating one or more of their existing posts
- `upsert`: Update an existing user by updating one or more of their existing posts or by creating one or more new posts
- `delete`: Update an existing user by deleting one or more of their existing posts
- `disconnect`: Update an existing by removing the connection(s) to one or more of their existing posts
- `set`: Update an existing user by replacing their existing posts with one or more existing posts
- `updateMany`: Update an existing user by updating one or more of their existing posts
- `deleteMany`: Update an existing user by deleting one or more of their existing posts

**Create a new `User` record with a new `Post` record**:

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: { title: 'Hello World' },
    },
  },
})
```

This example uses the `user` model property, but you could also run the query from the `post` side:

```ts
const user = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'Hello World',
    author: {
      create: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    },
  },
})
```

**Create a new `User` record with two new `Post` records**:

Because it's a one-to-many relation, you can also create several `Post` records at once by passing an array to `create`:

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: [{ title: 'This is my first post' }, { title: 'Here comes a second post' }],
    },
  },
})
```

**Create a new `Post` record and connect it to an existing `User` record**

```ts
const user = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'Hello World',
    author: {
      connect: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    },
  },
})
```

Note that this requires that a `User` record with an `email` of `"alice@prisma.io"` already exists in the database. If that's not the case, the query will fail with an exception.

You can provide any [unique]() or [ID]() property to the `connect` option, so in this case you could also provide the `id` fied to identify the target `User` record:

```ts
const user = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'Hello World',
    author: {
      connect: { id: 42 },
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by creating a new `Post` record**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    posts: {
      create: { title: 'Hello World' },
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by connecting it to two existing `Post` records**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    posts: {
      connect: [{ id: 24 }, { id: 42 }],
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by updating two `Post` records it's connected to**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    posts: {
      update: [
        {
          data: { published: true },
          where: { id: 32 },
        },
        {
          data: { published: true },
          where: { id: 23 },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by updating two `Post` record it's connected to or creating new ones (_upsert_)**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    posts: {
      upsert: [
        {
          create: { title: 'This is my first post' },
          update: { title: 'This is my first post' },
          where: { id: 32 },
        },
        {
          create: { title: 'This is mt second post' },
          update: { title: 'This is mt second post' },
          where: { id: 23 },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by deleting two `Post` records it's connected to**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    posts: {
      delete: [{ id: 34 }, { id: 36 }],
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by disconnecting two `Post` records it's connected to**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    posts: {
      disconnect: [{ id: 44 }, { id: 46 }],
    },
  },
})
```

**Update an existing `User` record by disconnecting any previous `Post` records and connect two other exiting ones**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    posts: {
      set: [{ id: 32 }, { id: 42 }],
    },
  },
})
```

## Nested reads

With nested reads, you can modify the structures of the model objects that are returned by your Prisma Client queries by _including_ their relations. In ORM terminoloy, this is sometimes called _eager loading_.

You can load relations of your models with the [`include`](field-selection#include) and [`select`](field-selection#select) options which you can pass to _any_ Prisma Client query (except for the batch operations `updateMany` and `deleteMany`). `include` is more commonly used for relations, `select` is used for selecting specific fields.

**Include the `posts` and `profile` relation when loading `User` records**

```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: {
    posts: true,
    profile: true,
  },
})
```

**Include the `posts` relation on the returned objects when creating a new `User` record with two `Post` records**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: [{ title: 'This is my first post' }, { title: 'Here comes a second post' }],
    },
  },
  include: { posts: true },
})
```

**Retrieve deeply nested data by loading several levels of relations**

```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: {
    posts: {
      include: {
        categories: {
          include: {
            posts: true,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```
