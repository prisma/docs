## Overview

Prisma Client allows you to filter records on any combination of model fields, including related models, and supports a variety of relational and logical operators.

For example, the following query returns all `User` records with at least one published post and an email address that ends with `prisma.io`:

```javascript
const filteredUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: 'prisma.io',
    },
    posts: {
      some: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The following queries support filtering:

- `findMany`
- `updateMany`
- `deleteMany`
