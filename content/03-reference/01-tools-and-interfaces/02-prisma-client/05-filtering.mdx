## Overview

The Prisma Client allows you to filter by model fields and supports a variety of relational and logical operators.

You can also filter by related model fields. For example, the following query returns all user records with at least one published post and an email address that ends with `prisma.io`:

```javascript
const x = 'hello';
```

The following methods support filtering:

- `findMany`
- `updateMany`
- `deleteMany`

> **Note**: The `findOne` method supports filtering by unique ID only.
