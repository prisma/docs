## Overview

Prisma Client connects and disconnects from your data sources using the following two methods:

- `connect(): Promise<void>`
- `disconnect(): Promise<void>`

Unless you want to employ a specific optimization, calling `prisma.connect()` is not necessary thanks to the _lazy connect_ behavior: The `PrismaClient` instance connects lazily when the first request is made to the API (`connect()` is called for you under the hood).

If you need the first request to respond instantly and can't wait for the lazy connection to be established, you can explicitly call `prisma.connect()` to establish a connection to the Prisma data source:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// run inside `async` function
await prisma.connect()
```

**Note**: When deploying your application as a long-running process or when running a Node.js script that uses Prisma Client, it's recommended to always explicitly call `prisma.disconnect()` in your code even when an exception is thrown as shown below. Otherwise, the Node.js process will not exit automatically.

> In serverless environments, there are nuances that make it sensible to reuse database connections, i.e. not call `disconnect()`. The [deployment docs](deployment) cover those cases in more detail.

### Calling disconnect explicitly

```ts
main()
  .catch(e => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.disconnect()
  })
```

## `connect`

The `connect` method establishes a physical connection to the database via Prisma's [query engine](query-engine).

Note that `connect` returns a `Promise`, so you shsould call it inside an `async` function with the `await` keyword.

## `disconnect`

The `disconnect` method closes the database connections that were established when `connect` was called and stops the process that was running Prisma's query engine.

Note that `connect` returns a `Promise`, so you should call it inside an `async` function with the `await` keyword.

## Connection pool

Once `connect` was called, the query engine immediately creates a connection pool with the amount of connections that were specified as the `connection_limit` parameter on your database connection URL.

For example, with the following `datasource` configuration in your [Prisma schema](../prisma-schema/prisma-schema-file) the connection pool will have exactly five connections:

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?connection_limit=5"
}
```

If the `connection_limit` argument is omitted, the default number of connections is calculated according to this formula: `num_physical_cpus * 2 + 1` where `num_physical_cpus` represents the number of physical CPUs on your machine.

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb"
}
```

If your machine four physical CPUs, your connection pool will contain nine connections (`4 * 2 + 1 = 9`).
