## Overview

_Module bundlers_ bundle JavaScript modules into a single JavaScript file. Most bundlers work by copying over the JavaScript code from a variety of source files into the target file.

Since Prisma Client is not only based on JavaScript code, but also relies on the [**query engine binary file**](./query-engine#the-query-engine-binary-file) to be available, you need to make sure that your bundled code has access to the binary file.

To do so, you can use plugins that let you copy over static assets:

| Bundler | Plugin                                                                                                  |
