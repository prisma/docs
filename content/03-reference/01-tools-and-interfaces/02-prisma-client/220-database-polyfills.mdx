## Overview

Prisma Client provides features that are typically not achievable with relational databases. These features are referred to as _polyfills_.

- Initializing [ID](../prisma-schema/data-model#ids) values with `cuid` and `uuid` values
- Using [`@updatedAt`](../prisma-schema/data-model#attributes) to store the time when a record was last updated
- [Making 1-1-relations required on both sides](../prisma-schema/relations#one-to-one-relations)
- [Implicit many-to-many relations](../prisma-schema/relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations)
