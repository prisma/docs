## Overview

This section explains how to predict and control which fields of a model are returned in a Prisma Client API call by using the [`select`](#select) and [`include`](#include) options.

Unless otherwise noted, the examples on this page are based on the following Prisma schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id           Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name         String?
  email        String    @unique
  profileViews Int       @default(0)
  role         Role      @default(USER)
  coinflips    Boolean[]
  posts        Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  published Boolean @default(true)
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

## Selection sets

To understand which fields are being returned by a certain Prisma Client query, you need to be aware of its **selection set**.

The selection set defines the **set of fields on a model instance that is returned in a Prisma Client API call**.

Consider the following example `findOne` invocation:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
})
```

The `result` of this API call is a plain old JavaScript object that might look similar to this:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
  email: "alice@prisma.io",
  profileViews: 0,
  role: "ADMIN",
  coinflips: [true, false],
}
```

All the fields that are contained in this object are scalar fields, enums or arrays of scalar fields.

## The default selection set

If the selection set is not manipulated (via `select` or `include`), a Prisma Client API call returns the **default selection set** for a model. It includes all [scalar](../prisma-schema/data-model#scalar-types) fields (including [enums](../prisma-schema/data-model#enums) and arrays/scalar lists) fields of the model.

Considering the sample datamodel from above:

- The default selection set for the `User` model includes `id`, `name`, `email`, `profileViews`, `role` and `coinflips`. It does **not** include `posts` because that's a _relation_ and not a scalar field.
- The default selection set for the `Post` model includes `id`, `title` and `published`. It does **not** include `author` because that's a _relation_ and not a scalar field.

## Manipulating the selection set

There are two ways how the _default selection set_ can be manipulated to specify which fields should be returned by a Prisma Client API call:

- **Select exclusively** (via `select`): When using `select`, the selection set only contains the fields that are explicitly provided as arguments to `select`.
- **Include additionally** (via `include`): When using `include`, the default selection set gets extended with additional fields that are provided as arguments to `include`.

Note that you can nest `select` and `include` statements but they can't be provided right next to ech other. For example, the following combination is allowed:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    id: true,
    name: true,
    posts: {
      include: {
        author: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

And the following one is not allowed because `select` and `include` appear on the same level of nesting right next to each other:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    id: true,
    name: true,
  },
  include: {
    posts: true,
  },
});
```

This case would be caught with the following exceptions:

```
Invalid `prisma.user.findMany()` invocation:

{
  select: {
  ~~~~~~
    id: true,
    name: true
  },
  include: {
  ~~~~~~~
    posts: true
  }
}


Please either use `include` or `select`, but not both at the same time.
```

Both, `select` and `include` are available as options on the following methods:

- [`findOne`](./crud#findOne)
- [`findMany`](./crud#findMany)
- [`create`](./crud#create)
- [`update`](./crud#update)
- [`upsert`](./crud#upsert)
- [`delete`](./crud#delete)

## `select`

When providing the `select` option to a Prisma Client API call, only those fields are included on the returned model object that are explicitly specified. The `select` option is an object that contains _all_ fields of a model with a boolean value indicating whether this field should be included in the response.

### Type

The type of the `select` option is custom for each model. For example, for the `User` and `Post` models from above the types look as follows:

```ts
export type UserSelect = {
  id?: boolean;
  name?: boolean;
  email?: boolean;
  role?: boolean;
  coinflips?: boolean;
  profileViews?: boolean;
  posts?: boolean | FindManyPostArgs;
};

export type PostSelect = {
  id?: boolean;
  title?: boolean;
  published?: boolean;
  author?: boolean | UserArgs;
};
```

The types also contain relation fields which can be even further controlled with specific arguments:

```ts
export type UserArgs = {
  select?: UserSelect | null;
  include?: UserInclude | null;
};

export type FindManyPostArgs = {
  select?: PostSelect | null;
  include?: PostInclude | null;
  where?: PostWhereInput | null;
  orderBy?: PostOrderByInput | null;
  skip?: number | null;
  after?: PostWhereUniqueInput | null;
  before?: PostWhereUniqueInput | null;
  first?: number | null;
  last?: number | null;
};
```

### Examples

In this example, we're using `select` to exclusively select the `name` field of the returned `User` object:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
  select: {
    name: true,
    profileViews: true,
  },
});
```

The `result` object now looks as follows:

```js
{
  name: "Alice",
  profileViews: 0
}
```

You can do the same on any other query listed above, e.g. on `findMany`:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    email: true,
    role: true,
  },
});
```

Since `findMany` returns an array of objects, `result` would now look as follows:

```js
[
  {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    role: 'ADMIN',
  },
  {
    email: 'bob@prisma.io',
    role: 'USER',
  },
];
```

Here's how you can include additional fields of a relation:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    id: true,
    name: true,
    posts: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        title: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In this case, the result might look as follow:

```ts
[
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Alice',
    posts: [
      { id: 1, title: 'Hello World' },
      { id: 2, title: 'Bye bye' },
    ],
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Bob',
    posts: [],
  },
];
```

You can also nest the `include` option inside of the `select` option:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    id: true,
    name: true,
    posts: {
      include: {
        author: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This would result in the following structure for the `result` object:

```js
[
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Alice',
    posts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'Hello World',
        published: true,
        author: {
          id: 1,
          name: 'Alice',
          email: 'alice@prisma.io',
          role: 'ADMIN',
          coinflips: [true, false],
          profileViews: 0,
        },
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        title: 'Bye bye',
        published: false,
        author: {
          id: 1,
          name: 'Alice',
          email: 'alice@prisma.io',
          role: 'USER',
          coinflips: [],
          profileViews: 0,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

Note that the `author` contains all fields of the `User` model's default selection set (scalars, arrays/scalar lists, enums).

## `include`

Sometimes you want to directly include a relation when retrieving data from a database (this is sometimes called "eager loading"). To include the relations of a model in an API call, you can use the `include` options.

### Type

The type of the `include` option is custom for each model. For example, for the `User` and `Post` models from above the types look as follows:

```ts
export type UserInclude = {
  posts?: boolean | FindManyPostArgs;
};

export type PostInclude = {
  author?: boolean | UserArgs;
};
```

The types contain only relation fields which can be even further controlled with specific arguments:

```ts
export type UserArgs = {
  select?: UserSelect | null;
  include?: UserInclude | null;
};

export type FindManyPostArgs = {
  select?: PostSelect | null;
  include?: PostInclude | null;
  where?: PostWhereInput | null;
  orderBy?: PostOrderByInput | null;
  skip?: number | null;
  after?: PostWhereUniqueInput | null;
  before?: PostWhereUniqueInput | null;
  first?: number | null;
  last?: number | null;
};
```

### Examples

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: { posts: true },
});
```

The `result` object in this case contains the default selection set of the `User` model _plus_ its `posts` relation:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
  email: "alice@prisma.io",
  role: "ADMIM",
  coinflips: [true],
  profileViews: 0,
  posts: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: "Hello World",
      published: true
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "Bye bye",
      published: false
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also nest `include` and `select` statements:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: {
    posts: {
      select: {
        published: true,
        title: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This would lead to the following structure of the `result` object:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
  email: "alice@prisma.io",
  role: "USER",
  coinflips: [true],
  profileViews: 0,
  posts: [
    {
      published: true,
      title: "Hello World"
    },
    {
      published: false,
      title: "Bye bye"
    }
  ]
}
```

The nesting and combinations can be arbitrarily deep:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: {
    posts: {
      select: {
        published: true,
        title: true,
        author: {
          select: {
            id: true,
            posts: {
              select: {
                title: true,
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In this case, the `result` object would look as follows:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
  email: "alice@prisma.io",
  role: "USER",
  coinflips: [true],
  profileViews: 0,
  posts: [
    {
      published: true,
      title: "Hello World",
      author: {
        id: 1,
        posts: [
          {
            title: "Hello World"
          },
          {
            title: "Bye bye"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      published: false,
      title: "Bye bye",
      author: {
        id: 1,
        posts: [
          {
            title: "Hello World"
          },
          {
            title: "Bye bye"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
