## Overview

You can enable debugging output in Prisma Client via the `DEBUG` environment variable. It accepts two namespaces to print debugging output:

- `engine`: Prints relevant debug messages happening in a Prisma [engine](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/)
- `prisma-client`: Prints relevant debug messages happening in the Prisma Client runtime

## Setting the `DEBUG` environment variable

Here are examples for setting these debugging options in bash:

```bash
# enable only `engine`-level debugging output
export DEBUG="engine"

# enable only `prisma-client`-level debugging output
export DEBUG="prisma-client"

# enable both `prisma-client`- and `engine`-level debugging output
export DEBUG="prisma-client,engine"
```

If you want to enable all debugging options, you can also set `DEBUG` to `*`:

```bash
export DEBUG="*"
```
