## Overview

This document describes the Prisma CLI commands, arguments, and options.

## Synopsis

The `prisma` command can be called from command line once installed. When called without arguments, it will display its command usage and help document:

```shell
prisma
```

```
◭  Prisma is a modern DB toolkit to query, migrate and model your database (https://prisma.io)

Usage

  $ prisma [command]

Commands

            init   Set up Prisma for your app
      introspect   Get the datamodel of your database
        generate   Generate artifacts (e.g. Prisma Client)

Flags

  --experimental   Show and run experimental Prisma commands

Examples

  Set up a new Prisma project
  $ prisma init

  Introspect an existing database
  $ prisma introspect

  Generate artifacts (e.g. Prisma Client)
  $ prisma generate
```

You can get additional help on any of the `prisma` commands by adding the `--help` flag after the command.

## Commands

### init

Bootstraps a fresh Prisma project within the current directory.

The `init` command does not interpret any existing files. Instead, it creates a `prisma` directory containing a bare-bones `schema.prisma` file within your current directory.

#### Examples

**Run `prisma init`**

```shell
prisma init
```

```
✔ Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma.
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

Next steps:
1. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql or sqlite.
2. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started.
3. Run prisma introspect to turn your database schema into a Prisma data model.
4. Run prisma generate to install Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

More information in our documentation:
https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
```

The command output contains helpful information on how to use the generated files and begin using Prisma with your project.

#### Generated Assets

**`prisma/schema.prisma`**

A minimal `schema.prisma` file to define your schema in:

```prisma
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

**`prisma/.env`**

A file to define environment variables for your project:

```
# Environment variables declared in this file are automatically made available to Prisma.
# See the documentation for more detail: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema#using-environment-variables

# Prisma supports the native connection string format for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite.
# See the documentation for all the connection string options: https://pris.ly/d/connection-strings

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:johndoe@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
```

### generate

The `generate` command generates assets like Prisma Client based on the [`generator`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/docs/prisma-schema-file.md#generators-optional) and [`model`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/docs/data-modeling.md) blocks defined in your `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

The `generate` command is most often used to generate Prisma Client with the `prisma-client-js` generator. This does three things:

1. Searches the current directory and parent directories to find the applicable `npm` project. It will create a `package.json` file in the current directory if it cannot find one.
2. Installs the `@prisma/client` into the `npm` project if it is not already present.
3. Inspects the current directory to find a Prisma schema file to process. It will then generate a customized [Prisma Client](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js) for your project.

#### Prerequisites

To use the `generate` command, you must add a generator definition in your `schema.prisma` file. The `prisma-client-js` generator, used to generate Prisma Client, can be added by including the following in your `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

#### Options

The `generate` command recognizes the following options to modify its behavior:

| Option     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                         | Default                                     |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `--schema` | No       | Specifies the path to the desired `schema.prisma` file to be processed instead of the default path. Both absolute and relative paths are supported. | `./schema.prisma`, `./prisma/schema.prisma` |
| `--watch`  | No       | The `generate` command will continue to watch the `schema.prisma` file and re-generate Prisma Client on file changes.                               |

#### Examples

**Generate Prisma Client using the default `schema.prisma` path**

```shell
prisma generate
```

✔ Generated Prisma Client to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 61ms

You can now start using Prisma Client in your code:

```
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
// or const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

Explore the full API: http://pris.ly/d/client

**Generate Prisma Client using a non-default `schema.prisma` path**

```shell
prisma generate --schema=./alternative/schema.prisma
```

**Continue watching the `schema.prisma` file for changes to automatically re-generate Prisma Client**

```shell
prisma generate --watch
```

```
Watching... /home/prismauser/prisma/prisma-play/prisma/schema.prisma

✔ Generated Prisma Client to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 45ms
```

#### Generated Assets

The `prisma-client-js` generator creates a customized client for working with your database within the `./node_modules/@prisma/client` directory.

### introspect

The `introspect` command connects to your database and adds Prisma models to your Prisma schema that reflect the current database schema.

To run the `introspect` command, a `schema.prisma` file with a valid [`datasource`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/docs/prisma-schema-file.md#data-sources) must be available.

> Warning: The command will overwrite the current `schema.prisma` file with the new schema. Any manual changes or customization will be lost. Be sure to back up your current `schema.prisma` file before running `introspect` if it contains important modifications.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the `introspect` command, you must define a [valid `datasource`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/docs/prisma-schema-file.md#data-sources) within your `schema.prisma` file.

For example, the following `datasource` defines an SQLite database file within the current directory:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:my-database.db"
}
```

#### Options

The `introspect` command recognizes the following options to modify its behavior:

| Option     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                         | Default                                     |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `--schema` | No       | Specifies the path to the desired `schema.prisma` file to be processed instead of the default path. Both absolute and relative paths are supported. | `./schema.prisma`, `./prisma/schema.prisma` |
| `--print`  | No       | Prints the created `schema.prisma` to the screen instead of writing it to the filesystem.                                                           |

#### Examples

**Analyze the database and write its schema to the `schema.prisma` file**

```shell
prisma introspect
```

```
Introspecting based on datasource defined in schema.prisma …

✔ Wrote Prisma data model into schema.prisma in 38ms

Run prisma generate to generate Prisma Client.
```

**Specify an alternative `schema.prisma` file to read and write to**

```shell
prisma introspect --schema=./alternative/schema.prisma
```

```
Introspecting based on datasource defined in alternative/schema.prisma …

✔ Wrote Prisma data model into alternative/schema.prisma in 60ms

Run prisma generate to generate Prisma Client.
```

**Display the generated `schema.prisma` file instead of writing it to the filesystem**

```shell
prisma introspect --print
```

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "sqlite:./hello-prisma.db"
}

model User {
  email   String    @unique
  name    String?
  user_id Int       @default(autoincrement()) @id
  post    Post[]
  profile Profile[]
}

model Post {
  content   String?
  post_id   Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title     String
  author_id User?
}

model Profile {
  bio        String?
  profile_id Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  user_id    User
}
```

## Migrations (Experimental)

> Warning: The `migrate` command is still considered experimental. As such, there are no guarantees about API stability or production-readiness. Access to this command is provided for evaluation and experimentation. To access experimental commands, you must add the `--experimental` flag.

The `migrate` command creates and manages database migrations. It can be used to create, apply, and rollback database schema updates in a controlled manner.

The `migrate` command includes a number of subcommands to specify the desired action.

### migrate save

Saves a migration that defines the steps necessary to update your current schema.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the `migrate save` command, you must define a [valid `datasource`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/docs/prisma-schema-file.md#data-sources) within your `schema.prisma` file.

For example, the following `datasource` defines an SQLite database file within the current directory:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:my-database.db"
}
```

#### Options

The `migrate save` command recognizes the following options to modify its behavior:

| Option              | Required | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--experimental`    | Yes      | Enables use of experimental commands.                                                      |
| `-n`, `--name`      | No       | The name of the migration. If not provided, `migrate save` will prompt you for a name.     |
| `-c`, `--create-db` | No       | Create the database if it does not exist.                                                  |
| `-p`, `--preview`   | No       | Preview the migration that would be created without writing any changes to the filesystem. |

#### Generated Assets

The `migrate save` command generates the following directories and files as necessary:

- `migrations`: A directory within the current project to store migrations. This directory will be created if it does not exist.
- `migrations/migrate.lock`: A lock file created specifying the current migration applied to the database. This file will be created if it does not exist.
- `migrations/<migration>`: A directory for a specific migration. The migration name is derived from the timestamp when it was created followed by a hyphen and the migration name provided by the user.
- `migrations/<migration>/README.md`: A human-readable description of the migration including metadata like when the migration was created and by who, a list of the actual migration changes and a diff of the changes that are made to the `schema.prisma` file.
- `migrations/<migration>/schema.prisma`: The schema that will be created if the migration is applied to the project.
- `migrations/<migration>/steps.json`: An [alternative representation](https://github.com/prisma/specs/tree/master/lift#step) of the migration steps that will be applied.

#### Examples

**Create a new migration**

```shell
prism2 migrate save --experimental
```

The command will prompt you for a name for the migration since one was not provided on the command line. After creating the migration, the contents of the generated `schema.prisma` file are displayed.

**Create a migration with a specific name**

```shell
prism2 migrate save --name "First migration" --experimental
```

**Create the database if it does not already exist**

```shell
prism2 migrate save --create-db --experimental
```

**Preview the migration that would be created by running the `migrate save` command**

```shell
prism2 migrate save --preview --experimental
```

### migrate up

Migrate the database up to a specific state.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the `migrate up` command, you must define a [valid `datasource`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/docs/prisma-schema-file.md#data-sources) within your `schema.prisma` file.

For example, the following `datasource` defines an SQLite database file within the current directory:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:my-database.db"
}
```

#### Arguments

The point to migrate the database up to can be defined in any of the following three ways:

| Argument  | Required | Description                                                                        | Default |

| timestamp | No       | Specifies where to migrate to using the timestamp of the final migration to apply. | latest  |

#### Options

Additionally, the following options modify the behavior of the `migrate up` command:

| Option              | Required | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--experimental`    | Yes      | Enables use of experimental commands                                                       |
| `-c`, `--create-db` | No       | Create the database if it does not exist.                                                  |
| `-p`, `--preview`   | No       | Preview the migration that would be created without writing any changes to the filesystem. |

#### Examples

**Migrate the database up to the latest available migration**

```shell
prisma migrate up --experimental
```

**Apply the next two migrations to the database**

```shell
prisma migrate up 2 --experimental
```

**Apply all migrations necessary up to and including a migration by name**

```shell
prisma migrate up "First migration" --experimental
```

**Apply all migrations necessary up to and including a migration by timestamp**

```shell
prisma migrate up 20200223181448 --experimental
```

**Create the database if it does not already exist before applying the migrations**

```shell
prisma migrate up --create-db --experimental
```

**Preview the migration that would be applied by running the `migrate up` command**

```shell
prisma migrate up --preview --experimental
```

### migrate down

Migrate the database down to a specific state.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the `migrate down` command, you must define a [valid `datasource`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/docs/prisma-schema-file.md#data-sources) within your `schema.prisma` file.

For example, the following `datasource` defines an SQLite database file within the current directory:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:my-database.db"
}
```

#### Arguments

The point to migrate back to can be defined in any of the following three ways:

| Argument  | Required | Description                                                                             | Default |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| decrement | No       | Specifies the number of backwards migrations to apply.                                  | 1       |

| `-p`, `--preview` | No       | Preview the migration that would be created without writing any changes to the filesystem. |

#### Examples

**Migrate the database backwards by a single migration**

```shell
prisma migrate down --experimental
```

**Migrate the database backwards by two migrations**

```shell
prisma migrate down 2 --experimental
```

**Migrate backwards through all migrations up to and including a migration by name**

```shell
prisma migrate down "First migration" --experimental
```

**Migrate backwards through all migrations up to and including a migration by timestamp**

```shell
prisma migrate down 20200223181448 --experimental
```

**Preview the migration that would be applied by running the `migrate down` command**

```shell
prisma migrate down --preview --experimental
```

## Studio (Experimental)

### studio

> Warning: The `studio` command is still considered experimental. As such, there are no guarantees about API stability or production-readiness. Access to this command is provided for evaluation and experimentation. To access experimental commands, you must add the `--experimental` flag.

The `studio` command allows you to interact with and manage your data interactively. It does this by starting a local web server with a web app configured with your project's data schema and records.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the `studio` command, you must define a [valid `datasource`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/docs/prisma-schema-file.md#data-sources) within your `schema.prisma` file.

For example, the following `datasource` defines an SQLite database file within the current directory:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:my-database.db"
}
```

#### Options

The `studio` command recognizes the following options:

| Option           | Required | Description                          | Default |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `--experimental` | Yes      | Enables use of experimental commands |
| `-p`, `--port`   | No       | The port number to start Studio on.  | 5555    |

#### Examples

**Start Studio on the default port and open a new browser tab to it**

```shell
prisma studio --experimental
```

**Start Studio on a different port and open a new browser tab to it**

```shell
prisma studio --port 7777 --experimental
```
