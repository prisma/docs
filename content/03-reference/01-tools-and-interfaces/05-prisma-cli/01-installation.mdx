## Overview

The Prisma CLI is available as an [npm package](). It is **recommended to install the Prisma CLI locally** in your project's `package.json` to avoid version conflicts.


### Local installation (recommended)

The Prisma 2 CLI is typically installed as a **development dependency**, that's why the `--save-dev` (npm) and `--dev` (Yarn) options are used in the commands below.

#### npm

Install with npm:

```
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
```

This should add `@prisma/cli` to the `devDependencies` in your `package.json`. You can then invoke the locally installed CLI with the **`prisma`** command prefixed with [`npx`](https://github.com/npm/npx#readme):

```
npx prisma
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
npx prisma generate
```

#### Yarn

Install with Yarn:

```
yarn add @prisma/cli --dev
```

This should add `@prisma/cli` to the `devDependencies` in your `package.json`. You can then invoke the locally installed CLI with the **`prisma`** command prefixed with `yarn`:

```
yarn prisma
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
yarn prisma generate
```

### Global installation (not recommended)

While it is recommended to [locally install](#local-installation-recommended) the Prisma 2 CLI, you can also install it globally on your machine.

> **Warning**: If you have several Prisma projects on your machine, a global installation can lead to version conflicts between these projects.

#### npm

Install with npm:

```
npm install -g @prisma/cli
```

You can then invoke the globally installed CLI with the **`prisma`** command like so:

```
prisma
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
prisma generate
```

#### Yarn

Install with Yarn:

```
yarn global add @prisma/cli
```

You can then invoke the globally installed CLI with the **`prisma`** command like so:

```
prisma
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
prisma generate
```

### The `postinstall` hook

When installing Prisma 2 CLI, a [`postinstall`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/cli/sdk/package.json#L13) hook is being executed. It downloads Prisma 2's query and migration [engine binaries](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engine). The query engine contains the [Prisma schema](../prisma-schema/prisma-schema-file) parser which is used by the `prisma init` and the `prisma generate` commands. The migration engine is used by all `prisma migrate` commands.

## Using a HTTP proxy for the CLI

Prisma 2 CLI supports [custom HTTP proxies](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/506). This is particularly relevant when being behind a corporate firewall.

To activate the proxy, provide the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and/or `HTTPS_PROXY`. The behavior is very similar to how the [`npm` CLI handles this](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#https-proxy).

The following environment variables can be provided:

- `HTTP_PROXY` or `http_proxy`: Proxy URL for http traffic, for example `http://localhost:8080`
- `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy`: Proxy URL for https traffic, for example `https://localhost:8080`

> To get a local proxy, you can also use the [`proxy`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy) module:
