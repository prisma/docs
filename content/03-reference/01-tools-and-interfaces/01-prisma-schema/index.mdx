## Overview

The Prisma schema file (short: _schema file_, _Prisma schema_ or _schema_) is the main configuration file for your Prisma setup. It is typically called `schema.prisma` and consists of the following parts:

- [**Data sources**](data-sources): Specify the details of the data sources Prisma should connect to (e.g. a PostgreSQL database)
- [**Generators**](generators): Specifies what clients should be generated based on the data model (e.g. Prisma Client)
- [**Data model definition**](data-model): Specifies your application [models](models) (the shape of the data per data source) and their [relations](relations)

Whenever a `prisma` command is invoked, the CLI typically reads some information from the schema file, e.g.:

- `prisma generate`: Reads _all_ above mentioned information from the Prisma schema to generate the correct data source client code (e.g. Prisma Client).
- `prisma migrate save --experimental`: Reads the data sources and data model definition to create a new migration.

You can also [use environment variables](#using-environment-variables) inside the schema file to provide configuration options when a CLI command is invoked.

## Example

Here is an example for a Prisma schema file that specifies a data source (PostgreSQL), a generator (Prisma Client) and a data model definition with two models (with one relation) and one enum:

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  provider = "postgresql"
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  role      Role     @default(USER)
  posts     Post[]
}

model Post {
  id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt  DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime   @updatedAt
  published  Boolean    @default(false)
  title      String
  author     User?      @relation(fields:  [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId   Int?
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

## Naming

The default name for the schema file is `schema.prisma`. When your schema file is named like this, the Prisma CLI will detect it automatically in the directory where you invoke the CLI command (or any of its subdirectories).

If the file is named differently, you can provide the `--schema` argument to the Prisma CLI with the path to the schema file, e.g.:

```
prisma generate --schema ./database/myschema.prisma
```

## Syntax

The schema file is written in Prisma Schema Language (PSL). You can find a full reference for PSL in the [spec](https://github.com/prisma/specs/tree/master/schema).

### VS Code

Syntax highlighting for PSL is available via a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) (which also lets you auto-format the contents of your Prisma schema and indicates syntax errors with red squiggly lines). Learn more about [setting up Prisma in your editor](../../more/editor-setup).

### GitHub

PSL code snippets on GitHub can be rendered with syntax highlighting as well by using the `.prisma` file extension or annotating fenced code blocks in Markdown with `prisma`:

````
```prisma
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
}
```
````

## Using environment variables

You can use environment variables to provide configuration options when a CLI command is invoked. This can e.g. be helpful in order to:

- Keep secrets out of the schema file
- Improve portability of the schema file

### Defining environment variables with the env function

Environment variables can be accessed using the `env` function:

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

There are a few limitations with `env` at the moment:

- It is not possible to use string concat operations (e.g. to construct your database connection string).
- It is not possible to use environment variables for the `provider` argument in `datasource` and `generator` definitions.

### Using .env files

For many developer tools, it has become a good practice to define environment variables using [`.env`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) files.

Prisma provides native support for `.env` files **if the `.env` file is located in the same directory as your Prisma schema file**:

```
.
└── prisma
    ├── .env
    └── schema.prisma
```

This means any environment variables defined in that `.env` file will automatically be loaded when running a Prisma CLI command.

> **WARNING**: Do not commit your `.env` files into version control.

For example, it is a common scenario to set your database connection URL via an environment variable:

```prisma
// schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

This requires the `DATABASE_URL` to be set in your `.env` file:

```
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test?schema=public
```

When running any command that needs to access the database defined via the `datasource` block (e.g. `prisma introspect`), the Prisma CLI automatically loads the `DATABASE_URL` environment variables from the `.env` file and makes it available to the CLI.

If you want environment variables to be evaluated at runtime, you need to load them manually in your application code, e.g. using [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv):

```ts
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config() // load the environment variables
console.log(`The connection URL is ${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`)
```

### Use multiple .env files or .env files outside the prisma folder

To use multiple `.env` files:

1.  Install [dotenv-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli):

    ```
    npm install -g dotenv-cli
    ```

2.  Create a file - for example, `.env3` - in your project's root folder.

3.  To use the `.env3` file, you can either:

    - Include a reference to `dotenv` at the top of your project's entry file.

    ```ts
    import { config } from 'dotenv'
    config({ path: '.env3' })
    ```

    - Use `dotenv` when you run any Prisma command and specify which `.env` file to use. The following example uses a file named `.env3`:

    ```
    dotenv -e .env3 npx prisma introspect
    ```

## Comments

There are two types of comments that are supported in the schema file:

- `// comment`: This comment is for the reader's clarity and is not present in the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the schema file.
- `/// comment`: These comments will show up in the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the schema file, either as descriptions to AST nodes or as free-floating comments. Tools can then use these comments to provide additional information.

Here are some different examples:

```prisma
  /// This comment will get attached to the `User` node in the AST
  model User {
  /// This comment will get attached to the `id` node in the AST
  id      Int    @default(autoincrement())
  // This comment is just for you
  weight  Float /// This comment gets attached to the `weight` node
  }

  // This comment is just for you. It will not
  // show up in the AST.

  /// This is a free-floating comment that will show up
  /// in the AST as a `Comment` node, but is not attached
  /// to any other node. We can use these for documentation
  /// in the same way that godoc.org works.

  model Customer {}
```

## Auto formatting

Similar to tools like [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), PSL syntax ships with a formatter for
`.prisma` files. The formatter can be enabled in the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma).

Like `gofmt` and unlike `prettier`, there are no options for configuration here. **There is exactly one way to format a prisma file**.

Learn more about the formatting rules in the [spec](https://github.com/prisma/specs/tree/master/schema#formatting-rules).
