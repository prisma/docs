## Overview

The Prisma schema file (short: _schema file_, _Prisma schema_ or _schema_) is the main configuration file for your Prisma setup. It is typically called `schema.prisma` and consists of the following parts:

- [**Data sources**](data-sources): Specify the details of the data sources Prisma should connect to (e.g. a PostgreSQL database)
- [**Generators**](generators): Specifies what clients should be generated based on the data model (e.g. Prisma Client)
- [**Data model definition**](data-model): Specifies your application [models](data-model#defining-models) (the shape of the data per data source) and their [relations](relations)

Whenever a `prisma` command is invoked, the CLI typically reads some information from the schema file, e.g.:

- `prisma generate`: Reads _all_ above mentioned information from the Prisma schema to generate the correct data source client code (e.g. Prisma Client).
- `prisma migrate save --experimental`: Reads the data sources and data model definition to create a new migration.

You can also [use environment variables](#using-environment-variables) inside the schema file to provide configuration options when a CLI command is invoked.

## Example

Here is an example for a Prisma schema file that specifies a data source (PostgreSQL), a generator (Prisma Client) and a data model definition with two models (with one relation) and one enum:

```prisma
datasource db {
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  provider = "postgresql"
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  role      Role     @default(USER)
  posts     Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  title     String
  author    User?    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

## Naming

The default name for the schema file is `schema.prisma`. When your schema file is named like this, the Prisma CLI will detect it automatically in the directory where you invoke the CLI command (or any of its subdirectories).

If the file is named differently, you can provide the `--schema` argument to the Prisma CLI with the path to the schema file, e.g.:

```
prisma generate --schema ./database/myschema.prisma
```

## Syntax

The schema file is written in Prisma Schema Language (PSL). You can find a full reference for PSL in the [spec](https://github.com/prisma/specs/tree/master/schema).

### VS Code

Syntax highlighting for PSL is available via a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) (which also lets you auto-format the contents of your Prisma schema and indicates syntax errors with red squiggly lines). Learn more about [setting up Prisma in your editor](../../more/editor-setup).

### GitHub

PSL code snippets on GitHub can be rendered with syntax highlighting as well by using the `.prisma` file extension or annotating fenced code blocks in Markdown with `prisma`:

````
```prisma
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
}
```
````

## Using environment variables

You can use environment variables to provide configuration options when a CLI command is invoked. Environment variables allow you to:

- Keep secrets out of the schema file
- Improve portability of the schema file

You can use machine-specific variables, `.env` files, or a combination of both.

### Accessing environment variables from the schema

Environment variables can be accessed using the `env` function:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Variables can be expanded using the format specified by [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand).

There are a few limitations with `env` at the moment:

- It is not possible to use environment variables for the `provider` argument in `datasource` and `generator` definitions.

### Using .env files

For many developer tools, it has become a good practice to define environment variables using [`.env`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) files. The Prisma CLI expects to find the `.env` file:

1. Next to your schema file
2. In the `./prisma` folder, if it is not found next to your schema file

The following table describes where the Prisma CLI looks for the `.env` file:

| **Command**                                     | **Schema file location**                                                        | **`.env` file locations checked, in order**    |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `prisma [command]`                              | `./prisma/schema.prisma`                                                        | `./prisma/.env`                                |
| `prisma [command] --schema=./a/b/schema.prisma` | `./a/b/schema.prisma`                                                           | `./folder/subfolder/.env`<br />`./prisma/.env` |
| `prisma [command]`                              | No schema (for example, when running `prisma introspect` in an empty directory) | `./prisma/.env`                                |

Any environment variables defined in that `.env` file will automatically be loaded when running a Prisma CLI command.

> **Warning**: Do not commit your `.env` files into version control.

Refer to the `dotenv` documentation for information about [what happens if an environment variable is defined in two places](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#what-happens-to-environment-variables-that-were-already-set).

#### Example: Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in an `.env` file

It is common to load your database connection URL from an environment variable:

```prisma
// schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

You can set the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file:

```
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test?schema=public
```

When you run a command that needs access the database defined via the `datasource` block (for example, `prisma introspect`), the Prisma CLI automatically loads the `DATABASE_URL` environment variables from the `.env` file and makes it available to the CLI.

### Using environment variables in your code

If you want environment variables to be evaluated at runtime, you need to load them manually in your application code (for example, by using [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)):

```ts
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config() // Load the environment variables
console.log(`The connection URL is ${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`)
```

### Manage `.env` files manually

You can use `dotenv-cli` if you want to:

- Use multiple `.env` files
- Use `.env` files from a location that the Prisma CLI does not check [by default](#using-env-files)

#### Via command line

1.  Install [`dotenv-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli):

    ```
    npm install -g dotenv-cli
    ```

2.  Create a file - for example, `.env3` - in your project's root folder.

3.  To use the `.env3` file, you can use `dotenv` when you run any Prisma command and specify which `.env` file to use. The following example uses a file named `.env3`:

    ```
    dotenv -e .env3 -- npx prisma introspect
    ```

> **Note:** dotenv doesn't pass the flags to the Prisma command by default, this is why the command includes two dashes `--` before `prisma`, making it possible to use flags like `--force`, `--schema` or `--experimental`.  

#### Via application code

1.  Add [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to your project:

    ```
    npm install dotenv
    ```

2.  Create a file - for example, `.env3` - in your project's root folder.

3.  To use the `.env3` file, include a reference to `dotenv` at the top of your project's entry file.

    ```ts
    import { config } from 'dotenv'
    config({ path: '.env3' })
    ```

## Comments

There are two types of comments that are supported in the schema file:

- `// comment`: This comment is for the reader's clarity and is not present in the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the schema file.
- `/// comment`: These comments will show up in the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the schema file, either as descriptions to AST nodes or as free-floating comments. Tools can then use these comments to provide additional information.

Here are some different examples:

```prisma
  /// This comment will get attached to the `User` node in the AST
model User {
  /// This comment will get attached to the `id` node in the AST
  id      Int    @default(autoincrement())
  // This comment is just for you
  weight  Float /// This comment gets attached to the `weight` node
}

  // This comment is just for you. It will not
  // show up in the AST.

  /// This is a free-floating comment that will show up
  /// in the AST as a `Comment` node, but is not attached
  /// to any other node. We can use these for documentation
  /// in the same way that godoc.org works.

model Customer {}
```

## Auto formatting

Similar to tools like [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), PSL syntax ships with a formatter for
`.prisma` files. The formatter can be enabled in the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma).

Like `gofmt` and unlike `prettier`, there are no options for configuration here. **There is exactly one way to format a prisma file**.

Learn more about the formatting rules in the [spec](https://github.com/prisma/specs/tree/master/schema#formatting-rules).
