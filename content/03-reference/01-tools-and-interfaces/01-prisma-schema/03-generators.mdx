<TopBlock>

A generator determines which assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command, including:

* The **client language** (currently only `prisma-client-js` is available)
* Target **engine binaries** (for example, `debian-openssl-1.0.x` if you are deploying to Ubuntu 14.04, or `native` if you are working locally)

Each Prisma schema has one generator, represented by the [`generator`](prisma-schema-reference#generator) <span class="api"></span> block:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["linux-msl"]
}
```

</TopBlock>

## Binary targets

Prisma uses several [engine binaries](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). For example:

* **Prisma Client** uses the [query engine binary file](../prisma-client/query-engine) under the hood to communicate with a database. 
* **Prisma Migrate** uses the migration engine binary file to run schema migrations against a database.

Engines are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma in the form of executable _binary files_.

The binary file is particularly important when [deploying](../prisma-client/deployment) your application to production.

### The native binary target

The `native` binary target is special. It doesn't map to a concrete operating system. Instead, when `native` is specified in `binaryTargets`, Prisma detects the _current_ operating system and automatically specifies the correct binary target for it.

As an example, assume you're running **Mac OS** and you specify the following generator:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

In that case, Prisma detects your operating system and finds the right binary file for it based on the table [above](#supported-operating-systems). As you're running Mac OS, the binary file that was compiled for `darwin` will be selected.

### Custom binary targets

You can use environment variables to [specify a custom binary](../../../understand-prisma/under-the-hood#using-custom-engine-binaries) for one or more engines.
