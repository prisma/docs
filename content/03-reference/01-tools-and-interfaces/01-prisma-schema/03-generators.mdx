<TopBlock>

A generator determines which assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command, including:

* The **Prisma client (language specific)** (currently only `prisma-client-js` is available)
  
  * Target **engine binaries** for `prisma-client-js`  (for example, `debian-openssl-1.0.x` if you are deploying to Ubuntu 14.04, or `native` if you are working locally)

* Preview features to include
* A custom output folder for the generated assets

A Prisma schema can have one or more generators, represented by the [`generator`](prisma-schema-reference#generator) <span class="api"></span> block:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["linux-msl"]
  previewFeatures = ["sample-preview-feature"]
}
```

## Binary targets (`prisma-client-js`)

Prisma Client JS  (prisma-client-js) uses several [engine binaries](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). For example:

* **Prisma Client** uses the [query engine binary file](../prisma-client/query-engine) under the hood to communicate with a database. 
* **Prisma Migrate** uses the migration engine binary file to run schema migrations against a database.

Engines are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma in the form of executable _binary files_.

The binary file is particularly important when [deploying](../prisma-client/deployment) your application to production.

### The native binary target

The `native` binary target is special. It doesn't map to a concrete operating system. Instead, when `native` is specified in `binaryTargets`, Prisma detects the _current_ operating system and automatically specifies the correct binary target for it.

As an example, assume you're running **Mac OS** and you specify the following generator:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

In that case, Prisma detects your operating system and finds the right binary file for it based on the [list of supported operating systems](prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) <span class="api"></span>. As you're running Mac OS, the binary file that was compiled for `darwin` will be selected.

### Custom binary targets

You can use environment variables to [specify a custom binary](../../../understand-prisma/under-the-hood#using-custom-engine-binaries) for one or more engines.
