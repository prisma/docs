A data source determines how Prisma connects your database, and is represented by the [`datasource`](prisma-schema-reference#inlinecodedatasourceinlinecode) <span class="api"></span> block in the Prisma schema. The following data source uses the `postgresql` provider and includes a connection string:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
}
```

A Prisma schema can only have *one* data source. However, you can:

* Specify [multiple providers](#multiple-providers)
* [Programmatically override a data source `url`](../prisma-client/constructor#datasources)

</TopBlock>

## Multiple providers

The `provider` field accepts an array of providers:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = ["postgresql", "mysql"]
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Prisma uses the provider that is compatible with the the value of the `url` field. Use cases for multiple providers include:

* You have multiple environments (development, QA, production) and each environment uses a different provider
