Some features are released as **preview features** first. Preview features:

* Are expected to work but would benefit from field testing by the community
* Are **not** considered ready for production
* Must be enabled via a preview feature flag

You can help us accelerate the release of preview features by [sharing your feedback on GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3108).
