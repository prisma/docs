## Troubleshooting

### Failed to run script / Error in Prisma Client request

Caching issues may cause Prisma Studio to use an older version of the query engine. You may see the following error: 

```
Error in request:  PrismaClientKnownRequestError: Failed to validate the query Error occurred during query validation & transformation
```

To resolve, delete the following folders:

* `~/.cache/prisma` on macOS and Linux
* `%AppData%/Prisma/Studio` on Windows
