## Overview

The SQLite data source connector connects Prisma to a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database file. These files always have the file ending `.db` (e.g.: `dev.db`).

## Example

To connect to a SQLite database file, you need to configure a [`datasource`]() block in your [schema file]():

```prisma
datasource sqlite {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}
```

The fields passed to the `datasource` block are:

- `provider`: Specifies the `sqlite` data source connector.
- `url`: Specifies the [connection URL](./connection-urls) for the SQLite database. The connection URL always starts with the prefix `file:` and then contains a file path pointing to the SQLite database file. In this case, the file is located in the same directory and called `dev.db`.

## Data model mapping

The SQLite connector maps the [scalar types](..//prisma-schema/data-model#scalar-types) from the [data model](..//prisma-schema/data-model) to native column types as follows:

| Data model | SQLite    |
| ---------- | --------- |
| `String`   | `TEXT`    |
| `Boolean`  | `BOOLEAN` |
| `Int`      | `INTEGER` |
| `Float`    | `REAL`    |

## Connection details

### Connection URL

The connection URL of a SQLite connector points to a file on your file system. For example, the following two paths are equivalent because the `.db` iss in the same directory:

```prisma
datasource sqlite {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}
```

is the same as:

```prisma
datasource sqlite {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:dev.db"
}
```

You can also target files from the root or any other place in your file system:

```prisma
datasource sqlite {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:/Users/janedoe/dev.db"
}
```
