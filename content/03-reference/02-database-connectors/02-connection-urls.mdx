## Overview

Prisma needs a connection URL to be able to connect to your database, e.g. when sending queries with [Prisma Client](../tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/api) or when changing the database schema with [Prisma Migrate](../tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate).

The connection URL is provided via the `url` field of a `datasource` block in your Prisma schema. It generally consists of the following components (except for SQLite):

- **User**: The name of your database user
- **Password**: The password for your database user
- **Host**: The IP or domain name of the machine where your database server is running
- **Port**: The port on which your database server is running
- **Database name**: The name of the database you want to use

Make sure you have this information at hand when getting started with Prisma. If you don't have a database server running yet, you can either use a local SQLite database file (see the [Quickstart](../../getting-started/quickstart)) or [setup a free PostgreSQL database on Heroku](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1).

## Examples

Here are examples for the connection URLs of the databases Prisma supports:

**PostgreSQL**

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb"
}
```

**MySQL**

```prisma
datasource mysql {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/mydb"
}
```

**SQLite**

```prisma
datasource mysql {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}
```

Note that you can also provide the connection URL as an environment variable like so:

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

You can then either set the environment variable in your terminal or by providing a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file called `.env`. This will automatically be picked up by the Prisma CLI.

**.env**

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb
```

## Format

The format of the connection URL depends on the _database connector_ you're using. Prisma generally supports the standard formats for each database. You can find out more about the connection URL of your database on the dedicated docs page:

- [PostgreSQL](postgresql)
- [MySQL](mysql)
- [SQLite](sqlite)
