## Overview

The PostgreSQL data source connector connects Prisma to a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server.

## Example

To connect to a PostgreSQL database server, you need to configure a [`datasource`](../prisma-schema/data-sources) block in your [Prisma schema file](../prisma-schema/prisma-schema-file):

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The fields passed to the `datasource` block are:

- `provider`: Specifies the `postgresql` data source connector.
- `url`: Specifies the [connection URL](#connection-url) for the PostgreSQL database server. In this case, an [environment variable is used](../prisma-schema/prisma-schema-file#using-environment-variables) to provide the connection URL.

## Connection details

### Connection URL

Prisma follows the [official PostgreSQLl format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) for connection URLs. Here's an overview of the components needed for a PostgreSQL connection URL:

**Base URL and path**

Here is an example of the structure of the _base URL_ and the _path_ using placeholder values in uppercase letters:

```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
```

The following components make up the _base URL_ of your database, they are always required:

| Name     | Placeholder | Description                                                 |
| :------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host     | `HOST`      | IP address/domain of your database server, e.g. `localhost` |
| Port     | `PORT`      | Port on which your database server is running, e.g. `5432`  |
| User     | `USER`      | Name of your database user, e.g. `janedoe`                  |
| Password | `PASSWORD`  | Password for your database user                             |
| Database | `DATABASE`  | Name of the [database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/manage-ag-overview.html) you want to use, e.g. `mydb`       |

**Arguments**

A connection URL can also take arguments. Here is the same example from above with placeholder values in uppercase letters for three _arguments_:

```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?KEY1=VALUE&KEY2=VALUE&KEY3=VALUE
```

The following arguments can be used

| Argument name      | Required | Default                | Description                                                                    |
| :----------------- | :------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `schema`           | **Yes**  | `public`               | Name of the [schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-schemas.html) you want to use, e.g. `myschema`                            |
| `connection_limit` | No       | `num_cpus * 2 + 1`     | Maximum size of the [connection pool](../prisma-client/connection-management#connection-pool))                                        |
| `connect_timeout`  | No       | `5`                    | Maximum number of seconds to wait for a new connection                         |
| `socket_timeout`   | No       | `5`                    | Maximum number of seconds to wait until a single query terminates              |
| `sslmode`          | No       | `prefer`               | Configures whether to use TLS, possible values: `prefer`, `disable`, `require` |
| `sslcert`          | No       |                        | Path the the server certificate                                                |
| `sslidentity`      | No       |                        | Path to the PKCS12 certificate                                                 |
| `sslpassword`      | No       |                        | Password that was used to secure the PKCS12 file                               |
| `sslaccept`        | No       | `accept_invalid_certs` | Configures whether to check for missing values in the certificate              |
| `host`             | No       |                        | Points to a directory that contains a socket to be used for the connection     |

As an example, if you want to connect to a schema called `myschema`, set the connection pool size to `5` and configure a timeout for queries of `3` seconds, you can use the following arguments:

```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=myschema&connection_limit=5&socket_timeout=3
```

### Configuring an SSL connection

You can add various parameters to the connection string if your database server uses SSL. Here's an overview of the possible parameters:

- `sslmode=(disable|prefer|require)`:
  - `prefer` (default): Prefer TLS if possible, accept plain text connections.
  - `disable`: Do not use TLS.
  - `require`: Require TLS or fail if not possible.
- `sslcert=<PATH>`: Path the the server certificate. This is the root certificate used by the database server to sign the client certificate. You need to provide this if the certificate doesn't exist in the trusted certificate store of your system. For Google Cloud this likely is `server-ca.pem`.
- `sslidentity=<PATH>`: Path to the PKCS12 certificate database created from client cert and key. This is the SSL identity file in PKCS12 format which you will generate using the client key and client certificate. It combines these two files in a single file and secures them via a password (see next parameter). You can create this file using your client key and client certificate by using the following command (using `openssl`):
  ```
  openssl pkcs12 -export -out client-identity.p12 -inkey client-key.pem -in client-cert.pem
  ```
- `sslpassword=<PASSWORD>`: Password that was used to secure the PKCS12 file. The `openssl` command listed in the previous step will ask for a password while creating the PKCS12 file, you will need to provide that same exact password here.
- `sslaccept=(strict|accept_invalid_certs)`:
  - `strict`: Any missing value in the certificate will lead to an error. For Google Cloud, especially if the database doesn't have a domain name, the certificate might miss the domain/IP address, causing an error when connecting.
  - `accept_invalid_certs` (default): Bypass this check. Be aware of the security consequences of this setting.

To recap, in order to create a SSL connection to your database, you need:

- A root [CA](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc778623(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN>) file
- A [PKCS12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) client file
- A [PKCS12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) password

Your database connection URL will look similar to this:

```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?sslidentity=client-identity.p12&sslpassword=mypassword&sslcert=rootca.cert
```

### Connecting via sockets

To connect to your PostgreSQL database via sockets, you must add a `host` field as a _query parameter_ to the connection string (instead of setting it as the `host` part of the URI).
The value of this parameter then must point to the directory that contains the socket, e.g.: `postgresql://USER:POST@localhost/database?host=/var/run/postgresql/`

Note that `localhost` is required, the value itself is ignored and can be anything.

## Type mapping between PostgreSQL to Prisma schema

The PostgreSQL connector maps the [scalar types](..//prisma-schema/data-model#scalar-types) from the Prisma [data model](../prisma-schema/data-model) as follows to native column types:

### Prisma Migrate

| Prisma     | PostgreSQL  |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `String`   | `text`      |
| `Boolean`  | `boolean`   |
| `Int`      | `integer`   |
| `Float`    | `real`      |
| `Datetime` | `timestamp` |

### Introspection

When introspecting a PostgreSQL database, the database types are mapped to Prisma according to the following table:

| PostgreSQL                                  | Prisma     | Supported |

During [introspection](../introspection), fields with types that **already have match in the Prisma schema but are not yet supported** will be added to the Prisma schema as comments, e.g. `macaddr` would be added to a model as follows:

```prisma
model Device {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
// This type is currently not supported.
//  mac   String
}
```

Fields with types that **do not yet have match in the Prisma schema (and are not yet supported)** will be also be added as comments to the Prisma schema as comments using the PostgreSQL type, e.g. `macaddr` would be added to a model as follows:

```prisma
model Device {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
// This type is currently not supported.
//  data   xml
}
```
