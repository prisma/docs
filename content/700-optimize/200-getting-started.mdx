## Prerequisites

Before you begin with Prisma Optimize, ensure you have the following:

- A [Prisma Data Platform account](https://console.prisma.io/optimize?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=optimize-page).
- A project using [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) version `5.0.0` or higher (we recommend using the latest version).
- A PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, CockroachDB, or MS SQL Server database.

:::note

Prisma Optimize is intended for use in local environments. Learn more in the [FAQ](/optimize/faq#can-i-use-prisma-optimize-in-production).

:::

## 1. Launch Optimize

1. Log in to your [Prisma Data Platform account](https://console.prisma.io/optimize?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=optimize-page).
2. <a href="/docs/platform/about#accessing-the-optimize-dashboard" target="_blank">Follow the instructions</a> to access and launch Prisma Optimize.

## 2. Add Optimize to your application

### 2.1. Update Your `schema.prisma` file

In the `generator` block of your Prisma schema, add the `tracing` preview feature:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["tracing"]
}
```

Then, generate the Prisma Client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 2.2. Install the Optimize Prisma Client extension

Install the latest versions of Prisma Client and the Optimize extension:

```bash
npm install @prisma/client@latest @prisma/extension-optimize
```

### 2.3. Add the Optimize API Key to your `.env` file

<a href="/docs/platform/about#generating-an-optimize-api-key" target="_blank">Generate a Prisma Optimize API key</a> and add it to your `.env` file:

```bash
OPTIMIZE_API_KEY="YOUR_OPTIMIZE_API_KEY"
```

### 2.4. Extend your Prisma Client instance

Extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Optimize extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { withOptimize } from "@prisma/extension-optimize";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withOptimize({ apiKey: process.env.OPTIMIZE_API_KEY }),
);
```

#### Using the Optimize extension with other extensions or middleware

Since [extensions are applied one after another](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions#conflicts-in-combined-extensions), make sure you apply them in the correct order. Extensions cannot share behavior and the last extension applied takes precedence.

If you are using [Prisma Accelerate](/accelerate) in your application, make sure you apply it _after_ the Optimize extension. For example:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withOptimize()).$extends(withAccelerate())
```

If you are using [Prisma Middleware](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions/middleware) in your application, make sure they are added before any Prisma Client extensions (like Optimize). For example:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$use(middleware).$extends(withOptimize())
```

### 2.5. Use Prisma Optimize to generate insights

Follow these steps to start generating query insights with Prisma Optimize:

1. In the Optimize dashboard, click the **Start recording** button, then run your app and execute some Prisma queries while recording is active.
2. After your app runs and generates insights based on the executed Prisma queries, click the **Stop recording** button.
3. Explore [individual query details](/optimize/recordings#data-captured-in-a-recording-session) by clicking on them, and check the **Recommendations** tab for any suggested improvements to enhance query performance.

   Use [Prisma AI](/optimize/prisma-ai) to understand recommendations and apply them within your Prisma model context.
