## Prerequisites

Before you begin with Prisma Optimize, ensure you have the following:

- A [Prisma Data Platform account](https://console.prisma.io).
- A project using [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) version `5.0.0` or higher (we recommend using the latest version).
- A PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, PlanetScale, CockroachDB, MS SQL Server, or MongoDB database.

## 1. Launch Optimize

1. Log in to your [Prisma Data Platform account](https://console.prisma.io/optimize?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=optimize-page).
2. Access and launch the Optimize dashboard by following the instructions [here](/platform/about#accessing-the-optimize-dashboard).

## 2. Add Optimize to your application

### 2.1. Update Your `schema.prisma` file

In the `generator` block of your Prisma schema, add the `tracing` preview feature:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["tracing"]
}
```

Then, generate the Prisma Client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 2.2. Install the Optimize Prisma Client extension

Install the latest versions of Prisma Client and the Optimize extension:

```bash
npm install @prisma/client@latest @prisma/extension-optimize
```

### 2.3. Add the Optimize API Key to your `.env` file

Generate an Optimize API key by following the instructions [here](/platform/about#generating-an-optimize-api-key) and add it to your `.env` file:

```bash
OPTIMIZE_API_KEY="YOUR_OPTIMIZE_API_KEY"
```

### 2.4. Extend your Prisma Client instance with the Optimize extension

Extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Optimize extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { withOptimize } from "@prisma/extension-optimize";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withOptimize({ token: process.env.OPTIMIZE_API_KEY }),
);
```

### 2.5. Use Prisma Optimize to generate insights

Follow these steps to start generating query insights with Prisma Optimize:

1. In the Optimize dashboard, click the **Start recording** button, then run your app and execute some Prisma queries while recording is active.
2. After your app runs and generates insights based on the executed Prisma queries, click the **Stop recording** button.
3. Explore [individual query details](/optimize/recordings#data-captured-in-a-recording-session) by clicking on them, and check the **Recommendations** tab for any suggested improvements to enhance query performance.
