The following query targeting a `User` model do not provide a [`take` option](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#findmany):

```ts
await prisma.user.findMany({ where: { email: "janedoe@gmail.com" }})
```

## Why is this a problem?

When a query is executed without specifying a limit, it will return all relevant rows, which can lead to several issues:

### User experience

- **Viewing data:** Users typically need only a portion of the data at any given time, not all of it at once.
- **Impact on the user's device:** Displaying all the data at once can strain the user's device resources. For example, loading thousands of rows in a web application can slow down or freeze the browser, consuming significant memory and CPU resources.
- **Waiting time:** Retrieving a large number of rows can significantly increase the time it takes to get the data from the database to the user's device.

### Resource Utilization

- **Unnecessary data load:** Processing more data than required wastes valuable resources.
- **Memory usage:** Excessive memory consumption can lead to inefficiency and, in severe cases, cause the system to run out of memory, disrupting the service.

## Recommendation

To avoid these issues, we recommend using the [`take` option](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#findmany) to limit the number of entries returned by your queries:

```typescript
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  take: 10, // Limits the number of results to 10
  // other query parameters
})
```
:::note

Before applying this recommendation, it is important to verify that your application does not rely on retrieving all results from the query. If your application requires all results, you may need to implement *pagination*. For more details, see the Prisma [Pagination Documentation](/orm/prisma-client/queries/pagination).
