Optimize provides recommendations to help you identify and resolve performance issues caused by full table scans from `LIKE` operations.

The following query targeting the `User` model provides `contains` and `endsWith` as options, which translate to `LIKE` and `ILIKE` SQL operators.

```jsx
await prisma.user.findMany({ 
  where: { 
    email: { contains: "gmail.com" }, 
    name: { endsWith: "Burk" } 
  } 
})
```

## What is the problem?

`LIKE` and `ILIKE` operators in SQL can lead to full table scans, potentially impacting performance, especially with larger datasets:

### UX

- **Slower load times:** Full table scans can significantly increase the time it takes to retrieve data, leading to longer wait times for users.

### Resource utilization

- **Increased resource usage:** Full table scans increase CPU, memory usage, and disk I/O, straining system resources for your database.
- **Increased costs:** In serverless database pricing plans, more intensive resource usage can translate into higher costs.

## Recommendation

To mitigate potential performance issues, consider extracting a separate indexed `String` field for the substring being filtered on, or a `Boolean` field indicating the presence of a given substring. These approaches are particularly useful if you have a limited, known set of substrings.

For example, if you frequently filter on the file extension of a `filePath` field, you can create an indexed column for the file extension:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model File {
  id            Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  filePath      String
  fileExtension String

  @@index([fileExtension])
}
```

This solution has trade-offs, such as increased storage requirements and potential impacts on write performance due to the additional index. Consider whether this approach is beneficial for your use case.
