Optimize provides recommendations to help you identify and resolve performance issues caused by full table scans from `LIKE` operations.

The following query targeting the `User` model provides `contains` and `endsWith` as options, which translate to `LIKE` and `ILIKE` SQL operators.

```jsx
await prisma.user.findMany({ 
  where: { 
    email: { contains: "gmail.com" }, 
    name: { endsWith: "Burk" } 
  } 
})
```

## What is the problem?

`LIKE` and `ILIKE` operators in SQL can lead to full table scans, potentially impacting performance, especially with larger datasets:

### UX

- **Slower load times:** Full table scans can significantly increase the time it takes to retrieve data, leading to longer wait times for users.

### Resource utilization

- **Increased resource usage:** Full table scans increase CPU, memory usage, and disk I/O, straining system resources for your database.
- **Increased costs:** In serverless database pricing plans, more intensive resource usage can translate into higher costs.
