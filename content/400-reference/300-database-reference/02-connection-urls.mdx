Prisma needs a connection URL to be able to connect to your database, e.g. when sending queries with [Prisma Client](../../concepts/components/prisma-client) or when changing the database schema with [Prisma Migrate](../../concepts/components/prisma-migrate).

The connection URL is provided via the `url` field of a `datasource` block in your Prisma schema. It generally consists of the following components (except for SQLite):

- **User**: The name of your database user
- **Password**: The password for your database user
- **Host**: The IP or domain name of the machine where your database server is running
- **Port**: The port on which your database server is running
- **Database name**: The name of the database you want to use

Make sure you have this information at hand when getting started with Prisma. If you don't have a database server running yet, you can either use a local SQLite database file (see the [Quickstart](../../getting-started/quickstart)) or [setup a free PostgreSQL database on Heroku](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1).

## Examples

Here are examples for the connection URLs of the databases Prisma supports:

### PostgreSQL

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb"
}
```

### MySQL

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/mydb"
}
```

### Microsoft SQL Server (Preview)

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlserver"
  url      = "sqlserver://localhost:1433;initial catalog=sample;user=sa;password=mypassword;"
}
```

> **Note**: You must [enable the `microsoftSqlServer` Preview feature](../../concepts/components/preview-features/sql-server#enable-sql-server-preview-feature) in order to use the Microsoft SQL Server connector.

### SQLite

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}
```

### MongoDB (Preview)

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = "mongodb+srv://root:<password>@cluster0.ab1cd.mongodb.net/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
}

generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["mongoDb"]
}
```

## .env

You can also provide the connection URL as an environment variable:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

You can then either set the environment variable in your terminal or by providing a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file named `.env`. This will automatically be picked up by the Prisma CLI.

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb
```

## Format

The format of the connection URL depends on the _database connector_ you're using. Prisma generally supports the standard formats for each database. You can find out more about the connection URL of your database on the dedicated docs page:

- [PostgreSQL](../../../concepts/database-connectors/postgresql)
- [MySQL](../../../concepts/database-connectors/mysql)
- [SQLite](../../../concepts/database-connectors/sqlite)
- [MongoDB](../../../concepts/database-connectors/mongodb)

### Special characters

For MySQL and PostgreSQL, you must percentage-encode special characters in any part of your connection URL - including passwords. For example, `p@$$w0rd` becomes `p%40%24%24w0rd`.
