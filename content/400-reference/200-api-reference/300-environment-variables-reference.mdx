This document describes different environment variables and their use cases.

</TopBlock>

## Prisma Client

### <inlinecode>DEBUG</inlinecode>

`DEBUG` is used to enable debugging output in the Prisma Client.

Example setting Prisma Client level debugging output:

```terminal
# enable only `prisma:client`-level debugging output
export DEBUG="prisma:client"
```

See [Debugging](../../concepts/components/prisma-client/debugging) for more information.

### <inlinecode>NO_COLOR</inlinecode>

`NO_COLOR` if [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) will activate the `colorless` setting for error formatting and strip colors from error messages.

See [Formatting via environment variables](../../concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/error-formatting#formatting-via-environment-variables) for more information.

## Prisma Studio

### <inlinecode>BROWSER</inlinecode>

`BROWSER` is for Prisma Studio to force which browser it should be open in, if not set it will open in the default browser. It's also used as a flag when starting the studio from the CLI.

```js
BROWSER=firefox prisma studio --port 5555
```

```terminal
prisma studio --browser firefox
```

See [Studio](./command-reference/#studio) documentation for more information.

## Prisma CLI

### <inlinecode>PRISMA_HIDE_UPDATE_MESSAGE</inlinecode>

`PRISMA_HIDE_UPDATE_MESSAGE` is used to hide the update notification message that is shown when a newer Prisma CLI version is available. It's a truthy value.

```js
const shouldHide = process.env.PRISMA_HIDE_UPDATE_MESSAGE
```

### <inlinecode>PRISMA_GENERATE_SKIP_AUTOINSTALL</inlinecode>

`PRISMA_GENERATE_SKIP_AUTOINSTALL` can be set to a truthy value to skip the auto-install of `prisma` CLI and `@prisma/client` dependencies (if they are missing), if the `prisma-client-js` generator is defined in the Prisma Schema, when using the `prisma generate` command.

### <inlinecode>PRISMA_DISABLE_WARNINGS</inlinecode>

Disables all CLI warnings generated by `logger.warn`.

## Proxy environment variables

The Prisma CLI supports custom HTTP(S) proxies to download the Prisma engines. These can be helpful to use when working behind a corporate firewall. See [Using a HTTP proxy for the CLI](../../concepts/components/prisma-cli/installation/#using-a-http-proxy-for-the-cli) for more information.

### <inlinecode>NO_PROXY</inlinecode>

`NO_PROXY` is a comma-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses that do not require a proxy.

```terminal
NO_PROXY=myhostname.com,10.11.12.0/16,172.30.0.0/16
```

### <inlinecode>HTTP_PROXY</inlinecode>

`HTTP_PROXY` is set with the hostname or IP address of a proxy server.

```terminal
HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com
```

### <inlinecode>HTTPS_PROXY</inlinecode>

`HTTPS_PROXY` is set with the hostname or IP address of a proxy server.

```terminal
HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com
```

## Binary environment variables

By default all binaries are downloaded when you install Prisma CLI. There are however situations where you may wish to use a custom binary. See [Prisma Engines](../../concepts/components/prisma-engines) for more information.

### <inlinecode>PRISMA_BINARIES_MIRROR</inlinecode>

`PRISMA_BINARIES_MIRROR` can be used to specify a custom CDN (or server) endpoint to download the engines binaries for the CLI/Client. The default value is `https://binaries.prisma.sh`, where Prisma hosts the binaries.

```terminal
PRISMA_BINARIES_MIRROR=https://my-allowed-url
```

See [Prisma engines](../../concepts/components/prisma-engines#hosting-binaries) for a conceptual overview of how to use this environment variable.

### <inlinecode>PRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY</inlinecode>

`PRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY` is used to set a custom location for your own migration engine binary.

```terminal
PRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY=custom/my-migration-engine-unix
```

### <inlinecode>PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY</inlinecode>

`PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` is used to set a custom location for your own query engine binary. 

```terminal
PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY=custom/my-query-engine-unix
```

For Prisma CLI it allows you to define the query engine file to be used.  
For Prisma Client, on build time (during `prisma generate`), it defines where the query engine file will be copied from into the Prisma Client. At run time (when using the generated Client) it can be used to define the specific query engine file to be used instead of the included one.

### <inlinecode>PRISMA_INTROSPECTION_ENGINE_BINARY</inlinecode>

`PRISMA_INTROSPECTION_ENGINE_BINARY` is used to set a custom location for your own introspection engine binary.

```terminal
PRISMA_INTROSPECTION_ENGINE_BINARY=custom/my-introspection-engine-unix
```

### <inlinecode>PRISMA_FMT_BINARY</inlinecode>

`PRISMA_FMT_BINARY` is used to set a custom location for your own format engine binary.

```terminal
PRISMA_FMT_BINARY=custom/my-custom-format-engine-unix
```

### <inlinecode>PRISMA_CLI_BINARY_TARGETS</inlinecode>

`PRISMA_CLI_BINARY_TARGETS` can be used to specify one or more binary targets that the CLI will download, it must be provided during `npm install`.

For example:
If you are on macOS, the binary target is `darwin` & AWS Lambda target is `rhel-openssl-1.0.x`

```terminal
PRISMA_CLI_BINARY_TARGETS=darwin,rhel-openssl-1.0.x npm install
```
