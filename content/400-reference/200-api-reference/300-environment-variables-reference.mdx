## Overview

This document describes different environment variables and their use cases.

### DEBUG

`DEBUG` is used to enable debugging output in the Prisma Client.

Example setting Prisma Client level debugging output:

```terminal
# enable only `prisma-client`-level debugging output
export DEBUG="prisma-client"
```

See [Debugging](../../concepts/components/prisma-client/debugging) for more information.

### NO_COLOR

`NO_COLOR` if [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) will activate the `colorless` setting for error formatting and strip colors from error messages.

See [Formatting via environment variables](../../concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/error-formatting#formatting-via-environment-variables) for more information.

### NO_PROXY

`NO_PROXY` is a comma-seperated list of hostnames, IP addresses or IP ranges that do not require a proxy.

```terminal
NO_PROXY=myhostname.com,10.11.12.0/16,172.30.0.0/16
```

### HTTP_PROXY

`HTTP_PROXY` is set with the hostname or IP address of a proxy server.

```terminal
HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com
```

### HTTPS_PROXY

`HTTPS_PROXY` is set with the hostname or IP address of a proxy server.

```terminal
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com
```

### PRISMA_HIDE_UPDATE_MESSAGE

`PRISMA_HIDE_UPDATE_MESSAGE` is used to when checking if a Prisma update is cached. It's a truthy value.

```js
const shouldHide = process.env.PRISMA_HIDE_UPDATE_MESSAGE
```

### PRISMA_GENERATE_SKIP_AUTOINSTALL

`PRISMA_GENERATE_SKIP_AUTOINSTALL` can be set to a truthy value to skip the auto-install of `prisma` CLI and `@prisma/client` dependencies (if they are missing) when using the `prisma generate` command.

### SKIP_GENERATE

`SKIP_GENERATE` can be set to a truthy value to skip running `prisma generate` on npm's postinstall lifecycle hook.

### BROWSER

`BROWSER` is for Prisma Studio to force which browser it should be open in, if not set it will open in the default browser. It's also used as a flag when starting the studio from the CLI.

```js
BROWSER=firefox prisma studio --port 5555
```

```terminal
prisma studio --browser firefox
```

See [Studio](./command-reference/#studio) documentation for more information.

### PRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY

`PRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY` is used to set a custom location for your own migration engine binary.

```js
PRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY=custom/my-migration-engine-unix
```

### PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY

`PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` is used to set a custom location for your own query engine binary.

### QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY_PATH

When connecting to the database the `QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY_PATH` is used to set a custom path to the binary.

```js
QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY_PATH=custom/my-custom-query-path-unix
```
