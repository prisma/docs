## Overview

This page walks you through the process of setting up Prisma from scratch with your own database. It uses plain SQL to create tables in your database. 

## Prerequisites

In order to successfully complete this guide, you need:

- [Node.js]() installed on your machine
- a [PostgreSQL]() database server running
- the [`psql`]() command line client for PostgreSQL

Make sure your have your database [connection URL]() (includes your authentication credentials) at hand!

If you don't have a database server running and only want to explore Prisma, check out the [Quickstart]().

## Create project setup

As a first step, create a project directory and navigate into it:

```
mkdir hello-prisma
cd hello-prisma
```

Next, initialize a Node.js project add the Prisma CLI as a development dependency in your project:

```
npm init -y
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` with an initial setup for a Node.js app.

You can now invoke the Prisma CLI by prefixing it with `npx`:

```
npx prisma
```

Next, set up your Prisma project by creating your [Prisma schema]() file with the following command:

```
npx prisma init
```

This command created a new directory called `prisma` with the following contents:

- `schema.prisma`: The Prisma schema with your database connection and the Prisma Client generator
- `.env`: A [dotenv]() file for defining environment variables (used for your database connection)

## Connect your database

To connect your database, you need to set the `url` field of the `datasource` block in your Prisma schema to your database [connection URL]():

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

In this case, the `url` is [set via an environment variable]() which is defined in `prisma/.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:johndoe@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
```

You now need to adjust the connection URL to point to your own database. 

The format of the connection URL for your database typically depends on the database you use. For PostgreSQL, it looks as follows (the parts spelled all-uppercased are placeholders for your specific connection details):

```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=SCHEMA
```

Here's a short explanation of each component:

- `USER`: The name of your database user
- `PASSWORD`: The password your database user
- `PORT`: The port where your database server is running (typically `5432` for PostgreSQL)
- `DATABASE`: The name of the [database]()
- `SCHEMA`: The name of the [schema]() inside the database 

If you're unsure what to provide for the `schema` parameter for a PostgreSQL connection URL, you can probably omit it. In that case, the default schema name `public` will be used.

As an example, for a PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku, the [connection string](./core/connectors/postgresql.md#connection-string) might look similar to this:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://opnmyfngbknppm:XXX@ec2-46-137-91-216.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5432/d50rgmkqi2ipus?schema=hello-prisma"
```

When running PostgreSQL locally, your user and password as well as the database name typically correspond to the current _user_ of your OS, e.g. assuming the user is called `janedoe`:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:janedoe@localhost:5432/janedoe?schema=hello-prisma"
```

## Create database tables with SQL

In this guide, you'll use plain SQL to create the tables in your database. Create a new file called `schema.sql` and add the following contents to it:

```sql copy
CREATE TABLE "public"."User" (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE "public"."Post" (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  content TEXT,
  published BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  author INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (author) REFERENCES "public"."User"(id)
);

CREATE TABLE "public"."Profile" (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  bio TEXT,
  "user" INTEGER UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY ("user") REFERENCES "public"."User"(id)
);
```

> **Note**: Some fields are written in double-quotes to ensure PostgreSQL uses proper casing. If no double-quotes are used, PostgreSQL would just read everything as _lowercase_ characters.

You can create the tables using any PostgreSQL client of your choice. If you're using `psql`, you can now create the tables using the following command:

```
psql -h HOST -d DATABASE -U USER -f schema.sql
```

Similar to before, you need to replace the all-uppercase placeholders with your database credentials, e.g.:


<CodeBlock languages={["Unix (Mac OS, Linux)", "Windows"]}>

```bash copy
psql -h localhost -d hello-prisma -U janedoe -f schema.sql
```

```bash copy

\connect DATABASE
\i 'c:/hello-prisma/schema.sql'
```

</CodeBlock>

Great, you now created three tables in your database

</details>

## Introspect your database with Prisma

As a next step, you will introspect your database. The result of the introspection will be a [data model]() inside your Prisma schema.

Run the following command to introspect your database:

```
npx prisma introspect
```

This commands reads the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable that's defined in `.env` and connects to your database. Once the connection is established, it introspects the database (i.e. it _reads the database schema_). It then translates the database schema from SQL into a Prisma data model.

After the introspection has completed, your Prisma schema file was updated:

![](https://imgur.com/EYC3RIK.png)

It now looks as follows (note that the fields on the models have been reordered for better readability):

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  author    User     @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  id   Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  bio  String?
  user User    @relation(references: [id])
}

model User {
  id      Int       @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name    String?
  email   String    @unique
  post    Post[]
  profile Profile?
}
```

Prisma's data model is a declarative representation of your database schema and serves as foundation for the generated Prisma Client library. Your Prisma Client instance will expose queries that are _tailored_ to these models.

Right now, there's one minor "issue" with the data model. The `post` relation field on `User` is slightly misnamed after the introspection, since it's actually a [list]() of posts – a better name therefore would be `posts`. This is relevant for the generated Prisma Client API where using `posts` will feel more natural than `post`.

To make this change, manually rename the `post` field to `posts`:

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int       @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name    String?
  email   String    @unique
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}
```

> **Note**: The `posts` field is [virtual]() so you can rename it in your Prisma schema without using [`@map`](). Learn more about [configuring your Prisma Client API](). 

## Install and generate Prisma Client

To get started with Prisma Client, you need to install it as a node module:

```
npm install @prisma/client
```

Notice that the [`@prisma/client` node module]() is a bit different from "conventional" node modules (e.g. a library like [`lodash`]()). When installing the module with `npm install @prisma/client`, npm only downloads an empty package into the `node_modules/@prisma/client` directory. The package is then "filled" with the actual library with the following command of the Prisma CLI:

```
npx prisma generate
```

This commands reads your Prisma schema and generates your Prisma Client library into `node_modules/@prisma/client`.

![](https://imgur.com/0kmSv6l.png)

Because the `@prisma/client` node module actually is customized to your project, it is sometimes referred to as a "smart node module":

![](https://i.imgur.com/83djlkl.png)

## Write your first query with Prisma Client

Now that you generated your Prisma Client library, you can start writing queries to read and write data in your database. For the purpose of this guide, you'll use a plain Node.js script to explore some basic features of Prisma Client.

Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code to it:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require("@prisma/client")

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  // ... you will write your Prisma Client queries here
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.disconnect()
  })
```

Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet:

1. Import the `PrismaClient` constructor from the `@prisma/client` node module
1. Instantiate `PrismaClient`
1. Define an `async` function called `main` to send queries to the database
1. Call the `main` function
1. Close the database connections when the script terminates

Inside the `main` function, add the folowing query to read all `User` records from the database and print the result:

```js
async function main() {
  const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany()
  console.log(allUsers)
}
```

Now run the code with this command:

```
node index.js
```

This should print an empty arrays because there are not `User` records in the databse yet:

```js
[]
```

## Write data into the database

The `findMany` query you used in the previous section only _reads_ data from the database (although it was still empty). In this section, you'll learn how to write a query to _write_ new records into the `Post` and `User` tables.

Adjust the `main` function to send a `create` query to the database:

```js
async function main() {

  await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: "Alice",
      email: "alice@prisma.io",
      author: {
        create: { title: "Hello World" },
      },
      profile: {
        create: { bio:  "I like turtles" }
      }
    }
  })

  const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
    include: { 
      posts: true,
      profile: true 
    },
  })
  console.dir(allUsers, { depth: null })
}
```

This code creates a new `User` record together with new `Post` and `Profile` records using a [nested write]() query. The `User` record is connected to the two other ones via the `Post.author` ↔ `User.posts` and `Profile.user` ↔ `User.profile` [relation fields]() respectively.

Notice that you're passing the [`include`]() option to `findMany` which tells Prisma Client to include the `posts` and `profile` relations on the returned `User` objects.

Run the code with this command:

```
node index.js
```

The output should look similar to this:

```js
[
  {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    id: 1,
    name: 'Alice',
    posts: [
      {
        content: null,
        createdAt: 2020-03-21T16:45:01.246Z,
        id: 1,
        published: false,
        title: 'Hello World'
      }
    ],
    profile: {
      bio: 'I like turtles'
    }
  }
]
```

The query added new records to the `User` and the `Post` tables:

**User**

| **id** | **email**           | **name**  |
| :----- | :------------------ | :-------- |
| `1`    | `"alice@prisma.io"` | `"Alice"` |

**Post**

| **id** | **createdAt**              | **title**       | **content** | **published** | **author** |
| :----- | :------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------- | :------------ | :--------- |
| `1`    | `2020-03-21T16:45:01.246Z` | `"Hello World"` | `null`      | `false`       | `1`        |

**Profile**

| **id** | **bio**           | **user**  |
| :----- | :------------------ | :-------- |
| `1`    | `"I like turtles"` | `1` |

> **Note**: The numbers in the `author` column on `Post` and `user` column on `Profile` reference the `id` column of the `User` table: the `id` value `1` column therefore refers to the first (and only) `User` record in the database.

Before moving on to the next section, you'll "publish" the `Post` record you just created using an `update` query. Adjust the `main` function as follows:

```js
async function main() {
  const post = await prisma.post.update({
    where: { id: 1 },
    data: { published: true },
  })
  console.log(post)
}
```

Now run the code using the same command as before:

```
node index.js
```

You will see the following output:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  title: 'Hello World',
  content: null,
  published: true
}
```

The `Post` record with an `id` of `1` now got updated in the database:

**Post**

| **id** | **title**                       | **content** | **published** | **author** |
| :----- | :------------------------------ | :---------- | :------------ | :--------- |
| `1`    | `"Hello World"`                 | `null`      | `true`        | `1`        |

Fantastic, you just wrote new data into your database for the first time using Prisma Client 🚀


## Next steps

### Continue exploring the Prisma Client API

You can send a variety of different queries with the Prisma Client API. Check out the [API reference]() and use your existing PostgreSQL-based setup from this guide to try them out.

**Tip**: You can use your editor's auto-completion feature to learn about the different API calls and the arguments it takes. Auto-completion is commonly invoked by hitting <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SPACE</kbd> on your keyboard.

<details><summary>Expand for more Prisma Client API examples</summary>

Here are a few suggestions for a number of more queries you can send with Prisma Client:

**Filter all `Post` records that contain `"hello"`**

```js
const filteredPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { title: { contains: "hello" },
      { content: { contains: "hello" },
    ],
  },
})
```

**Create a new `Post` record and connect it to an existing `User` record**

```js
const post = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: "Join us for Prisma Day 2020",
    posts: {
      connect: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
    },
  },
})
```

**Use the fluent relations API to retrieve the `Post` records of a `User` by traversing the relations**

```js
const posts = await prisma.profile
  .findOne({
    where: { id: 1 },
  })
  .user()
  .posts()
```

**Delete a `User` record**

```js
const deletedUser = await prisma.user.delete({
  where: { email: "sarah@prisma.io" },
})
```

</details>

### Explore the data in Prisma Studio (experimental)

Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database. You can use it by running the following command:

```
npx prisma studio --experimental
```

### Change the database schema (e.g. add more tables)

To evolve the app, you need to follow the same flow of the tutorial:

1. Manually adjust your database schema using SQL
1. Re-introspect your database
1. Re-generate Prisma Client
