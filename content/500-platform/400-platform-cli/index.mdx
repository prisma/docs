Welcome to the documentation for accessing the [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) via the [Prisma CLI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli).

This integration, currently in Early Access, extends the functionality of the Prisma CLI, enabling you to manage your Platform projects with Prisma Accelerate directly from the CLI.
