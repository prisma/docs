Workspaces provide a unified space for team collaboration on projects. Manage membership and billing directly within each Workspace.

## Billing

For your Workspace, you can choose a subscription plan that aligns closely with your requirements. Every project within a Workspace adds to the collective usage, ensuring a holistic view of consumption.

All our paid plans are prorated, which means you're only billed for the duration you use a specific plan. For example, if you subscribe to our **Pro** plan for only 15 days in a 30-day month, you'll only be charged for half of the plan's price. Visit our [pricing page](https://www.prisma.io/pricing) for more details.
