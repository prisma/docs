To use the Data Proxy for a JavaScript/TypeScript application that uses Prisma, you must first create a project in Prisma Data Platform. When you create the project, you do the following:

- select a Data Proxy region for the project (make sure that it is close to your database)
- create a Data Proxy connection string

<Admonition>

**Note**<br /><br />

When you create your project, you do not need to also create a Data Proxy connection string. You can always create a new Data Proxy connection string at a later time as described below in [Enable Data Proxy for a project](#enable-the-data-proxy-for-a-project).

</Admonition>

You can then configure the connection string in your development or deployment environment and [configure Prisma project to use Data Proxy](#configure-prisma-project-to-use-data-proxy).

</TopBlock>

## Enable the Data Proxy for a project

When you create a project in the platform, the Data Proxy is automatically enabled for your project.

<Admonition>

**Note**<br /><br />

The fact that the Data Proxy is enabled for a project does not yet mean that your application starts to use the proxy.<br /><br />

Your application starts to use the proxy only after you configure a generated Data Proxy connection string as an environment variable for your project so that Prisma Client uses the proxy connection string and not the direct connection to the database.

</Admonition>

### Prerequisites

- Create a project to add your application in the platform. During the process, select a geographic location for the Data Proxy that is closest to the location of your database.
- If your database is behind a firewall, enable static IP addresses for your project and add the IP addresses for the selected Data Proxy region to the allowlist of your database.
  - US East 1 (West Virginia)
    - 54.204.197.119
    - 3.222.148.224
    - 54.204.47.202
    - 3.227.136.248
  - EU Central 1 (Frankfurt, Germany)
    - 35.157.74.165
    - 18.194.25.248
    - 18.184.112.103
    - 18.157.219.25

### Steps

1. Open your project in the Prisma Data Platform. You can do so from the [**Projects**](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page.
2. Get a Data Proxy connection string for the selected environment.

   1. With the project open and an environment selected, click the **Data Proxy** tab.
   2. Click **Create a connection string**.

      <Admonition type="info">

      **Note**<br /><br />

      You can generate as many Data Proxy connection strings as you need. You can later revoke any of the connection strings that you no longer need.

      </Admonition>

   3. Enter a name for the new Data Proxy connection string and click **Create**.

        alt="Prisma Data Platform - Data Proxy - Create and name a new Data Proxy connection string"
        width="450px"
      />

   4. Copy the `prisma://` connection string.

      <Admonition type="warning">

      **Important**<br /><br />

      Save the `prisma://` connection string securely. After you navigate to another page, you cannot retrieve the connection string again from the **Data Proxy**. You can only generate a new connection string, if necessary.

      />

## Configure Prisma project to use Data Proxy

After you create your project in the platform and enable the Data Proxy, you can generate Prisma Client for the Data Proxy and use it with the `prisma://` connection string you obtained.

You can generate and use Prisma Client for the Data Proxy in the following environments:

- In your local development environment, to test the process.
- In your deployment platform. You must replace the direct database connection string with the Data Proxy connection string and make sure that Prisma Client is auto-generated with the `--data-proxy` flag as described below.

### Prerequisites

- [Enable Data Proxy for your project](#enable-the-data-proxy-for-a-project).
- Copy the Data Proxy connection string. Do so for the project environment for which you want to generate Prisma Client.

### Steps

1. In your local development environment, replace the direct database connection string with the Data Proxy `prisma://` connection string.

   ```bash file=.env highlight=1;delete|2;add
   - DATABASE_URL="postgresql://****:****@****"
   + DATABASE_URL="prisma://****:****@****"
   ```

   <Admonition>

   **Note**<br /><br />
   For security reasons, use environment variables for database connection strings and Data Proxy strings. Do not hard-code them into `schema.prisma`. For more information, see [Using `.env` files](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables/env-files).

   </Admonition>

1. To introspect your database or perform migrations using the Prisma CLI, a direct database connection is required. If you are using Prisma version 4.1.0 or later, include the `directUrl` property in the [`datasource`](/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) block of your Prisma schema.

   ```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=8;add
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }
   
   datasource db {
     provider  = "postgresql"
     url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
     directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
   }
   ```

   Then, add the direct database connection string in the `.env` file.

   ```bash file=.env highlight=2;add
   DATABASE_URL="prisma://****:****@****"
   +DIRECT_URL="postgresql://****:****@****"
   ```

   However, in older versions, you need to overwrite the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with the direct database connection string when running migrations. Refer to the Prisma CLI commands with the Data Proxy documentation for more information.

1. Install `prisma` and `@prisma/client`.<br /><br />
   Make sure to use version 3.15.2 or later.<br />

   ```terminal
   npm install prisma@latest --save-dev
   npm install @prisma/client@latest --save
   ```

1. Generate Prisma Client with the `--data-proxy` option.

   ```terminal
   npx prisma generate --data-proxy
   ```

   The generated Prisma Client is a lightweight version because it excludes the local [query engine](/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines) files. The Data Proxy handles the query engine logic.

1. Instantiate Prisma Client in your application code.

   - To use the Data Proxy with Node.js, instantiate `@prisma/client`. [Learn more](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client).

     <TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="TypeScript" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="JavaScript" icon="code"/>]}>

     <tab>

     ```ts
     import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
     const prisma = new PrismaClient()
     // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
     ```

       </tab>

       <tab>

     ```js
     const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/clientj')
     const prisma = new PrismaClient()
     // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
     ```

     </tab>

     </TabbedContent>

   - To use the Data Proxy in Edge runtimes, such as Cloudflare Workers or Vercel Edge Functions, instantiate `@prisma/client/edge`.

     <Admonition>

     **Note**<br /><br />

     You can use `@prisma/client/edge` only with the Data Proxy. In such cases, make sure to use the `--data-proxy` flag or the `PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY=true` environment variable when you [generate Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client).

     </Admonition>

     <TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="TypeScript" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="JavaScript" icon="code"/>]}>

     <tab>

     ```ts
     import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge'
     const prisma = new PrismaClient()
     // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
     ```

     </tab>

     <tab>

     ```js
     const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client/edge')
     const prisma = new PrismaClient()
     // use `prisma` in your application to read and write data in your DB
     ```

     </tab>

     </TabbedContent>

### Result

Your application now uses the Data Proxy.

The generated Prisma Client has a reduced bundle size because the entire query engine logic is now hosted with the Data Proxy.

## Manage the number of database connections

You can set the maximum number of database connections per Data Proxy instance via the `connection_limit` argument in the database connection connection string that's provided to the PDP project via the PDP web UI.

The _default_ value for the `connection_limit` in each Data Proxy instance is `5`. This default value is determined using the calculation `num_physical_cpus * 2 + 1`. The machines Data Proxy is running on have two CPUs, so: `2 * 2 + 1 = 5`.

Here is a sample connection string for the Data Proxy connection that uses the `connection_limit` argument:

```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB?connection_limit=10
```

In the example connection string, the connection limit of `10` is used as a sample value. To ensure that your database's connections are not exhausted, it is recommended to set an appropriate value for the connection limit. This will help manage the surge in traffic effectively and prevent any connection-related issues.

It's important to understand that this connection limit applies to each individual QE instance. For example, if the `connection_limit` is set to `10` and `5` Query Engine (QE) instances are created, a total of `50` connections would be established with the database (`connection_limit * QE instances`). It is important to ensure that the database has sufficient capacity to handle this load of `50` connections.

For more detailed information regarding the limits of the Data Proxy and its concurrency limits, we recommend referring to the Concurrency Limits documentation.
