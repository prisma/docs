## Deploy to Vercel Serverless Functions

To start using the Data Proxy, you only need minimal changes to an existing project that is based on Prisma Client with [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions#serverless-functions).

Our Vercel Deployment sample repository has a [special branch](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-vercel/tree/data-proxy) that shows how to deploy a Prisma application to Vercel Serverless Functions with the Data Proxy.
[Use this link to create a Vercel project based on this branch](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fprisma%2Fdeployment-example-vercel%2Ftree%2Fdata-proxy&env=DATABASE_URL,MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL,PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY&envDescription=DATABASE_URL%20-%20Data%20Proxy%20URL%2C%20MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL%20-%20direct%20connection%20string%2C%20PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY%20-%20always%20set%20to%20true%20so%20Vercel%20generates%20a%20Data%20Proxy%20Client&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prisma.io%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdata-platform%2Fdata-proxy%23using-the-data-proxy-in-a-prisma-application). The link makes sure that you set the correct environment variables to get a Prisma Client for Data Proxy and run migrations when you configure Data Proxy.

If you want to adapt your project manually:

- Add the environment variable `PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY` to your [Vercel project settings](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) and set its value to `true`.
- If you want to deploy migrations to your project in Vercel, follow our instructions on how to use Prisma CLI with the Data Proxy.
