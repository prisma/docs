For any project in the Prisma Data Platform, you can create multiple environments. You can associate each environment with a different database, Data Proxy location, and a different branch of your GitHub repository (if schema synchronization from GitHub is enabled).

## About environments in the Prisma Data Platform

You can dedicate each environment to a different stage of your database application life-cycle, such as production, staging, development, or any others that make sense for your project.

For each new environment in a [project](/platform/classic-projects), you define:

- A database connection string
- A Data Proxy region
- (if schema synchronization is enabled) a GitHub branch from the same repository as the Production environment

## Default environment of a project

When you first create a project, the platform defines the default environment of the project. The default environment has the name **Production**.

When you or your team members open the project, you always start on the default **Production** environment. You can see the name of your current environment in the **Environments** drop-down menu in the upper left.

Until you add another environment and switch to that, the activity that you and your team members carry out in **Data Browser**, **Query Console**, and **Schema Viewer** occurs in the **Production** environment.

- When you manipulate data in **Data Browser** or run queries in **Query Console**, you do so on the database and the Data Proxy region that are defined in the **Production** environment.
- When you view the Prisma schema in **Schema Viewer**, you do so for the Prisma schema file from the GitHub repository and branch defined in the **Production environment**.

After you add more environments, you can switch to another environment from the **Environments** drop-down menu.
