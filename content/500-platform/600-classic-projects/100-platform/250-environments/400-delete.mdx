If you no longer need an [environment](/platform/classic-projects/platform/environments) in your project or want to reduce the number of environments to the quota in the Scale plan, you can delete one of the project environments.

<Admonition type="alert">

**Important**<br /><br />

You cannot delete the default environment. To delete the current default environment, you must first [make one of the other environments the default](/platform/classic-projects/platform/environments/edit-settings/change-default-environment).
