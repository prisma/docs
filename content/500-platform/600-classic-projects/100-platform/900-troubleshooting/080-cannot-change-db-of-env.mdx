metaTitle: 'Cannot change the database of an environment'
metaDescription: 'If you need to update an environment in Prisma Data Platform to use another database, you cannot do so. As a workaround, you can create a new environment and configure a new database for it.'

## Problem

When you create an environment, you set a database connection string and select a Data Proxy region for it. After the platform creates the environment, you cannot change the database of the environment or the Data Proxy region.

## Solution

If you need to use a new database for a project, you can [create a new environment](/platform/classic-projects/platform/environments/create) and configure the new database for it as well as select a different Data Proxy region.
