If you no longer need a project in the Prisma Data Platform, you can delete it from the project settings.

</TopBlock>

## Prerequisites and considerations

- You must be the [owner](/platform/classic-projects/platform/members/roles-permissions) of the project.
- You can delete any project that is on the Free plan.
- To delete a project on the Scale plan, you must first downgrade it to the Free plan.

## Steps

1. In the upper left, click your project name and select **Project settings**.
   <img
     src="../../images/common/open-project-settings.png"
     alt="Prisma Data Platform - Delete project - Open project settings"
     width="350px"
   />
2. On the **Settings** tab, click **Delete Project**.
3. Click **Delete** in the confirmation box.

## Result

The project is deleted from the Prisma Data Platform. The database and repository associated with the project are not affected by the deletion.
