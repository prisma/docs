A _project_ in the Prisma Data Platform is an organizational unit for your JavaScript/TypeScript application that uses Prisma ORM.

You use projects to manage:

- environments
  - your linked GitHub repository and branch
  - your database connection string
  - your Data Proxy region
- members
- paid plan and billing

In the Prisma Data Platform, to create projects, you only need to provide the connection string for your database. You can also select a Data Proxy region for the project, and if necessary, you can configure database access from the supported [static IPs](/platform/classic-projects/platform/static-ips) of the platform.

For each project, you can edit the project name and URL handle, and when you no longer need a project, you can delete it.

- Edit project settings
- Delete a project

You can view all of your existing projects on the [**Projects**](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page. Projects are grouped in the list based on their plan in the following order:

1. Scale
2. Free

Within each group, project names are sorted in alphabetical order.
