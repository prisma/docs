In the era of AI, where code is increasingly written by agents, ensuring clarity, type safety, and reliable infrastructure is essential. With 5+ years of leadership in the TypeScript ecosystem, Prisma ORM and Prisma Postgres provide the proven foundation for AI-assisted development.

### Get started

Run the following command to bootstrap your database with a prompt:

```tsx
npx prisma init --prompt "Create a habit tracker application"
```

### AI coding tools

Prisma ORM and Prisma Postgres integrate seamlessly with your AI coding tools. Check out our documentation with tips and tricks for working with Prisma in various AI editors.
