## Change data capture

[Change data capture (CDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) refers to the process of identifying and capturing changes made to data in a database and then delivering those changes in real-time to a downstream process or system.

## Logical replication

Logical replication is a method of replicating data objects and their changes based on their replication identity (usually a primary key). You can read more about logical replication and how it pertains to your database in Postgres' documentation [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).

1. Create a logical replication slot:

   ```sql
   SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('$REPLICATION_SLOT_NAME', 'pgoutput');
   ```

   Learn more [here](https://pgpedia.info/p/pg_create_logical_replication_slot.html).

2. View your logical replication slots:

   ```sql
   SELECT slot_name, slot_type FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_type = 'logical';
   ```

## Write-ahead log

A [write-ahead log (WAL)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html) is a standard way of ensuring data integrity by only allowing updates to the data in a database _after_ a log has been written to permanent storage describing the change to take place.

This enhances data integrity because all changes to a database are recorded in these log files. In the event of a database crash, the database is recoverable using those logs and can even be recovered to a specific point in time.
