## Enable static IP for Pulse

You can opt-in to use static IP for Pulse when enabling it for a project environment:

1. Insert the database connection string and the closest region to the database.
2. Toggle the **Static IP** switch in the **Network restrictions** section. This will provide you with a list of static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
    Example IPv4 address range:
      ```
      52.86.207.46/32
      100.29.164.162/32
      54.211.230.107/32
      18.235.169.169/32
      54.209.237.70/32
      44.221.111.173/32
      ```
    Example IPv6 address range:
      ```
      2600:1f18:51ce:b00::/64
      2600:1f18:5acb:9a00::/56
      ```
3. Once you have these addresses, configure your database firewall to allow incoming connections only from these IPs and any other trusted IPs that need access to your database.
4. Click on the **Enable Pulse** button.
