<TopBlock>

The Pulse API reference documentation is based on the following schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String?
  email String  @unique
}
```

All example are based on the `User` model.

## `subscribe`

`subscribe` returns all data change events related to the table you call this method on:

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe()
```

### Remarks

Passing an empty object to the `subscribe` function will also behaves the same as passing no argument to the function:

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({})
```

### Database event filters

Inside of the `subscribe()` method you can use filters to get specific events and data. The three filter options currently supported are described below:

#### `create`

You can use the `create` filter to retrieve all _create_ events on a table. A create event is triggered when a new record is created in a table.

Pulse returns the values of the new record as an object named `created`. This represents the state of the record _after_ the create event.

##### Example

<CodeWithResult outputResultText="event">
<cmd>

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  create: {},
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```ts no-copy
{
  action: 'create',
  created: {
    id: 1,
    email: 'marc@prisma.io',
    name: 'Marc'
  }
}
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

#### `update`

You can use the `update` filter to retrieve all _update_ events on a table. An update event is triggered when a value in a database record has changed.

Pulse returns the values of the changed record as an object named `after`. This represents the state of the record _after_ the change event.

##### Example

<CodeWithResult outputResultText="event">
<cmd>

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  update: {},
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```ts no-copy
{
  action: 'update',
  after: {
    id: 1,
    email: 'updated@prisma.io',
    name: 'Marc'
  }
}
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

#### `delete`

You can use the `delete` filter to retrieve all _delete_ events on a table. A delete event is triggered when a record has been removed from the database.

Pulse returns the values of the changed record as an object named `deleted`. This represents the state of the record _before_ the change event.

##### Example

<CodeWithResult outputResultText="event">
<cmd>

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  delete: {},
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```ts no-copy
{
  action: 'delete',
  deleted: {
    id: 1,
    email: '',
    name: null
  }
}
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

<Admonition type="warning">

By default, the response for `delete` events will only return the primary key of the record. To get the _before_ values of all fields in the record, you must set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` on the table(s) you want to get field values for. If this is not configured, defining a filter for deletes will only be possible on the primary key. <br/><br/>
For example, running the following SQL command will set the `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` on a table named `User`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public."User" REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

</Admonition>

## `stop`

Allows you to explicitly stop subscriptions and close the connection. This is needed to ensure that the limited number of subscriptions allowed per table is not exhausted.

```ts
async function main() {
  // Subscribe to new events on the `user` table
  const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({})

  // Set a timeout to the subscription after 60 seconds.
  // Explicitly stopping the subscriptions and closing the connection is needed
  // to not exhaust the limited number of subscriptions allowed per table.

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Stopping the subscription.')
    subscription.stop()
  }, 60000)

  // Waiting loop that prints new events when something changes in the database
  for await (const event of subscription) {
    console.log('new event:', event) // 'create', 'update', 'delete'
  }
}

main()
```

### Filter conditions and operators

Pulse allows you to subscribe to change events based on filter conditions and operators. Pulse supports all of Prisma Client’s [supported filter conditions and operators](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#filter-conditions-and-operators) except for `search` and `mode`. You also won't be able to define filters that reference other models via relations.

You may have to wrap your filter criteria inside a `after` object depending on the type of event your subscription is listening for:

- `after`: `update` events

This makes it explicit that the specified filter criteria apply to the `after` state of the change event.

<Admonition type="info">

All [`create`](#create) event results implicitly represent the `after` state of the change event. And all [`delete`](#delete) event results implicitly represent the `before` state of the change event.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">

In the future, Pulse may support the ability to return both the `before` and `after` state of `update` change events and filter on either state. If these are features you’re interested in, please let us know by sharing your thoughts on our [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord).

</Admonition>

#### Usage in the after state filter

Using a filter inside of `after` will return changed records that match your filter criteria as applied to the state of the record after the change event.

##### Examples

Get `update` events where the value of name is equal to `Jim` after the event has occurred:

<CodeWithResult outputResultText="event">
<cmd>

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  update: {
    after: {
      name: 'Jim',
    },
  },
})
```

</cmd>
<cmdResult>

```ts no-copy
{
  action: 'update',
  after: {
    id: 6,
    email: 'updated@test.com',
    name: 'Jim',
  }
}
```

</cmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>
