The Pulse API reference documentation on this page is based on the following schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String?
  email String  @unique
}
```

## `stream()`

`stream()` returns an [async iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_async_iterator_and_async_iterable_protocols) that receives all database change events related to the table you call this method on.

```ts
const stream = await prisma.user.stream();
```

Because an async iterable is returned, you can use a [`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) loop to wait for and receive events:

```ts
for await (let event of subscription) {
  console.log(event);
}
```

### Notes

- Usage of `stream()` requires [event persistence](/pulse/database-events#event-persistence) to be enabled in your Pulse project.
- `stream()` guarantees that all events will be delivered at least once and in the right order.

### Options

You can pass an object with configuration options to `stream()`. The object has the following fields:

| Name     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`   | The name of the stream. Providing this option enables "resumability" and will make sure you receive events later if your stream isn't active at the time when the event actually happened (e.g. because your server was down).                                                                                            |
| `create` | An object to specify filters for the create events to be received. If you leave the object empty with `create: {}`, you will receive _all_ create events. You can filter on any scalar field of your model.                                                                                                               |
| `update` | An object with an `after` field to specify filters for the update events to be received. If you leave the object empty with `update: {}`, you will receive _all_ update events. The filter is applied to the values of the record _after_ an update has been performed. You can filter on any scalar field of your model. |
| `delete` | An object to specify filters for the delete events to be received. You can filter on any scalar field of your model.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Return type

When called with no filter arguments, the `stream()` method returns the following type:

<TabbedContent code>
<TabItem value="Type">

```ts
PulseSubscription<
  | PulseCreateEvent<{
      id: number;
      name: string | null;
      email: string;
    }>
  | PulseUpdateEvent<{
      id: number;
      name: string | null;
      email: string;
    }>
  | PulseDeleteEvent<{
      id: number;
      name: string | null;
      email: string;
    }>
>;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="No filter arguments">
```ts
const stream = await prisma.user.stream()
```

</TabItem>
</TabbedContent>

Depending on the arguments you provide, the return type may change. For example, if you filter for only `create` events, the type will get adjusted:

<TabbedContent code>
<TabItem value="Type">

```ts
PulseSubscription<
  PulseCreateEvent<{
    id: number;
    email: string;
    name: string | null;
  }>
>;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Filter for `create` events">
```ts
const stream = await prisma.user.stream({
  create: {}
})
```

</TabItem>
</TabbedContent>

### Examples

#### Use a `name` to be able to "resume" the stream

```ts
const stream = await prisma.user.stream({
  name: "all-user-events",
});
```

Learn more about resuming streams [here](/pulse/database-events#resuming-event-streams)

#### Filter for new `User` records with a non-null value for `name`

```ts
const stream = await prisma.user.stream({
  create: {
    name: { not: null },
  },
});
```

#### Filter for updated `User` records where the `email` ends with `@prisma.io` after the update

```ts
const stream = await prisma.user.stream({
  update: {
    after: {
      email: { endsWith: "@prisma.io" },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Filter for deleted `User` records where the `email` contains `hello`

```ts
const stream = await prisma.user.stream({
  delete: {
    email: { contains: "hello" },
  },
});
```

## `subscribe()`

`subscribe()` returns an [async iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_async_iterator_and_async_iterable_protocols) that receives all database change events related to the table you call this method on.

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe();
```

Because an async iterable is returned, you can use a [`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) loop to wait for and receive events:

```ts
for await (let event of subscription) {
  console.log(event);
}
```

### Notes

- `subscribe()` guarantees that all events will be delivered at most once. There are no guarantees about the order in which the events arrive.
- Events delivered with `subscribe()` are _ephemeral_, meaning they won't be delivered if your subscription isn't active during the time when the event happens in the database (e.g. because your server is down).

### Options

You can pass an object with configuration options to `subscribe()`. The object has the following fields:

| Name     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `create` | An object to specify filters for the create events to be received. If you leave the object empty with `create: {}`, you will receive _all_ create events. You can filter on any scalar field of your model.                                                                                                               |
| `update` | An object with an `after` field to specify filters for the update events to be received. If you leave the object empty with `update: {}`, you will receive _all_ update events. The filter is applied to the values of the record _after_ an update has been performed. You can filter on any scalar field of your model. |
| `delete` | An object to specify filters for the delete events to be received. You can filter on any scalar field of your model.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Return type

When called with no filter arguments, the `subscribe()` method returns the following type:

<TabbedContent code>
<TabItem value="Type">

```ts
PulseSubscription<
  | PulseCreateEvent<{
      id: number;
      name: string | null;
      email: string;
    }>
  | PulseUpdateEvent<{
      id: number;
      name: string | null;
      email: string;
    }>
  | PulseDeleteEvent<{
      id: number;
      name: string | null;
      email: string;
    }>
>;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="No filter arguments">
```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe()
```

</TabItem>
</TabbedContent>

Depending on the arguments you provide, the return type may change. For example, if you filter for only `create` events, the type will get adjusted:

<TabbedContent code>
<TabItem value="Type">

```ts
PulseSubscription<
  PulseCreateEvent<{
    id: number;
    email: string;
    name: string | null;
  }>
>;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Filter for `create` events">
```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  create: {}
})
```

</TabItem>
</TabbedContent>

### Examples

#### Filter for new `User` records with a non-null value for `name`

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  create: {
    name: { not: null },
  },
});
```

#### Filter for updated `User` records where the `email` ends with `@prisma.io` after the update

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  update: {
    after: {
      email: { endsWith: "@prisma.io" },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Filter for deleted `User` records where the `email` contains `hello`

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  delete: {
    email: { contains: "hello" },
  },
});
```

## `stream()` vs `subscribe()`

For the majority of use cases, `stream()` is the recommended option because it can provide guarantees for events to arrive on the consumer-side. Note though that because `stream()` requires event persistence to be enabled, this has implications for [event storage and costs](https://www.prisma.io/pricing).

See a [more detailed comparison](/pulse/database-events#event-delivery-semantics-in-prisma-pulse).

## `stop()`

Allows you to explicitly stop streams and subscriptions and close the connection. This is needed to ensure that the limited number of subscriptions allowed per table is not exhausted.

### For `stream()`

```ts
// Create the stream
const stream = await prisma.user.stream();

// ... Use the stream

// Stop the stream
// highlight-next-line
stream.stop();
```

### For `subscribe()`

```ts
// Create the subscription
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe();

// ... Use the subscription

// Stop the subscription
// highlight-next-line
subscription.stop();
```

## `PulseCreateEvent<User>`

An object of type `PulseCreateEvent` is returned by any `create` event that happens in the database.

### Type

A `PulseCreateEvent` has the following fields:

| Name        | Type     | Example value                       | Description                                                                                                           |
| :---------- | :------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`        | `string` | `01HYBEER1JPSBVPG2NQADNQTA6`        | A unique identifier / idempotency key following the [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec#specification) specification. |
| `modelName` | `string` | `User`                              | The name of the model affected by this event. This is a model name from your Prisma schema.                           |
| `action`    | `string` | `create`                            | The kind of write-operation performed in the database: `create`                                                       |
| `created`   | `User`   | See `created` in the example below. | An object with the values of the record was just created.                                                             |

The type of the event is generic to the fields of your model. In the case, of the `User` model above, it looks as follows:

```ts
PulseCreateEvent<{
  id: number;
  email: string;
  name: string | null;
}>;
```

### Example

Here is an example:

```js
{
  action: 'create',
  created: { id: 3, email: 'jane@prisma.io', name: 'Jane Doe' },
  id: '0/2A5A590',
  modelName: 'User'
}
```

## `PulseUpdateEvent<User>`

An object of type `PulseUpdateEvent` is returned by any `delete` event that happens in the database.

### Type

A `PulseUpdateEvent` has the following fields:

| Name        | Type     | Example value                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`        | `string` | `01HYBEER1JPSBVPG2NQADNQTA6`      | A unique identifier / idempotency key following the [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec#specification) specification.                                                                               |
| `modelName` | `string` | `User`                            | The name of the model affected by this event. This is a model name from your Prisma schema.                                                                                                         |
| `action`    | `string` | `update`                          | The kind of write-operation performed in the database: `update`                                                                                                                                     |
| `before`    | `User`   | `null`                            | An object with the _old_ values of the record that was just updated. This only works with when the [`REPLICA IDENTITY`](/pulse/database-setup/general-database-instructions#replica-identity) in your database is set to `FULL`. Otherwise the value will always be `null`. |
| `after`     | `User`   | See `after` in the example below. | An object with the _new_ values of the record that was just updated.                                                                                                                                |

The type of the event is generic to the fields of your model. In the case, of the `User` model above, it looks as follows:

```ts
PulseUpdateEvent<{
  id: number;
  email: string;
  name: string | null;
}>;
```

### Example

_Without_ having set the `REPLICA IDENDITY` to `FULL`:

```js
{
  action: 'update',
  after: { id: 2, email: 'doe@prisma.io', name: 'Jane Doe' },
  before: null,
  id: '0/2A5A248',
  modelName: 'User'
}
```

_With_ having set the `REPLICA IDENDITY` to `FULL`:

```js
{
  action: 'update',
  after: { id: 2, email: 'support@prisma.io', name: 'Jane Doe' },
  before: { id: 2, email: 'support@prisma.io', name: null },
  id: '0/2A5A248',
  modelName: 'User'
}
```

## `PulseDeleteEvent<User>`
