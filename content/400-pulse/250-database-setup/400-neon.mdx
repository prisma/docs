This section provides step-by-step instructions to make a [Neon](https://neon.tech/) database compatible with Prisma Pulse.

## 1. Enable logical replication on Neon

To enable logical replication on Neon, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/).
2. In your project dashboard, go to the **Settings** section from the left panel.
3. Navigate to the **Logical Replication** tab in the **Settings** section.
4. Click the **Enable** button to enable logical replication.

You have successfully enabled Logical replication for Neon. Now, follow the steps below to configure your Neon database to work with Pulse.

## 2. Create publications in Neon

After enabling logical replication on Neon, follow these steps: 

1. Create a publication to track database change events in your Neon database. Open the **SQL Editor** from the left panel of your project dashboard in Neon, and run the following SQL query to create a publication that listens to events from all tables:

   ```sql
   -- Replace $PUBLICATION_NAME with a custom name for your publication
   CREATE PUBLICATION $PUBLICATION_NAME FOR ALL TABLES;
   ```
   <br/>
   :::warning
   To manage your own publication slot while enabling Prisma Pulse, you'll need to be on one of our paid plans. Since managing your own publication slot is required when using Neon, upgrading to a paid plan will allow you to seamlessly use Pulse with Neon. For more information, please visit our [pricing page](https://www.prisma.io/pricing#pulse).
   :::
   :::info
   You can also create a publication to subscribe to database events from *specific tables*. For more details on managing publications, refer to [this section](/pulse/database-setup/general-database-instructions#manage-the-tables-monitored-by-pulse).
   :::

2. Navigate to [Prisma Data Platform](https://pris.ly/pdp) to enable Pulse.

3. Submit the database connection string and region in the **Database connection** section.

4. In your project environment configuration for Pulse, enter the publication name (e.g., `$PUBLICATION_NAME`) in the **Publication name** field. To access this, toggle the **Automatic setup** button in the **Database replication** section (available with a [paid plan](https://www.prisma.io/pricing#pulse)).

5. After toggling **Automatic setup**, the button will transition to **Advanced setup**, and a textbox labeled **Publication name** will appear.

6. Paste the publication name you created in Neon in *step 1*.

7. Click **Enable Pulse**.

Your Neon database is now Pulse-ready! Follow our [getting started](/pulse/getting-started#21-install-the-pulse-client-extension) guide to see how to use Pulse in your application.
