This section provides step-by-step instructions to make a [Neon](https://neon.tech/) database compatible with Prisma Pulse.

## 1. Enable logical replication on Neon

To enable logical replication on Neon, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project in the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/).
2. Go to the **Project settings** section from the Neon Dashboard.
3. Go to the **Beta** section in **Project Settings**.
4. Click on **Enable**.

      You may be restricted from enabling logical replications due to an Enrollment Pause for the Neon logical replication beta phase. Learn more about enabling logical replication in Neon [here](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon#enabling-logical-replication-in-neon).

You have successfully enabled Logical replication for Neon. Now, follow the steps below to configure your Neon database to work with Pulse.

## 2. Create publications in Neon

After enabling logical replication on Neon, follow these steps: 

1. Create a publication to listen to database events from your Neon database. Use the **SQL Editor** in your Neon project to execute the SQL query to create a publication to listen to database change events from all tables:
   ```sql
   CREATE Publication $PUBLICATION_NAME FOR ALL TABLES;
   ```
   <br />
   <Admonition type="info">
     You can also create a publication to subscribe to database events from *specific tables*. To learn more on managing publications refer to [this](/pulse/database-setup/general-database-instructions#manage-your-own-publication-slot) section.

2. Before enabling Prisma Pulse, make sure to insert the publication name (e.g., `$PUBLICATION_NAME`) in the **Publication name** field in your project environment configuration for Pulse in the [Console](https://pris.ly/pdp):

Your Neon database is now Pulse-ready! Follow our [getting started](/pulse/getting-started#21-install-the-pulse-client-extension) guide to see how to use Pulse in your application.
