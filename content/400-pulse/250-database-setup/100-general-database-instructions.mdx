Prepare your database to work with Pulse.

> Prisma Pulse requires a publicly accessible PostgreSQL (**version 12+**) database withÂ logical replicationÂ enabled. To configure specific database providers for Prisma Pulse, visit [here](/pulse/database-setup#provider-specific-instructions).

## Database Replication

Database replication is the process of creating copies of a database and storing them across various on-premises or cloud destinations. Prisma Pulse uses logical replication to monitor your database for changes.

### Enable logical replication

##### [`wal_level`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html)

Some providers may not allow direct access to this setting. If you are unable to change this setting, please refer to the provider-specific guides for further assistance.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
```

You will need to restart the database after changing this setting.

##### Optional settings

###### [`wal_keep_size`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)

Setting `wal_keep_size` increases the memory usage of the [write-ahead log](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html) on your PostgreSQL database.

We recommend setting a value for `wal_keep_size` tailored to your database's storage capacity. This ensures smooth operation of both your database and Prisma Pulse.

> We suggest setting these values initially and adjusting them if necessary.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_keep_size = 2048;
```

###### [`max_replication_slots`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)

Prisma Pulse only needs one replication slot available. You can set the `max_replication_slots` if you have other replications in use.

> We suggest setting these values initially and adjusting them if necessary.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 20;
```

###### [`REPLICA IDENTITY`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html#SQL-ALTERTABLE-REPLICA-IDENTITY)

To get the **before** values of **all fields** in the record for some events, you must set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` on the table(s) you want to get field values for. If this is not configured, defining a filter for those events will only be possible on the primary key.

For example, running the following SQL command will set the `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` on a table named `User`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public."User" REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

### Manage your own publication slot

If you want to enable replication forÂ *specific models*Â or use a database provider that restricts superuser access for Prisma Pulse our advanced setup allows you to configure your own publication slot and use it to enable Pulse.

#### Creating a publication slot

You can create publications in the following ways below depending on the version of your PostgreSQL database.

<details>

<summary>Publication for all models.</summary>

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION $PUBLICATION_NAME FOR ALL TABLES;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Publication for specific fields.</summary>

For example, create a publication that publishes all changes for tableÂ `users`, but replicates only columns `user_id` and `firstname`:

```sql
   CREATE PUBLICATION users_filtered FOR TABLE users (user_id, firstname);
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Publication for specific models.</summary>

For example, create a publication that publishes all changes in two tables:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION user_and_department_publication FOR TABLE users, departments;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Publication for a model with a `WHERE` clause on itâ€™s fields.</summary>

For example, create a publication that publishes all changes from active `departments`:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION active_departments FOR TABLE departments WHERE (active IS TRUE);
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Publication based on DML operations.</summary>{' '}

For example, create a publication that only publishes `INSERT` operations in one table:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION insert_only FOR TABLE departments
WITH (publish = 'insert');
```

> `publish` (`string`)
>
> This parameter determines which DML operations will be published by the new publication to the subscribers. The value is comma-separated list of operations. The allowed operations are `insert`, `update`, `delete`, and `truncate`. The default is to publish all actions, and so the default value for this option is `'insert, update, delete, truncate'`.

You can learn more about the PostgreSQL's `CREATE PUBLICATION`, supported versions and see more examples [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html).

</details>

#### Submit your publication slot

You can submit the publication name in the [Platform console](https://console.prisma.io/), before enabling Prisma Pulse:

1. To view your [publications](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-publication-tables.html), execute:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables;
   ```

2. Then you can submit the desired publication name in the Platform console:

   ![](/img/pulse/replication-slot-submission.png)

#### Removing publications

If you are managing your replications independently and choose to disable Prisma Pulse for a particular environment, you can refer to the following SQL queries to remove your publications.

1. To delete a publication:

   ```sql
   DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS "$PUBLICATION_SLOT_NAME";
   ```

2. View your [publications](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-publication-tables.html):

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables;
   ```
