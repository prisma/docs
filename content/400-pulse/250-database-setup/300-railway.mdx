[Railway.app](https://railway.app) offers an excellent [templates feature](https://railway.app/templates). If you wish to quickly start with Prisma Pulse, you can use either of two templates:

- [Prisma Pulse DB Only](https://railway.app/template/pulse-pg): Provides a fresh, pre-configured PostgreSQL database which you can use with Prisma Pulse.
- [Prisma Pulse DB & App](https://railway.app/template/pulse-starter): Provides a pre-configured PostgreSQL database and a [Prisma Pulse starter app](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter).

## Setup using the template

<br />

1. Deploy the [template](https://railway.app/template/pulse-pg) on Railway

2. Click on the service called `restart-db-then-delete-me`.

3. You will see a list of deployments under the **Deployments** tab.

4. Click the most recent build's **View Logs** button.

5. Click on the **Deploy Logs** tab.

> If the service ran correctly, you should see a message in the logs that says "All done please restart the database" along with your `DATABASE_URL` connection string.

6. Copy the `DATABASE_URL` connection string and save it for later. Then restart your Railway database.

   - Click on your database.

   - Navigate to the Deployments tab.

   - Go into the three-dots menu on the latest deployment and click the `Restart` option.

7. After restarting your database. Click on the `restart-db-then-delete-me` service and navigate to the **Settings** tab.

8. Scroll down to the bottom and click the red **Delete Service** button.

   > Note: If you would like to use this service and the corresponding repository to create a new Prisma Pulse project. You can do so by cloning the repo from your GitHub account to your local machine.

   - Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the following command:

     ```bash

     bash rm config-db.ts

     ```

   - Then remove the script `start: ts-node config-db.ts` from the `scripts` object in the `package.json` file.

     > This is to prevent the script from running every time you push up to the repo associated with the `restart-db-then-delete-me` service.

## Setup without using a template

<br />

1. Change the PostgreSQL database settings

   You can run these queries in the Railway Database **Query** tab, using the [railway cli](https://docs.railway.app/databases/postgresql), or any other way you might run queries on your database.

   - Set the <inlinecode>[wal_level](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html)</inlinecode> to `logical`:

     ```sql
     ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
     ```

   - Set the <inlinecode>[max_replication_slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)</inlinecode> to `20`:

     ```sql
     ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 20;
     ```

   - Set the <inlinecode>[wal_keep_size](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)</inlinecode> to `2048`:

     ```sql
     ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_keep_size = 2048;
     ```

   - Reload the PostgreSQL configuration:

     ```sql
     SELECT pg_reload_conf();
     ```

2. Restart your database

   - Click on your database.

   - Navigate to the Deployments tab.

   - Go into the three-dots menu on the latest deployment and click the `Restart` option.

After setting up your Railway database, you have to use the [connection string](https://docs.railway.app/guides/postgresql#tcp-proxy-connection) provided by Railway that allows public access your PostgreSQL database.
