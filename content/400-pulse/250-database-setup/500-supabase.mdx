You have to use a direct database connection from Supabase to use it with Prisma Pulse.

## Getting a direct connection string from Supabase for Pulse

1. Follow the Supabase docs and copy the direct [database connection string](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#direct-connections). Use this to enable Pulse for your project environment.

    :::info
    Prisma Pulse is currently incompatible with Supabase's connection pooler because Supabase intercepts communication between your database and Prisma Pulse, disrupting the [Streaming Replication Protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-replication.html#PROTOCOL-REPLICATION). This protocol is used by Prisma Pulse to transmit replication commands to the database.

2. Use the direct database connection string to [enable Prisma Pulse for your project](/pulse/getting-started#1-enable-pulse-in-the-platform-console).
