You have to use a direct database connection from Supabase to use it with Prisma Pulse.

## Getting a direct connection string from Supabase for Pulse

1. Follow the Supabase docs and copy the direct [database connection string](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#direct-connections). Use this to enable Pulse for your project environment.

    :::info
    Prisma Pulse is currently incompatible with Supabase's connection pooler because Supabase intercepts communication between your database and Prisma Pulse, disrupting the [Streaming Replication Protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-replication.html#PROTOCOL-REPLICATION). This protocol is used by Prisma Pulse to transmit replication commands to the database.

2. Use the direct database connection string to [enable Prisma Pulse for your project](/pulse/getting-started#1-enable-pulse-in-the-platform-console).

    :::info
    Please ensure that SSL is enabled for your Supabase database connection. By default, Prisma Pulse requires SSL to be enabled for the database connection.
    If you would like to disable SSL check, append `?sslmode=disable` to the Supabase direct database connection string while enabling Pulse.
