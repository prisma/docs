## What is Prisma Pulse?

[Prisma Pulse](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/pulse) is managed infrastructure that captures databases events (i.e. create, update and delete operations) and distributes them to your applications.

It lets you subsribe to any changes happening in your database using [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) to power **real-time use cases** in your applications, such as:

- chat and messaging
- data syncing (e.g. into a search index)
- social interaction and collaboration
- notifying users
- updating inventories
- managing payments
- ... and any other functionality that requires real-time updates

Prisma Pulse integrates with [Prisma ORM](/orm) and easily lets you subscribe database changes in a type-safe way using Prisma Client:

## Why Prisma Pulse?

Building real-time functionality based on changes that occur in your database can be very complicated. Common approaches like _polling_, implementing _application-level updates_ or using _additional infrastructure_ (like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ) either don't scale, are very costly or come with substantial development and maintenance overhead.

Prisma Pulse is based on the idea of _unidirectional data flow_ which is implemented via [Change Data Capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) (CDC). CDC gets rid of the deficincies of the other approaches and solves the problem of reacting to database events in a robust and elegant manner.

Here is an overview of the main features Prisma Pulse provides:

- Reacting to database changes with type-safe model subscriptions
- Unidirectional data flow via Change Data Capture
- Great DX integrated with usage of Prisma ORM (easy setup, development and maintenance)
- Works with your existing database
- Insights dashboard lets you view and understand all database events captured by Pulse
- Enable, disable and manage Pulse via the [Platform CLI](/platform/platform-cli/)

## How does Prisma Pulse work?

Prisma Pulse uses CDC to efficiently observe and capture database changes as they occur. By monitoring the database's transaction log (e.g. the Write-Ahead-Log in PostgreSQL), Prisma Pulse identifies change events like inserts, updates, and deletes without impacting the database's performance.

The captured events are processed, evaluated, and distributed to all Prisma Client instances that subscribed to them:

## What can you build with Prisma Pulse?

Prisma Pulse can power real-time functionality like chat, notifications, data broadcast, data synchronization, and more. It's ideal for ensuring data consistency in distributed systems, enhancing real-time user experiences.
