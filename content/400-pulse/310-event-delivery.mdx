This page gives an overview of the event delivery semantics of Prisma Pulse. 

## What are event delivery semantics?

Event delivery semantics describe  the _guarantees_ an event producer can provide about the delivery of events in an event-driven architecture. 

There generally are three kinds of delivery guarantees:
- **At most once**: The event is delivered either once or not at all.
- **At least once**: The event is delivered one or more times, ensuring it never goes undelivered.
- **Exactly once**: The event is delivered exactly once, avoiding duplicates.

## Event delivery semantics in Prisma Pulse

### At least once delivery

When streaming database change events with `.stream()`, database change events are guaranteed to be delivered with _at least once_ semantics, meaning that Prisma Pulse can guarantee that any event happening in the database will be delivered one or more times.

### Delivery of events in the right order

Prisma Pulse further guarantees to deliver the database change events in the order they were produced.
