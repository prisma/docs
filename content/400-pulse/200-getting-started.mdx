## Prerequisites

<Admonition type="info">

Prisma Pulse currently supports PostgreSQL. We'd love to hear [which databases](https://tally.so/r/wLbb8G) you would like to see supported next.

</Admonition>

To get started with Pulse, you will need the following:

- A [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io) account
- The **connection string** of a Pulse-ready database (if you don't have one yet, you can configure your database the instructions [here](/pulse/database-setup) or [use a Railway template](https://railway.app/template/pulse-pg?referralCode=VQ09uv))

## 1. Enable Pulse in the Platform Console

### 1.1. Choose the environment you want to enable Pulse for

Open the [Platform Console](https://console.prisma.io), navigate to your workspace of choice, then select the project and choose the environment in which you want to enable Pulse.

If you don't have a project yet in your workspace, you can create a new one.

### 1.2. Enable Pulse

In the project environment of your choice, click the **Enable Pulse** button.

### 1.3. Configure Pulse

The Pulse **Setup** screen requires you to:

- provide your **Database connection string**
- select a **Region** where Pulse should be hosted
- decide whether you want to use the **Automatic setup** for [**Database replication**](/pulse/concepts#logical-replication) (only available on paid plans)

When you're done with that, click the **Enable Pulse** button at the bottom of the screen. This will test the connectivity to your database.

### 1.4. Generate an API key

<Admonition>

If you already have an API key for your current environment, you can skip this step und use the existing API key for using Prisma Pulse.

</Admonition>

You can generate an API key by clicking the **Generate API key** button. Store the API key in a secure location or add it to the `.env` file of your project:

```env file=.env
PULSE_API_KEY="your_secure_pulse_api_key"
```

You won't be able to access the same API key again afterwards.

## 2. Add Pulse to your application

With Pulse enabled, proceed with these steps to integrate Pulse into your application. You can also utilize our [example repository](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter) on GitHub as a reference guide.

### 2.1. Install the Pulse Client extension

<Admonition>

Pulse requires [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) version `4.16.1` or higher and [`@prisma/extension-pulse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-pulse) version `1.0.1` or higher

</Admonition>

Install the Pulse Client extension:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/extension-pulse@latest
```

### 2.2. Extend your Prisma Client instance with the Pulse extension

Add the following to extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Prisma Pulse extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({ apiKey: process.env.PULSE_API_KEY })
)
```

### 2.3. Create your first Pulse subscription

With the Pulse extension applied, you can use Pulse's `subscribe()` method on any model defined in your Prisma Schema to subscribe to data change events.

In the below example, it is assumed that your Prisma schema has a `User` model. A subscription is made to that `User` model that listens for _any_ change event on that table:

<TabbedContent code>
<TabItem value="Subscription">

```ts highlight=9-13;add
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({ apiKey: process.env.PULSE_API_KEY })
)

async function main() {
  const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe()

  for await (const event of subscription) {
    console.log('just received an event:', event)
  }
}

main()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Prisma schema">

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
}
```

</TabItem>

</TabbedContent>

## 3. Test your subscription

After running the code snippet above, you can test the subscription by _creating_, _updating_ or _deleting_ a `User` record in your database. 

You can do that using Prisma Studio (by running `npx prisma studio`) or by using any other database client of your choice (like [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico2/) or `psql`).

If everything worked, you should see the event being logged to the terminal where you can the code snippet from above. ðŸŽ‰

## Next steps

You can try out more filters on your Pulse subscription, for example:

**Subscribe only to `create` events**:

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  create: { },
})
```

**Subscribe only to `update` events**:

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  update: { },
})
```


**Subscribe only to `delete` events**:

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({
  delete: { },
})
```

Pulse offers even more fine-grained filters than these. You can explore these in the [API reference](/pulse/api-reference).
