## Prerequisites

<Admonition type="info">

Prisma Pulse currently supports PostgreSQL. We'd love to hear [which databases](https://tally.so/r/wLbb8G) you would like to see supported next.

</Admonition>

You'll need the following to integrate Pulse into your application:

- A [Prisma Data Platform workspace](https://console.prisma.io).
- [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) version `4.16.1` or higher and [`@prisma/extension-pulse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-pulse) version `1.0.1` or higher.
- A publicly accessible PostgreSQL (version 12+) database with [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-quick-setup.html) enabled. View our [setup guide](/pulse/database-setup/general-database-instructions#enable-logical-replication) on configuring logical replication for your database.

## 1. Enable Pulse

Navigate to your Prisma Data Platform project, choose an environment, and enable Pulse. We'll connect to your database and verify connectivity during setup.

> Once enabled, you'll be prompted to generate an API key that you'll use in your extended Prisma Client to authenticate requests. Store this API key in your application's `.env` file:
>
> ```env file=.env showLineNumbers
> PULSE_API_KEY="your_secure_pulse_api_key"
> ```

## 2. Add Pulse to your application

With Pulse enabled, proceed with these steps to integrate Pulse into your application. You can also utilize our [example repository](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter) on GitHub as a reference guide.

### 2.1. Install the Pulse Client extension

<Admonition>

Pulse requires [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) version `4.16.1` or higher and [`@prisma/extension-pulse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-pulse) version `1.0.1` or higher

</Admonition>

Install the latest version of Prisma Client and the Pulse Client extension

```bash
npm install @prisma/client@latest @prisma/extension-pulse@latest
```

### 2.2. Extend your Prisma Client instance with the Pulse extension

Add the following to extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Prisma Pulse extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({ apiKey: process.env.PULSE_API_KEY })
)
```

<Admonition type="note">

You stored this API key in your .env file after [enabling Pulse](#1-enable-pulse). If needed, you can navigate to your respective project environment and generate a new API key.

</Admonition>

### 2.3. Create your first Pulse subscription

With the Pulse extension applied, you can use Pulse's `subscribe()` method on any model defined in your Prisma Schema to subscribe to data change events.

In the below example, a subscription is made to a `notification` model that listens for _any_ change event on that table:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withPulse({ apiKey: apiKey }))

async function main() {
  const subscription = await prisma.notification.subscribe()

  for await (const event of subscription) {
    console.log('just received a notification:', event)
  }
}

main()
```

All done! You've successfully added Pulse to your application. Explore next steps to learn more.

## Next steps

[Navigate to the API section](/pulse/api-reference) to explore available filtering options for Pulse's `subscribe()` method.

```ts
const subscription = await prisma.notification.subscribe({
  create: {
    userId: 123, // subscribe to all notifications created for the user with ID 123
  },
})
```
