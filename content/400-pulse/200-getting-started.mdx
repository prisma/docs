## Prerequisites

You'll need the following to integrate Pulse into your application;

- [Prisma Data Platform workspace](https://console.prisma.io)
- [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) version `4.16.1` or higher and [`@prisma/extension-pulse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-pulse) version `v0.2.3` or higher.
- A publicly accessible PostgreSQL (version 12+) database with [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-quick-setup.html) enabled. View our [setup guide](/pulse/database-setup/general-database-instructions#enable-logical-replication) on configuring logical replication for your database.

## 1. Enable Pulse

Navigate to your Prisma Data Platform project, choose an environment, and enable Pulse. We'll connect to your database and verify connectivity during setup.

> Once enabled, you'll be prompted to create an API key that you'll use in your extended Prisma Client to authenticate requests. Store this API key in your application's `.env` file:
>
> ```env file=.env
> PULSE_API_KEY="your_secure_pulse_api_key"
> ```

## 2. Add Pulse to your application

With Pulse enabled, proceed with these steps to integrate Pulse into your application. You can also utilize our [example repository](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter) on GitHub as a reference guide.

### 2.1. Install the Pulse Client extension

<Admonition>

ðŸ’¡ Pulse requires [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) version `4.16.1` or higher and [`@prisma/extension-pulse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-pulse) version `0.2.3` or higher

</Admonition>

Install the latest version of Prisma Client and the Pulse Client extension

```bash
npm install @prisma/client@latest @prisma/extension-pulse@latest
```

### 2.2. Extend your Prisma Client instance with the Pulse extension

Add the following to extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Prisma Pulse extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({ apiKey: process.env.PULSE_API_KEY })
)
```

<Admonition type="info">

You should have received an **API key** when you added Prisma Pulse to your environment in the Platform Console.

</Admonition>

### 2.3. Create your first Prisma Pulse subscription

With the Prisma Pulse extension applied, you may now use Prisma Pulse's `subscribe()` method on any model defined in your Prisma Schema to subscribe to data change events.

In the example below, a subscription is made on a `user` table that listens for _any_ change event on that table:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withPulse({ apiKey: apiKey }))

async function main() {
  const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({})

  if (subscription instanceof Error) {
    throw subscription
  }

  // Example: Set a timeout to the subscription after 60 seconds.
  // Explicitly stopping the subscriptions and closing the connection is needed
  // to not exhaust the limited number of subscriptions allowed per table.

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Stopping the subscription.')
    subscription.stop()
  }, 60000)

  for await (const event of subscription) {
    console.log('just received an event:', event)
  }
}

main()
```

Refer to the [API Reference](/pulse/api-reference) section for more detail on the filtering options available to the `subscribe()` method.

## Database setup

<Admonition>

Prisma Pulse requires a publicly accessible PostgreSQL (version 12+) database with logical replication enabled.

To setup your database to work with Prisma Pulse, refer to the [database setup page](/pulse/database-setup).
