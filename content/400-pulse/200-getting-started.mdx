## Prerequisites

To participate in Pulse's Early Access program, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- A GitHub account.
- Pulse requires [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) version `4.16.1` or higher and [`@prisma/extension-pulse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-pulse) version `v0.2.2` or higher.
- A publicly accessible PostgreSQL database.
- Ability to use the superuser account of the database instance. In the future, we will support the ability to connect to your database from Pulse with a limited access, non-superuser account.

You will also need a database with the following configurations:

- PostgreSQL version 12+.
- Ensure your database is publicly accessible.
- [Set the `wal_level` setting in PostgreSQL to `logical`](/pulse/getting-started#wal_level).
- A database superuser that can be used for connections inside Pulse.
- Connect to the database using `sslmode=disable` if the database provider uses self-signed certificates. _This is a Prisma Pulse [Early Access](/platform/maturity-levels#early-access) limitation that will be lifted before Prisma Pulse [General Availability](platform/maturity-levels#general-availability)_.

## 1. Database setup

### General database configuration

#### Required settings

##### [<inlinecode id="wal_level">wal_level</inlinecode>](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html)

Some providers may not allow direct access to this setting. If you are unable to change this setting, please refer to the provider-specific guides for further assistance.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
```

You will need to restart the database after changing this setting.

#### Optional settings

The following increases the memory usage of the [write-ahead log](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html) on your PostgreSQL database. We suggest setting these values initially and adjusting them if necessary.

##### <inlinecode>[max_replication_slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)</inlinecode>

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 20;
```

##### <inlinecode>[wal_keep_size](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)</inlinecode>

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_keep_size = 2048;
```

#### Configuring replication slots

If the database you use with Prisma Pulse allows superuser access, Prisma Pulse will automatically manage the creation and removal of your logical replication slots.

When Prisma Pulse is enabled, it creates a replication slot that is enabled for **all tables**. The replication slot will automatically be deleted when you disable Prisma Pulse.

Suppose you want to enable replication for specific models or use a database provider that doesn’t allow super user access for Prisma Pulse to manage replication slots (e.g. when using a database provider such as _Neon_). In that case, you must create and submit your replication slot before enabling Prisma Pulse.

Our **paid plan** users can provide a **slot name** (the replication slot name) and a **publication name** (the publication slot name).

1. Create a replication slot:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('$REPLICATION_SLOT_NAME', 'pgoutput');
```

Learn more [here](https://pgpedia.info/p/pg_create_logical_replication_slot.html). 2. View your replication slots:

```sql
SELECT
  pg_size_pretty(pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), restart_lsn)) as restart_diff,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), confirmed_flush_lsn)) as confirmed_flush_diff,
  *
FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

3. You can create publication slots in the following ways below depending on the version of your PostgreSQL database:

   - Publication slots for specific tables/models. For example, create a publication that publishes all changes in two tables:

   ```sql
   CREATE PUBLICATION user_and_department_publication FOR TABLE users, departments;
   ```

   - Publication slots for a table/model with a `WHERE` clause on it’s fields. For example, create a publication that publishes all changes from active `departments`:

   ```sql
   CREATE PUBLICATION active_departments FOR TABLE departments WHERE (active IS TRUE);
   ```

   - Publication slots for specific fields. For example, create a publication that publishes all changes for table `users`, but replicates only columns `user_id` and `firstname`:

   ```sql
   CREATE PUBLICATION users_filtered FOR TABLE users (user_id, firstname);
   ```

   - Publication slot based on DML operations. For example, create a publication that only publishes `INSERT` operations in one table:

   ```sql
   CREATE PUBLICATION insert_only FOR TABLE departments
     WITH (publish = 'insert');
   ```

   > `publish` (`string`)
   >
   > This parameter determines which DML operations will be published by the new publication to the subscribers. The value is comma-separated list of operations. The allowed operations are `insert`, `update`, `delete`, and `truncate`. The default is to publish all actions, and so the default value for this option is `'insert, update, delete, truncate'`.

Learn more about the PostgreSQL's `CREATE PUBLICATION` and find more examples [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html).

4. Then you can submit the replication slot name and the publication slot name in the Platform console, before enabling Prisma Pulse:
   ![](./images/replication-slot-submission.png)

### Clearing replication and publication slots

1. View your replication slots:

```sql
SELECT
    pg_size_pretty(pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), restart_lsn)) as restart_diff,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), confirmed_flush_lsn)) as confirmed_flush_diff,
    *
FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

2. To delete a replication slot:

```sql
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot(slot_name) FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_name = '$REPLICATION_SLOT_NAME';
```

> ℹ️ Active replication slot cannot be deleted, please ensure you’ve disabled Prisma Pulse before you’re attempting to delete the replication slot.

3. To delete a publication slot:

```sql
DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS "$PUBLICATION_SLOT_NAME";
```

### Provider specific configuration

To learn about the database providers that Pulse supports, visit [here](/pulse/faq#what-database-providers-are-supported-with-pulse).

#### Railway

[Railway.app](https://railway.app) offers an excellent [templates feature](https://railway.app/templates). If you wish to quickly start with Pulse, you can use either of two templates:

- [Prisma Pulse DB Only](https://railway.app/template/pulse-pg): Provides a fresh, pre-configured PostgreSQL database which you can use with Pulse.
- [Prisma Pulse DB & App](https://railway.app/template/pulse-starter): Provides a pre-configured PostgreSQL database and a [Pulse starter app](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter).

##### Setup without using a template

<details><summary>1. Change the PostgreSQL database settings</summary>

You can run these queries in the Railway Database **Query** tab, using the [railway cli](https://docs.railway.app/databases/postgresql), or any other way you might run queries on your database.

1. Set the <inlinecode>[wal_level](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html)</inlinecode> to `logical`:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
```

2. Set the <inlinecode>[max_replication_slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)</inlinecode> to `20`:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 20;
```

3. Set the <inlinecode>[wal_keep_size](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)</inlinecode> to `2048`:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_keep_size = 2048;
```

4. Reload the PostgreSQL configuration:

```sql
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>2. Restart your database</summary>

1. Click on your database.

2. Navigate to the Deployments tab.

3. Go into the three-dots menu on the latest deployment and click the `Restart` option.

</details>

##### SSL mode

As Railway uses a self-signed certificate, you have to use [`sslmode=disable`](/orm/overview/databases/postgresql#configuring-an-ssl-connection) with Pulse. _This is a Prisma Pulse [Early Access](/platform/maturity-levels#early-access) limitation that will be lifted before Prisma Pulse [General Availability](platform/maturity-levels#general-availability)_.

## 2. Enable Pulse in a project

Log into the [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/login), create a new project and enable Pulse for that new project.

> An API key will be created after you enable and setup Pulse in your [project](/platform/concepts/projects).

## 3. Use Pulse in your application

<Admonition type="info">

We have created an [example repository](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter) on GitHub to help you get started using Pulse. If you would like to start there, you can do so.

</Admonition>

The following will show how you can utilize Pulse in an existing application. We will be adding Pulse to the [hello-prisma](/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql) example from our documentation.

### 3.1. Install the Pulse Prisma Client extension

In a project using [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client), run the following command to install the Pulse extension:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/extension-pulse
```

### Store your Pulse API key in your .env file

The Pulse extension requires you to use an API key.

<Admonition type="info">

You should have received an API key when you added Prisma Pulse to your project in the Platform Console.

</Admonition>

In `.env`, add a variable named `PULSE_API_KEY`:

```env file=.env
PULSE_API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY"

# Example:
# PULSE_API_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcGlfa2V5IjoiNGMxNzM0MGItMmFhYy00MGMxLWE1ZDctNzYyNmRjNjg3NjM4IiwidGVuYW50X2lkIjoiY2VhZjE0NThkZGUyYzJmNTU0ZmNkNTI2MmFmOWY1ODljMWJiZmRhNDU0N2UxMjM1ODk3MGQ2MGI1ZjRlNTU0OCIsImludGVybmFsX3NlY3JldCI6ImM1ZTcxYjJhLTE0NzdawdwDliZS1hM2IzLTczODFkNDM5ZmEwZSJ9.wCUlghC_suFBr2vnk0q_5I8iRNRDyEQo0W9rnhf6mCw"
```

### 3.2. Create a Pulse-enabled Prisma Client

To use Pulse, you must extend Prisma Client with the Pulse extension.
Add the following to extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Pulse extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({ apiKey: process.env.PULSE_API_KEY })
)
```

### 3.3. Create your first Pulse subscription

With the Pulse extension applied, you may now use Pulse's `subscribe()` method on any model defined in your Prisma Schema to subscribe to data change events.

In the example below, a subscription is made on a `user` table that listens for _any_ change event on that table:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withPulse({ apiKey: apiKey }))

async function main() {
  const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({})

  if (subscription instanceof Error) {
    throw subscription
  }

  // Example: Set a timeout to the subscription after 60 seconds.
  // Explicitly stopping the subscriptions and closing the connection is needed
  // to not exhaust the limited number of subscriptions allowed per table.

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Stopping the subscription.')
    subscription.stop()
  }, 60000)

  for await (const event of subscription) {
    console.log('just received an event:', event)
  }
}

main()
```

Refer to the [API Reference](/pulse/api-reference) section for more detail on the filtering options available to the `subscribe()` method.
