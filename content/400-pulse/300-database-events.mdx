## Structure

The structure of a datasbase change event depends on the kind of operation that was performed. You can learn more in the [API reference](/pulse/api-reference).

### `create`

```js
{
  action: 'create',
  created: { id: 3, email: 'jane@prisma.io', name: 'Jane Doe' },
  id: '0/2A5A590',
  modelName: 'User'
}
```

### `update`

```js
{
  action: 'update',
  after: { id: 2, email: 'hi@prisma.com', name: 'asd2345' },
  before: null,
  id: '0/2A5A248',
  modelName: 'User'
}
```

### `delete`

Here is an example:

```js
 {
  action: 'delete',
  deleted: { id: 1 },
  id: '0/2A5A398',
  modelName: 'User'
}
```

## Delivery semantics

This page gives an overview of the event delivery semantics of Prisma Pulse. 

### What are event delivery semantics?

Event delivery semantics describe  the _guarantees_ an event producer can provide about the delivery of events in an event-driven architecture. 

There generally are three kinds of delivery guarantees:
- **At most once**: The event is delivered either once or not at all.
- **At least once**: The event is delivered one or more times, ensuring it never goes undelivered.
- **Exactly once**: The event is delivered exactly once, avoiding duplicates.

### Event delivery semantics in Prisma Pulse

#### `stream()`

When using `stream()`, Prisma Pulse provides the following delivery guarantees.

##### At least once delivery

When streaming database change events with `.stream()`, database change events are guaranteed to be delivered with _at least once_ semantics, meaning that Prisma Pulse can guarantee that any event happening in the database will be delivered one or more times.

##### Delivery of events in the right order

Prisma Pulse further guarantees to deliver the database change events in the order they were produced. 

##### Exactly once delivery

While Pulse by default offers _at least once_ semantics, it also provides the _primitives_ for you to implement _exactly once_ delivery guarantees yourself!

Each event produced by Prisma Pulse carries an identifier/idempotency key that you can use to deduplicate during downstream processing of the event. This is best implemented by passing the identifier along to external services that support idempotency or using concepts like upsert when working with a database.

The `id` field in this event payload for a `User` model represent the identifier/idempotency key:

```js
{
  action: 'update',
  after: { id: 1, name: 'Jane', email: "doe@prisma.io" },
  before: null,
  // highlight-next-line
  id: '0/1981650',
  modelName: 'User'
}
```

#### `subscribe()`

##### At most once delivery

When streaming database change events with `.stream()`, database change events are guaranteed to be delivered with _at least once_ semantics, meaning that Prisma Pulse can guarantee that any event happening in the database will be delivered one or more times.

##### Delivery of events in the right order

Prisma Pulse further guarantees to deliver the database change events in the order they were produced. 


## Event persistence

The ability to persist events enables the _at least once_ delivery guarantees provided by `stream()`. Prisma Pulse, you need to use `stream()` and configure your Pulse in your Console [project](/pulse/about#projects) to use **Event persistence**.
