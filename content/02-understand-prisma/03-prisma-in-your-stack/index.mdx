## Overview

Prisma is a database toolkit that simplifies database access. You can use Prisma tools to build a GraphQL or REST API, or as part of a fullstack application - the extent to which you incorporate Prisma is up to you.

> **Tip**: If you are building a GraphQL API, check out [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/) - code first GraphQL schemas with [a plugin specifically for Prisma](https://nexus.js.org/docs/nexus-prisma).
