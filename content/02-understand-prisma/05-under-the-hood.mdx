## Overview

This page gives an overview of the Prisma internals and how it works "under the hood".

Note that **this page does not contain any practical information that is relevant for _using_ Prisma**. It rather aims at providing a _mental model_ for what the Prisma toolkit _actually_ is and how the different tools that are available to developers are structured.

If you're new to Prisma, be sure to check out the [Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart) and [Introduction](introduction) pages first.

## Modules and interfaces

The tools in the Prisma toolkit are built with respect to two dimensions:

- **Module**: A set of functionality that's offered by Prisma
- **Interface**: A way to _use_ the functionality of a module

The following illustration gives an overview of the tools that exist (or are planned) in the Prisma toolkit:

### Modules

Prisma provides a number of features which are implemented in the form of _modules_. Here is an overview of the modules Prisma provides:

- **Query**: Send queries to your database
- **Migrate**: Perform schema migrations in your database
- **Introspect**: Read a database schema and translate into [Prisma data model](../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model)
- **Schema**: Construct and modify a [Prisma schema file](../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/prisma-schema-file)
- **Generate**: Generate clients for Prisma data sources

### Interface

_Interfaces_ offer a way to actually _use_ the functionality of a module. The module-interface-matrix above shows four different levels of interfaces (from bottom to top):

- **Engines** Implements the _core functionality_ consumed by the higher-level interfaces
- **Library**: A way to _programmatically_ use the functionality of a module
- **CLI**: A way to use the functionality of a module on the _command line_
- **GUI**: A way to _visually_ use the functionality of a module

## Prisma engines

At the core of each module, there typically is a [Prisma engine](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines) that implements the core set of functionality. Engines are implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and expose a low-level API that is used by the higher-level interfaces.

A Prisma engine is the **direct interface to the database**, any higher-level interfaces always communicate with the database _through_ the engine-layer.

As an example, Prisma Client connects to the [query engine](../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/query-engine) in order to read and write data in a database:
