 * Paid-acquisition attribution, shaped for PostHog person properties.
 *
 * Purchases can happen months after the ad click — far outside any ad
 * platform's conversion window — so paid attribution has to live on the person,
 * not on a conversion event. These properties ride along with the PostHog
 * person from the anonymous marketing-site visit through signup on the console
 * and every later event, including a server-side `purchase`.
 *
 * GDPR note: this only ever runs behind PostHog's own consent gate (PostHog is
 * initialised opted-out and only opts in on CookieYes analytics consent), so
 * declining analytics means none of this is recorded. Coverage is therefore
 * bounded by the analytics opt-in rate — it is not, and cannot be, 100%.
